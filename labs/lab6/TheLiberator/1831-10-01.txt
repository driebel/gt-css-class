 Yale Commencement. The New Haven papers contain glowing descriptions of the recent anniversary of this venerable Institution. We are glad, surely, that 'the soul of the right arm of the right eye of Connecticut' is in such good case; but we cannot help thinking, as we read these sketches, that they manifest far too much regal parade of learning, and are leading too directly to a rank aristocracy of knowledge, for plain-hearted, patriotic Republicans. We cannot help thinking, too, of the fate which has been visited on the 'Education Reporter:' a publication devoted with powerful energy to the cause of universal enlightenment; of Silliman's Journal, which is suffered to linger along, half supported; of the recent spirit of monopoly, and apologizing for mental oppression, shown by the upholders of Yale in refusing to establish a colored College beside it; and our heart refuses to participate in the general eclat. Such inconsistencies and acts of injustice as these, affix a shame on our Literati, which the 'glory' of a thousand such Commencements; yea, which 'all the chemistry of the world' can never wash away. Stonington Phenix.

 No man, who is continually vacillating, and never moves with any decision of character and judgment, until he has a host of nominally great men to 'back him up,' will ever do any thing for the cause of humanity, worthy to be recorded on the page of history; and no man of such character, is worthy to be enrolled with the real, disinterested friends of equal rights.In any great moral or political enterprise, there must always be some one to move first; and hence, that one, almost as a matter of course, must stand exposed to the charge of rashness, if not to the charge of acting from improper motives. Such evils and reproaches are no more than were suffered by Luther and other reformers, whose imputed obstinacy and rashness have conferred the greatest blessing upon mankind. Even those who led the van, in our American Revolution, were, at first;, distrusted, as impelled by a false enthusiasm, which would involve the whole country in ruin and wretchedness. Boston Telegraph.     one first; one, rashness, Boston Telegraph.    

     From the New-York Daily Sentinel. From the New-York Daily Sentinel.             It becomes our duty to-day to record the particulars of an outrage more daring than any we remember to have heard of in this country, and one of more unjustifiable atrocity than any committed by the poor, degraded, ignorant blacks in Virginia, some of whom have been put to death, and others are under sentence of death, for their unsuccessful attempt to emancipate themselves.No one laments more the occurrence of such scenes as the Southampton massacre, than the writer of this paragraph, and no one is more desirous of preventing the recurrence of such scenes; but we believe that the only effectual method of preventing the recurrence is to speak the truth in relation to what has taken place, even though we are certain that it may prove unpalatable. Of what were the Southampton negroes guilty? Of putting to death men, women, and children. For what object? Plunder? No there is no evidence that such was their object. On the contrary, almost all the accounts concur in stating that they expected to emancipate themselves, and they no doubt thought that their only hope of doing so was to put to death, indiscriminately, the whole race of those who held them in bondage. If such were their impressions, were they not justifiable in doing so? Undoubtedly they were, if freedom is the birthright of man, as the declaration of independence tells us. If their ideas respecting their chance of success were absurd, and their plans chimerical, it is attributable to their ignorance. But who kept them in ignorance? Those who have suffered so dearly by its effects. Would the blacks have attempted their foolish project, if they had possessed even the mere rudiments of a common education? Never. They were in a state of brutal ignorance, and however absurd or cruel were their proceedings, if their object was to obtain their freedom, those who kept them in slavery and ignorance alone are answerable for their conduct. They were deluded, but their cause was just.Now let us look at the conduct of the slaveholders. They say the evil of slavery was entailed upon them that they deplore its existence, and desire its removal, and so forth. We readily grant that the evil is not of their own choosing, and no one, we believe, will contend that they are responsible for it, as they found it. But have they done what they could and should do for eradicating the evil of slavery? Have they diminished the number of slaves? Have they prepared the present generation, or made provision for preparing the next, to enjoy freedom? The answer to each of these questions involves them in guilt. The number of slaves in proportion to the number of freemen is increasing! and instead of preparing them for the enjoyment of freedom, and providing means for their gradual emancipation, Virginia yes, the state which gave birth to the immortal Jefferson, the author of the declaration that declares that all men are born free and equal that declaration which no slaveholder dare dispute the truth of Virginia! at the last session of its legislature, passed a law making it penal for a slaveholder to teach his own slaves to read and write!! Other slaveholding states we believe have passed similar laws! And now, we find that an individual, in open daylight, in a populous town, in the face of the mayor and other officers of the law, and without the least interference from them, and contrary to all law, reason, and justice, is dragged from his room, (after a forcible entry has been made to his boarding house,) taken out of town, stripped almost naked, and scourged almost to death by a mob of ferocious and cowardly slaveholders! and all this, not because he had told them the whole truth in relation to their conduct not because he had said even as much as we have, but because he had maintained in argument, what is asserted annually by innumerable orators on the nation's birthday, and universally acknowledged to be true in theory that the blacks have a right to be free!It remains to be seen whether slaveholders in general will sanction this outrage, though it is evident that no inconsiderable number of them have done so; justice, however, requires the statement that several individuals are indignant at it, one of whom, a member of the bar, has voluntarily offered to defend a suit against the perpetrators, but the gentleman who was the subject of it is not in a situation to incur the expenses of a prosecution. His friends with whom he has advised were of opinion that duty to the public requires that he should make public a statement of the case, and he has, in accordance with their wishes, furnished us with the following extracts from his Journal, which we give without further remark:August 30th, (Tuesday.) Called on Mr. Horthorn at 12 o'clock, A.M. Had a conversation on slavery. Maintained that the blacks, as men, were entitled to their freedom, and ought to be emancipated. Mr. Horthorn, his clerk, and a country doctor were the only persons present. The doctor assumed that the blacks were not men, and that they ought all to be exterminated. 'They had declared war first,' he said, 'let them be hunted like wild beasts.' I felt disgusted with the sentiment, although a similar want of sympathy for the unfortunate slaves was by no means new to me. Mrs. ----- assured me that Mrs. ----- told her last Saturday, that she would willingly cast her own slaves into the street, there to be shot, provided others, who had slaves, would agree to do the same. Mrs. ----- is a pious methodist, whose husband, also a methodist, has accumulated a little fortune by successfully gambling in lotteries; the loss of a few slaves would not be belt by the religious couple, and the shedding of innocent blood would be nothing. But, to return to my conversation with the savage doctor the fellow asked me 'how I dared express myself as I had just done before blacks.' I told him that 'I had not done so, and would not do it for fear they might misunderstand me, and think I approved of their killing women and children, which I condemned as much as any man; and this, I said, I had proved last Friday, when an alarm was given at 11 o'clock at night, and five hundred of them said to be coming down the Halifax road. I was one of the first to fly to arms, and to take the command in second of a party of men which was sent to guard the bridge at the end of Old street. This did not look as if I would countenance or defend their barbarous proceedings. Yet I would contend for their right to be free.' The man of blood disputed even the justice of my sentiments, and still contended that I was a dangerous man for expressing myself as I had done before blacks. 'I thought,' said I, 'that here we were all white!' His reply was, that he had as much white blood in him as I had, which I had never doubted, nor did I say any thing to make him think I doubted it. But the rascal (I can use no milder expression) was determined to pick up a quarrel by misrepresenting all I said. I appealed to Mr. Horthorn, and asked him, if he had understood my meaning, and whether what I had said was not as just as it was harmless. 'I understood perfectly well all you said,' said he, 'and think you are right.' Now, Mr. H. is himself a slaveholder, and by no means prepossessed in their favor. In fact, there is not a Virginian, I truly believe, whose mind would revolt at any cruelty, however atrocious, of which the blacks might be the object. I then left Mr. H's store to go to my dinner.I returned to Mr. Horthorn's in the afternoon, and complained of the unfairness with which all I had said in the morning had been twisted by my opponent. Mr. H. repeated once more that it was impossible to put two constructions upon what I had said. Yet I have a presentiment of foul play; and, though I know not why, I feel uneasy.31st, (Wednesday,) I was fast asleep at 6 o'clock this morning when Mr. Carter entered my bed room, and informed me that some of the inhabitants were determined to mob me for what I had said the day before. He advised me to leave town immediately. I could scarcely credit what he was telling me, till he told me that it was a serious business that my life was in danger, and repeated his earnest advice that I should leave Petersburg immediately. The mayor had received an anonymous letter the evening before, in which it was stated, that, although the blacks had not succeeded in their recent attempt, they would ultimately, and very soon, overcome the white population of the State of Virginia. The Mayor thought I was the author of this note, which no doubt was written by one of the actors in this morning's atrocious assault on my person.I agreed to leave Petersburg at 8 o'clock. This was told to the leaders of the mob, who expressed themselves satisfied, and promised to let me depart in peace. I made my preparations, ordered the coachman of the Richmond stage to call for me, and after parting with my worthy landlord and landlady, got into the coach, which was yet to stop at Powell's hotel, Bolingbroke-street. When we arrived there, I saw a party of fifteen or twenty men coming down Bolingbroke-street. They looked into the coach, saw that I was there, and walked off towards the bridge leading to Richmond. I guessed their purpose, and as soon as they were at a distance, I told the driver that I had forgotten something, but would be back in a few minutes. I ran to Mr. Carter's, and met Mrs. Carter on the staircase, to whom I imparted my fears. She felt greatly alarmed. In a few minutes Mr. C. made his appearance, and said he was glad to see me, for he had just ascertained that some of the ruffians were still bent on destroying me. The doors were locked, and he went to request the assistance of the civil authorities. But these, it seems, did not think it worth their while to interfere. A mob soon assembled in the street. I went up stairs, where I provided myself with a musket and a pair of horse pistols, determined then, to sell my life dearly. Fortunately for some, I had time to reflect; they allowed me full a quarter of an hour, and this saved the lives of fifteen or twenty of them, which I could easily have taken away if I had put into execution my plan of defence. I reasoned with myself thus: 'I can easily kill a score of these fellows, although I must eventually perish. In defending myself, I must cause misery to many. Some of those I may chance to kill may be fathers of large families they may be beloved sons, on whom depends, perhaps, the very existence of mothers of sisters; is it not better I should devote my own insignificant self? Life is sweet, and dear to all sensitive beings; but is it worth all the misery I am about to inflict on innocent persons? No! no!' From that moment I felt perfectly resigned to my fate. I heaved a sigh for my friends in England, in France, and in New-York; but proud am I now to reflect that, in spite of the prejudices of education, the idea of appearing before the God of my persecutors never once crossed my mind. My only regret was, that I could not write a line to bid adieu to my trusty and beloved friends in New-York. Their attachment I knew well, and a few parting lines, I was sure, would give them pleasure. But this I could not do.At last the ruffians forced themselves into the house, in spite of Mr. Carter's exertions to keep them out. He talked to them a long time, but what he said I know not. I heard his voice, and occasional bursts of laughter from the mob that's all I know. I was in hopes the civil authorities would have thought it their duty to protect me they thought otherwise.The drawing room was first visited by the blood-thirsty republicans!  I heard Mrs. Carter exclaim, 'Oh! what do you want? what are you going to do?' 'Do not be alarmed, Madam, we will not hurt you;' and not finding me in the drawing room, they ascended the staircase leading to the place where I was. A little hesitation prevailed at that moment, for I heard one of them cry out, 'Well! who comes with me? God damn! will none come?' As soon as they made their appearance at the foot of the staircase, I put down the musket I still held in my hand, and said, 'here willingly I give up my life.' They rushed on me. One dragged me down by one arm, another took hold of me by the other arm, and a third held me behind by the collar of my coat. As they were dragging me along, a pistol was fired behind me, whether at me I cannot tell. There were about a hundred or a hundred and fifty persons in the street, as nearly as I could judge. I expected to be murdered before the house, but the executioners led me towards the bridge. My idea at that time was, that they intended to drown me in the river. I made several attempts to speak, and told them a few plain and severe truths, the force of which they felt, and therefore did all they could to prevent my being heard. 'Do not let him speak,' was vociferated from the mob. 'Knock him down if he does not hold his tongue,' was often repeated; but whenever I had an opportunity, I made my voice heard. I asked them whether this was the country in which 'all men were born free and equal' in which 'the freedom of speech' was guaranteed to every one; and, also, whether this was their reward for my flying to arms, last Friday, in defence of the helpless of their wives, and of their children? I said I might have dreamed of such lawless proceedings in Portugal, where Miguel reigned over the most abject of slaves, but never in the country, and, more particularly, in the State, which gave birth to the author of the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. I was here interrupted by a low Irish blackguard, who boards at Mr. Horthorn's, with a 'don't let him spake, by Jasus.' I turned towards him, and in a voice of mixed contempt and pity, said, 'I thank you, sir.' These few words, or rather the tone in which I pronounced them, made the whole mob burst into a fit of laughter, and so much confused paddy, that he never after opened his mouth.On the bridge we met a PARSON returning from town after an early walk on the Richmond road. I will not say positively that the holy man had taken this promenade to witness what those who had been out to meet the coach intended to do to me; but this I know, that he passed me with a christian smile on his lips, and never thought it his duty to interfere or say one word in my behalf. My crime was enormous, it is true; for I had asserted the day before that the poor blacks were entitled to their freedom; whilst his Reverence no doubt thought, with the Rev. Newton, of Olney, (England,) that 'slavery was an appointment of Providence, respectable and profitable.' Be this as it may, the man of God passed me with as much unconcern as if I had been an ox led to the shambles, to glut his Christian appetite for 'raw flesh.' (1 Sam. ii. 15.)Three hundred yards from the bridge, some proposed that we should turn to the right, and pointed out a huge tree, 'which,' they said, 'would do very well.' We were moving towards it, when others opposed it, and expressed a wish that we should turn to the left, into a wood leading to a retired and beautiful spot, near a spring of water, with which I had often assuaged my thirst. I did not yet know what these sons of liberty intended to do with me, although I began to suspect that it was their intention to hang me to a tree, which was no doubt contemplated by some of them, as one had a rope, which I did not however see till we went towards the tree on the right side of the road. With this impression on my mind, but without any hope of changing their purpose, I told them that 'they might take my life, and, like some of the cannibals who disgraced the French revolution, they might even drink my blood. I could not die in a better cause.' 'Oh! no doubt,' said the fellow who had hold of my right arm, 'you are a fine man, and never did any hurt in your life; we are only going to make you atone for what evil you might have done!' 'Oh he'll never do more,' said another. 'Now you are out of Petersburg,' said Doctor Cox, 'we will prevent your ever returning.' 'Ah! so we will!' from twenty. 'Do what you please,' said I, 'you have physical power, use it as you please.' 'So we will,' was the answer.At last we arrived at the top of a small hill, shaded by trees, and this was the place fixed upon. Some of the savages pulled off my coat, others the rest of my clothes, except my shirt. I asked to be allowed to speak before they proceeded to extremities; and, though some opposed it, others insisted on my being heard, and these prevailed. Some said they had not come there to hear speeches, and if they had known it, they would not have lest their stores. 'What,' said I, 'will you condemn and punish me unheard?' 'Let him speak, let him speak;' and I spoke thus:'I admit that I had yesterday a conversation on the subject of slavery at Mr. Horthorn's. To prove that this conversation must have been misrepresented. I need only remind you of my readiness last Friday to go and meet men on whom I looked as murderers men who did not hesitate to shed the blood oh defenceless beings. But this also I stated, and still it to be an incontrovertible truth that black men have, in the abstract, A RIGHT TO THEIR FREEDOM. 'That's enough that's enough!' burst out from the herd; 'don't let him speak any more;' my shirt was torn off from my back. I crossed on my arms on my bosom, and waited, without adding another word, for the beginning of my martyrdom. A few exclaimed, 'don't strike too hard?That the request was not complied with, was probably not their fault; for when I had received a certain number of lashes, which they deemed sufficient atonement for my crime, they again cried out, 'enough!!' but could not prevent the blood-thirsty Cross the wretch who had dragged me all the way by my left arm, from giving me three or four more severe cuts across both my naked back and bosom. They were severe, and made me advance one or two steps; yet not a word of complaint was heard from me. It was with much difficulty that this monster in human shape was stopped indeed he proposed to fight some of those, who, more humane, wished to end my misery. I believe I got some friends by exclaiming, 'Gentlemen, do not fight on my account let him go on.' This I said with perfect singleness of heart. Tar had been brought, and now it was proposed by some to apply it on what they were pleased to term 'my big whiskers.' Another altercation followed, which, fortunately for me, terminate in favor of those who were for mercy. Never can I forget a young man who stood near me with my clothes in his hands, and who strongly opposed this intended cruelty. I saw grief and compassion written in his countenance, and I am glad I had an opportunity of shaking him by the hand as he handed me my clothes. I am not sure I know his name, although I believe it to be C.C.; but never can I forget his face, nor will ever my heart cease to remember the proofs of sympathy and kindness he gave me on this occasion.I was now allowed to dress, and ordered to take immediately the road to Richmond. A line was drawn with a stick, and I was told that if ever I passed that line, it would fare 'worser' with me.I took my departure, scarcely believing in my escape from these Virginian brigands; and, notwithstanding the soreness I felt all over my lacerated body, I walked on as fast as possible. The sun, which was in my back all the way, caused me to suffer excruciating pains. After marching 5 or 6 miles, my feet began also to feel sore, so that it was with difficulty I reached the half-way house. The landlord knew already part of my story, which had been related to him by the coachman, who drove the 8 o'clock coach. Here I learnt that a party of men, the same that passed me in Bolingbroke Street, had stopped the stage on the other side of the bridge, from Petersburg to Richmond; that they looked in, and not finding me, said, 'he is not here,' and ran back towards the town.The landlord advised me not to show my wounds to any one; but I assured him, that, far from being ashamed, I felt proud of them.An Irish gentleman, who had left Petersburg three quarters of an hour after me, told the landlord to admonish me to make the best of my way to Richmond, as many had expressed themselves displeased with the mildness of my punishment, and regretted I had not been put out of the way. He assured the landlord that they were so incensed, that he thought it very possible they might yet follow me. I begged of the landlord to furnish me with a horse, but he said he could not. He thought it very probable, however, that the landlord of the second half-way house, who, he said, was a very humane man, would, on hearing my story, lend me a mule or a horse. I called on him, but without success. Nothing now remained but to walk on as well as I could, with new boots on, and my feet all over blistered. I thought it unsafe to follow the road, and therefore took to the woods, endeavoring not to diverge too much from the course of the road.After sufferings which I cannot describe, but which may be conceived, when I state that both my big toes were swollen in a most frightful manner, and they are now (Saturday, Sept. 3d) in that state of inflammation which precedes mortification, I reached the Richmond rail-road, which passes a few yards from the Manchester bridge. It was my intention to avoid crossing this bridge, fearing that the Petersburg ruffians might have already paid a visit to Richmond for the purpose of raising a riot; which they might easily have done by representing me as a leader of the blacks. I crawled, for I could no longer walk, as far down as Rocket's, and there crossed in a small boat to the opposite side of the river. I went on board of the Effort, and heard with pleasure that she would leave Rocket's at 9 o'clock that evening for New York.I endeavored to procure a hackney coach to go up to town and see Mr. W., but could not get one. I made an effort to walk, but found it impossible to proceed more than a quarter of a mile, and I had at least one-mile more to go. I sat by the side of the road, not knowing what next to do, when a dray-cart passed by me; I called out to the driver to stop, and promised him 25 cents if he would carry me to Mr. W's house. It was so dark that the man could not see me, and, no doubt thinking my request strange, he asked me to pay him in advance, which I did, and got upon the dray. I found Mr. W. at home, who received me with the utmost kindness. He thought it best at first, that I should remain in Richmond, but on more mature consideration he approved of my plan to go to New York immediately. He went out for a hackney coach, and saw me on board the Effort, where I learnt with chagrin, that she would not leave before 9 next morning. Shook my kind friend by the hand, and groped my way as well as I could towards a berth, to which I was led in the dark by the mate.The narrator of the above, and the victim of the slaveholding desperadoes of Petersburg, (for to that place belongs the infamy of this proceeding) is now in this city, which he reached while yet unable to walk, from the effects of the treatment he received.

 The Petersburg Outrage. Since we published the account (on Saturday) of the outrage an outrage almost unparalleled in this country committed by a mob of gentlemen slavites in Petersburg, Va. against Mr. Robinson, who is now in this city, we have been informed that another gentleman from Petersburg has arrived, who confirms the truth of all that was said. In addition to the account of the treatment to which Mr. Robinson was subjected, and his being compelled, through fear of his life, to leave Petersburg without being enabled to obtain his baggage, we have now to state that Mr. Carter, the gentleman with whom Mr. R. boarded, and who in vain endeavored to keep the villains out of his own house and from executing their diabolical purpose, has been compelled to leave Petersburg precipitately, and abandon his store and business, although he had but lately obtained a new supply of goods from New York. We mention this not for the purpose of magnifying the offence of the slavites, for it is unnecessary to do that, but to show that in Petersburg, at least, for persons who dare to express their opinions on the subject of slavery in the south, even in the most harmless manner, the laws afford no protection, and the officers of the law, in contempt of their oaths and obligations, suffer them to be violated with impunity! Does not this show the very reverse of a disposition to lessen the evil of slavery? and is it not in vain for the people of the slaveholding states to tell us that they ought to be allowed to manage the slave question in their own way, while they prevent by outrage a discussion even of the means of lessening the evil complained of? As well might we be told that we ought not to sympathize with the heroic Poles who are struggling for their birthright that freedom which is alike dear to them and to the slaves of the United States, and that we ought not to speak of their rights or their means of obtaining them. The recent events show clearly that it is necessary for the people of the non-slaveholding states to interfere and save our country from the disgrace of adding to the horrors of slavery the crime of destroying hundreds upon hundreds of those who are only guilty of conspiring, as did the founders of our republic, to obtain their freedom. N.Y.

 The Oxford, N.C. Examiner states that Robert Potter is the Member of Congress who recently horribly maimed and mutilated a young man of 20, named Willie, and a Methodist minister named Lewis Taylor, aged 60, because jealous of his wife. He has been put upon trial, pleaded guilty, and sentenced in the first instance to pay $1000 fine, be imprisoned 6 months, and thereafter until the fine be paid. A crowd of spectators were much excited. The indictment for maiming the minister is to come on at the Spring term. The jealous fool could not produce a shadow of evidence of his wife's infidelity.Trumbull's Painting. New Haven papers state that Col. Trumbull has consented to place his celebrated pictures, eight of them historical pieces, in the charge of the College, to become at his decease the property of the College, on these conditions: Col. T. is to receive an annuity during his life, from the avails of the collection or other sources, and those avails after his decease, shall be appropriated to the education of indigent young men. Copies of these paintings are also placed in Hartford in charge of Trustees, for the same purpose of educating indigent students.Drowned. Two colored persons, named John Brothers and John Roxbury, of Philadelphia, both as we learn of respectable character, were drowned yesterday in our harbor, by the upsetting of a sail boat. Two Sandwich Islanders were also in the boat at the time it was upset, but by their well known expertness at swimming were enabled to escape the fate of the other two. New Bedford Register Sept. 21.To prevent Explosion of a Steam Boiler. A correspondent of the Staffordshire Advertiser says, 'I notice the dreadful explosion of a steam boiler at Liverpool.

About 12 months ago I tried to burst a steam engine boiler, used for winding up coal, but did not effect it; the surety plate gradually became thinner as the heat and elasticity increased, swelled into a hemisphere and then tore asunder without any fragments, letting off the steam with a loud but harmless explosion.'The source of Pauperism. By the returns this year from the indefatigable Medical Board of the Dexter Asylum in Providence, we have the melancholy and striking fact, fully authenticated, that, out of 126 adults admitted to the Asylum the past year, who have come under the observation of the attending physicians, ninety-eight were intemperate persons, being five sixths of all the adults, who have been directly reduced to poverty and disease, by the use of ardent spirits!In a conversation a few days since with one of the Constables of the City of Boston, he observed, that he was obliged to leave Boston to seek employment, 'that since the late law which forbids imprisonment for all debts under ten dollars, and prohibits all precepts against females for debt, his business had fallen off from $1400 to $300 a year.' Lynn Record.The Spirit of the Age. The sturdy Englishman, in his country house; the volatile Frenchman, in his faux-bourgs; the irascible Fleming, in his corn fields; the lion-hearted Pole, on the Vistula; all, all are looking in one direction, seeking, in one way or another, one object the rights and privileges of the people. Metropolitan, for August.Among the petitions that will be presented to Congress at the next session, those for abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia ought to claim, and probably will receive, serious attention.

          THIS Society was formed in the United States, in 1817.Its 13th Annual Report has just reached this country.Its object, as expressed by itself, (see 13th Report, page 41, app. 9, art. 2,) Is to promote and execute a plan for colonizing the free people of colour, residing in 'the United States' in Africa, or such other place as Congress shall deem most expedient. The facts of the case are these:1. That the United States have about 2,000,000 enslaved blacks. 2. That they have about 500,000 free blacks. 3. That both these classes are rapidly increasing. 4. That both are exceedingly depressed and degraded.The duty of the United States to them, is the same exactly as we owe to our coloured fellow-subjects in our slave colonies, viz. to obey God, by letting them go free, by placing them beneath wise and equitable laws, and by loving them all, and treating them like brethren; that is to say, the unquestionable duty of the people of the United States is to emancipate their 2,000,000 slaves, and to raise the 500,000 free coloured people to that estimation in their native country which is due to them.But the American Colonization Society deliberately rejects both of these first great duties, and confines itself to the colonization in Africa of the free coloured people. They say, in page 5, of their 13th Report, To abolition she could not look and need not look, It could do nothing in the slave states for the cause of humanity; and in page 8, Emancipation, with the liberty to remain on this side of the Atlantic, is but an act of dreamy madness.Now in thus deliberately letting the great crime of Negro slavery alone; and in thus substituting a little restricted act of very dubious benevolence to a few, for the great and sacred duty of right which they owe to all, they hurt the great cause of everlasting truth and love, in the following particulars:1. By offering to the nation a hope, at which many of their best men seem eagerly grasping, of getting rid of the coloured people abroad they conduce more and more, as this hope prevails, to keep out of mind the superior, unalterable, and immediate duty of righting them at home.2. By removing whatever number it be, from their native country, the number which remains must be diminished, and the more the number which remains is diminished, the more helpless will they become the less will be the hope of their ever recovering their own liberty and the more and the longer will they be trampled upon.3. The more the people of the United States (and this is equally true of Great Britain) substitute a half-way duty, difficult, expensive, and partial as it must be, and criminal as it unquestionably is for the whole duty which they owe their Negro fellow-subjects, of putting them, before the law, upon a par with themselves the less will they be likely to feel their sin in continuing to wrong them; and the less they feel their sin, the less likely will they be to repent of it, and to do their duty.4. The greater the number of slaves transported, the greater will be the value of the labour of those who remain; the more valuable their labour is, the greater will be the temptation to over-labour them, and the more, of course, they will be oppressed.5. The American Colonization Society directly supports the false and cruel idea that the native country of the coloured people of the United States, is not their native country, and that they never can be happy until they either exile themselves, or are exiled; and thus powerfully conduces to extinguish in them all those delightful hopes, and to prevent all that glorious exertion, which would make them a blessing to their country. In this particular, the American Colonization Society takes up a falsehood, as cruel to the coloured people, as it is disgraceful to themselves; dwells upon it, as if it were an irrefragable truth; urges it, as such, upon others; and thus endeavours with all its force, to make that practically true, which is one of the greatest stains in the American character; which is one of the greatest scourges that could possibly afflict the free coloured people; and which, in itself, is essentially and unalterably false. For be the pertinacity of prejudice what it may, in asserting that the blacks of America never can be amalgamated in all respects, in equal brotherhood with the whites, it will not the less remain an everlasting truth, that the wickedness which produced and perpetuates the assertion, is the only ground of the difficulty, and that all that is requisite to remove the whole evil, is the relenting in love of the proud and cruel spirit which produced it. Could the American Colonization Society succeed in establishing their views on this subject, as being really true of the people of the United States, it would only prove that the people of the United States were past repentance; that they were given over, through their obstinacy in sin, finally to believe a lie; to harden themselves, and to perish in their iniquity. But they have not succeeded in establishing this fearful fact against themselves; and as long as they continue capable of repentance, it never can be true, that the proud and baneful prejudices which now so cruelly alienate them from their coloured brethren, may not, will not, must not, yield to the sword of the Spirit, to the Word of God, to the blessed weapons of truth and love.The American Colonization Society is beautiful and beneficial as far as it supports the cause commenced at Sierra Leone, by introducing into Africa, civilization, commerce, and genuine christianity by checking the African Slave Trade and by serving in love the emigrants who choose to pass to Liberia.But it powerfully tends to veil the existing and outrageous atrocity of Negro Slavery; and it corroborates against the people of colour, whether enslaved or free, one of the most base, groundless, and cruel prejudices, that has ever disgraced the powerful, or afflicted the weak.The following calculations may throw further light upon the subject.The United States have about 2,000,000 slaves, and about 500,000 free coloured people.The American Colonization Society has existed for 13 years, and has exported yearly, upon an average, about 150 persons.Meanwhile the natural yearly increase has been 56,000 souls; and nearly a million have died in slavery!!But it may be said this is only the beginning more may be expected hereafter. Let us see.The average price of transporting each individual is calculated at 30 dollars: suppose it to be reduced to 20, and then, as 56,000 must be exported yearly, in order, merely to prevent increase, 1,120,000 dollars would be yearly requisite simply for transportation. Where is this vast sum to come from? Or suppose it supplied, still, in the mass of crime and wretchedness, as it now exists, there would be no decrease!  Two millions of human beings every 30 years would still be born and die in Slavery!!But perhaps you wish to extinguish the crime in thirty years.Then you must begin by transporting at least 100,000 yearly. In order to do this, you must have an annual income of upwards of 2,000,000 dollars; and if you have not only to transport, but also to purchase, you would probably want yearly, twenty millions more!!Where are you to get this?Or suppose it got, and still one generation would perish in their wretchedness; 2,000,000 of immortal souls plundered by you of the most sacred rights of human nature; of rights always the same, and everlastingly inalienable, however plundered would have perished unredressed, and gone to confront you at the bar of God.And will He not make inquisition for blood? And what will it avail you to say, Oh, we satisfied ourselves, and traversed land and sea, and spent thousands to satisfy others, that if we transported a few hundreds or thousands of our oppressed fellow-subjects to a distant country, yearly, with care, we might guiltlessly leave the remaining hundreds of thousands, or the millions, in slavery, and harmlessly indulge the invincible repugnance which we felt to a coloured skin. We really thought it better, to exile our coloured brethren from their native country, or to render their lives in it, intolerable by scorn, should they obstinately persist in remaining in it; we really thought this better, than humbling ourselves before our brother and our God, and returning to both with repenting and undissembling love.Is not such language similar to the swearer's prayer!!Great Britain and the United States, the two most favoured, and the two most guilty nations upon earth, both need rebuke. They ought to be brethren, mutually dear and honourable to each other, in all that is true and kind. But never, never, let them support one another in guilt.People of Great Britain, it is your business it is your duty, to give negro slavery no rest, but to put it down not by letting the trunk alone, while you idly busy yourselves in lopping off, or in aiding others to lop off, a few of the straggling branches but by laying the axe at once to its roots, and by putting your united nerve into the steel, till this great poison tree of lust and blood, and of all abominable and heartless iniquity, fall before you; and law and love, and God and man, shout victory over its ruin.Hearken thus saith the Lord, Rob not the poor, because he is poor; neither oppress the afflicted in the gate. For the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. Prov. xxii. 22, 23.London, July 15, 1831.                   half-way whole     that practically true, never                 no decrease!  born die     twenty millions     always the same, inalienable, unredressed,         your duty,     London, July    C.

         We learn by the Fayetteville Observer, that Nat, the reputed leader in the Virginia insurrection, has been arrested and is now in jail. He is said to deny having any such object as is imputed to him. The Governor of Virginia offered $500 for his detection. In a description of his person, Nat is represented to have 'a scar on one of his temples, also one on the back of his neck, and a large knot on one of the bones of his right arm, near the wrist, produced by a blow.' Why should we wonder at his determined efforts to revenge his wrongs and obtain his liberty? Such treatment as he received at the hands of his tyrannical owner was calculated to feed his wrath and bring a dreadful retaliation. But his wrongs will avail nothing before his merciless judges. Although he deserves a portion of the applause which has been so prodigally heaped upon Washington, Bolivar, and other heroes, for the same rebellious though more successful conduct, yet he will be torn to pieces and his memory cursed!To illustrate the insecurity of the south and the awful disquietude which prevails among the inhabitants, we copy the confession of the Fayetteville Observer:'We cannot help being astonished at the effects of the reports abroad. Women and children is several of the counties have fled to the swamps, from which, after a day or two, they emerged, wet, muddy, and half starved. Wagoners, who were on their way to Fayetteville, have discharged their loads at some house on the road and returned home. Thousands of the militia have assembled in arms, even in the upper counties, which might have been supposed beyond the reach of danger,' &c.  heroes,        

       Revivals of religion are indispensable to sanctify the literature of the nation, and to associate intellectual culture with holiness of heart. In all our systems of education, from the common school up to the college, these have been dissociated. The care of the heart, if any care was bestowed upon it, has been turned over to the nursery, while the intellect and the memory have been sent to school to receive a separate education. The result has been such as might have been expected. The depravity of the heart, unwatched, unresisted, and, in some respects, deliberately fostered, has made fearful proficiency in the government and perversion of the understanding.

 The reports, published last week, of the burning of Wilmington and the slaughter of seventeen families in North Carolina, prove to be fabrications.

From the Patriot of Thursday. From the Patriot of Thursday.   THE CONSPIRACY AT WILMINGTON. We have been favored with the following extracts of a letter, dated'Wilmington, N.C. Sept. 20. In my last I mentioned to you that we had been under a very great excitement here, in consequence of an expected insurrection among our blacks. It appears on investigation, that the plot was much deeper laid than we had anticipated. A number of desperate fellows in Sampson and Duplin had communicated with a number of blacks of this town, viz. Nimrod Usher, Old Dan the drayman, a fellow named Prince, and one Abraham, are deeply concerned in the plot.'The leaders in Sampson, with their men, were to meet the party from Wilmington at the Little Bridge at midnight, to march into town in four squads; to fire the town in four different places, and massacre the white men, women and children. The leaders in this plot have all been executed Nimrod, Dan, Prince and Abraham were all shot this morning at 6 o'clock on Gallows Hill, and THEIR HEADS ARE NOW STICKING ON POLES AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE TOWN. I am happy to say the excitement has entirely subsided, and we shall probably have nothing to fear for twenty years to come.''We shall probably have nothing to fear for twenty years to come!' What complacency! what calculation! The savage cruelty of the whites will but what the appetites and increase the fury of the slaves. The security of southern planters is at an end.

 The report of a murder of a family in Dinwiddie Co. Va. by slaves, is positively contradicted in the Petersburg Intelligencer.      

 The whole number of lives, sacrificed in this horrid tragedy, is about 110 or 112. Sixty four whites were massacred about 30 or 35 blacks, it is estimated, were shot down by the troops called out to quell the insurrection; one militiaman was killed in a re-encounter, and twelve, probably ere this, have been executed.In addition to the above, between 30 and 40 slaves have been examined in Nansemond county, and one sentenced to death. He had been present at a meeting of the blacks, at which a black preacher had called upon all who were willing to join the conspiracy to hold up their hands. This fellow was proved to be one of those who had thus signified his determination to join the insurgents.It is stated that 8 or 9 convictions have taken place in the county of Sussex, and that a black preacher, by trade, a blacksmith, in Prince George county, has been condemned. Richmond Tel.

 It is said a conspiracy among the blacks has been discovered in the county of Sussex, Delaware. Twenty-four of the prominent participators in it have been arrested and are now in prison. Apprehensions are also entertained for the quiet of Kent county in the vicinity of Dover. Patrols walk the streets nightly to prevent surprise, and many of the inhabitants continue in a state of much excitement and alarm.      

 Three slaves have been condemned to death in Spotsylvania Co. Va. one the property of Mrs. Stevens, upon a charge of burglary one the property of Col. R. Crutchfield, upon a charge of consulting and conspiring to make an insurrection and one the property of Mr. R. Coleman, for killing a woman and two boys.      

 Virginia Insurrection A letter from a young gentleman in Virginia to his parents, in New Hampshire, appears in the last number of the Haverhill (New Hampshire) Post. It details some of the horrible excesses to which the blacks proceeded, and the still more horrid acts of cruelty perpetrated by the whites, in bringing about a lawless, self-exercised retribution. The writer says, that in one instance in Southampton county, sixteen entire families were destroyed with the exception of two fathers, who went from home, and one mother, who, after seeing her children's brains beat out, and her husband mortally wounded, fled, hid herself and escaped, and one other father, who, when his family were attacked, left wife and children, hid himself in the current bushes in the garden, lay there and saw his whole family murdered in the yard within two yards of him! From the sad effects of his witnessing this awful scene, has ensued raving madness. It is truly revolting to learn, that without trial in some instances without the shadow of suspicion innocent colored persons were sacrificed without mercy, to the excited passion and inconsiderate revenge of the whites in pursuit. One negro, we are informed, 'was sent on horseback, upon an errand to the next neighbor's, and commanded to go quick while he was riding along rather fast, a company of soldiers, supposing him an enemy fleeing, let in a whole volley upon him, and killed both man and horse. Another was taken alive, and put to death by torture. THEY BURNT HIM WITH RED HOT IRONS CUT OFF HIS EARS AND NOSE STABBED HIM, CUT HIS HAMSTRINGS, STUCK HIM LIKE A HOG, AND AT LAST CUT OFF HIS HEAD, AND SPIKED IT TO THE WHIPPING POST for a spectacle and a warning to the other negroes!' This is barbarous cruelty; unworthy the age in which we live. The poor blacks were but struggling for liberty and though laboring desperately to effect their object, the fact ought to be taken into consideration. We really hope that the recent occurrence of a sanguinary insurrection may have the beneficial effect of opening the eyes of the people of the south, to the propriety or expediency of taking some measures to abolish slavery from that portion of the United States. In the present example, we have seen that the spirit of rebellion is formidable and this is the more evident, from the fact that the insurgents had little chance of success. Hartford Mirror.

       The Editor of the Boston Christian Herald has obligingly permitted us to publish the following letter in anticipation of its entire publication in his own paper. O, the fiendish cruelty it discloses!     WALTHAM, Sept. 24th, 1831.   Mr. Greene:SIR Having noticed several sketches of the insurrection in Virginia, I feel a little disposed to narrate a few circumstances connected with that event. At the time it took place, I was in Norfolk, and afterwards at Richmond, and other parts of the State. The alarm and agitation were truly great; and in the countenance of every white man, nothing was depicted but fear and dismay. The Governor immediately summoned the white population to assemble, and to be furnished with arms and ammunition from the public magazines. In a passage up James River, I went on shore several times, and visited the plantations, and witnessed the uneasiness prevailing among the owners or overseers. At Charles County City, a resident informed me that in the neighborhood there were not more than 20 whites, while on four plantations in the vicinity there were 200 blacks, who, if so inclined, said he, might destroy us all, even if they were but armed with clubs. They had just apprehended a black preacher, who came down from Richmond to preach in an old meeting-house near that place. At Richmond, the whites were heard cursing the Quakers or Baptists, whom they declared would ruin the State. I FREQUENTLY HEARD IT WISHED THAT THE D ----- D NEGROES MIGHT ALL BE EXTERMINATED. Never were a people so heartily sick of slaves, yet not disposed to liberate them. In riding in the stage from Richmond to Fredericksburg, a passenger by the name of Smith, direct from the seat of the insurrection, stated that the blacks who were taken prisoners were killed in the most barbarous manner.Their noses and ears were cut off, the flesh of their cheeks cut out, their jaws broken asunder, and then set up as a mark to shoot at!!! If a black was found out of doors, after dark, without a pass, he would be immediately shot down.It appears that the negro children had been taught to repeat that the British, or some other foe, were coming to Virginia to massacre all the white people: for some time before the insurrection, they had often been overheard repeating such a story to each other. Many blacks not particularly concerned in the rebellion, and living quite remote from the scene, have been apprehended for uttering similar predictions. I should think from all the information I obtained, that no doubt could exist but that a deep plot was laid for a general massacre of the whites. The stage passenger alluded to, mentioned that the slaves commenced an attack one week too soon, owing to some miscalculation. This circumstance I have seen corroborated by other accounts.In August, extensive revivals of religion were prevailing, in the Baptist churches, at Norfolk and Richmond. At the latter place, on the Sabbath evening of the 28th, several officers of the city entered their meeting and dispersed the congregation. Several whites were summoned to appear at court that week, to answer for countenancing unlawful meetings of slaves. It appears that the laws of Virginia do not allow the blacks to attend any evening or night meetings; but before the insurrection, they had been allowed the practice as a privilege. Since that tragical event, this law has been put into strict force. No black is now allowed to be out after 8 o'clock, without a pass, and then not, at a religious meeting. While at Richmond, a camp meeting was held about 8 miles from the city. The blacks bad heretofore attended, but at this they were forbidden. The denial of such accustomed privileges must prove very galling to them, and I should not be surprised to hear of oft repeated attempts to throw off the chains of servitude and slavery.This visit of mine was the first to a slaveholding state under our own government. I had twice been at Cuba, where I saw slave ships almost daily arriving, with their full cargoes of human beings. I had seen them sold, whipped and worked like horses or oxen, but then it was by a savage race of beings, under a despotic government. But under the mild influences of a free and independent republic, we should expect better things. But at Norfolk and Richmond are agents advertising and purchasing negroes for the Orleans or Cuba market. And throughout Virginia are hundreds of whites who make it a part, if not their whole business, to rear negroes as they would cattle for the market. And the Planters pretend that this is the only produce that will pay them at any profit. To a Northerner or a Yankee, the face of this country looks miserable enough indeed. You may ride a whole day and meet with no pleasant villages with their towering spires, or well cultivated fields and orchards, the ornament and delight of a New-England journey. But here are extensive plantations of tobacco, corn, &c. with a few miserable log huts peopled with a host of dirty and ragged negroes with their naked children, wallowing on the ground floor, with their no more brutish company of dogs and hogs. I often remarked, that I thought it strange that the negro huts should be placed so near the road, when the owner's situation was generally so hidden, and remote. But in Virginia, abundance of negroes is a white man's pride. Wherever you see a fine house with a garden attached to it, you will see the yard mostly filled up with huts, negroes, and hogs. I very soon became disgusted with so much filth and wretchedness, and sighed to see a return of accustomed cleanliness, comfort and liberty, which a yankee, by witnessing the scenes I have described, will relish with a most delightful zest.  Mr. Greene:   yet not disposed to liberate them.   noses ears were cut off, the flesh of their cheeks cut out, jaws broken asunder, set up as a mark to shoot at!!! shot down.       produce Northerner Yankee,    S.B.

                 An anti-colonization voice greets us from across the Atlantic! We refer our readers to the preceding page, for a Circular put forth in England, by a distinguished friend of the abolition cause. It is drawn up in a wonderfully comprehensive and cogent manner, and must produce an electrifying effect in this country. May the blessings of those who are ready to perish rest upon its benevolent author!It is generally known that, early last Spring, the Colonization Society deputed Elliot Cresson, of Philadelphia, a member of the Society of Friends, to visit England and dupe the philanthropists of that country by begging of them money to forward its anti-christian crusade against our free colored population. He went, with prejudice in his heart, and defamation and dishonor on his lips! He went, to the lasting disgrace of the nation, to tell the pitiful story, that the blacks ought not to enjoy their inalienable rights in this their native country; that the slaves ought never to be liberated but by a slow process; that here they must not remain; that the prejudices of the people were incurable; and to stigmatize those as madmen and fanatics, who are contending for the immediate overthrow of slavery! Fine doctrines to be retailed in England, where the people are lifting up their voices, in a tone that shakes every Colony to its centre, and putting forth their united efforts for the instant and entire emancipation of all British slaves! Fine doctrines to be preached by a citizen of a democratic republic to the upholders of a monarchical government especially to be preached by a Quaker! (fortunately he is a poor specimen of Quakerism.) Well, how has he been received? Read the eloquent Circular for a reply read the following extract of a letter from a highly esteemed friend in London, dated July 23, 1831:'The Colonization Society has sent out to this country Mr. Elliot Cresson, of Philadelphia, as their agent to solicit funds. I rejoice to be able to write you that Cresson has met with determined opposition from the staunch friends of the cause in this city. They abhor the crusade against color and the base deification of an unholy prejudice. The enclosed Circular has been published by a distinguished friend to Abolition, formerly in the service of the East India Company Capt. C. Stuart. It has put Cresson into a rage, and I have no doubt he will give to the English public some of his Society's trumpery arguments. Be it so let the subject be fairly discussed, and the injustice of the Colonization plan will be quickly made to appear.'Cresson has been challenged to give forth some of his arguments on Thursday next, in Peck Lane, one of the suburbs of this great metropolis, where are many staunch friends of abolition, immediate and total. I shall be present, in company with Capt. Stuart.'If we had room, we would occupy many columns on this subject. We must defer our remarks to future numbers. We shall strike off Capt. Stuart's Exposition on a letter sheet, with a few introductory remarks of our own, at $2 per hundred. Many thousand copies ought to be circulated wherever the colonization influence is felt. Orders promptly attended to.             

       What is the object of the hue-and-cry against the Liberator? Why, on the part of the slavites, exclusively this they no more believe the paper has had the least connexion with the late insurrections than we believe they are honest and humane men; but they expect to impose upon the people of the free States, by withdrawing their attention from the barbarous system of slavery, and fixing it upon another and an innocent object. They are fearful of the tide of public indignation, taking its rise from the northern and eastern extremities of our country, may roll onward to the south, and, dashing over the Alleghany mountains, tear up the deep foundations of oppression. Now, if they can hide their own depraved conduct, and crush the Liberator which is exposing their wickedness, they imagine themselves secure. But the people cannot be deceived; the Liberator shall live; and tyrants never can he safe.Some leading Colonizationists are endeavoring to destroy us by false accusations and gross misrepresentations. They dislike to see their machinations exposed; they do not mean to surrender their prejudices; and they are resolved to justify and support the slavites in holding two millions of human beings in bondage.Amid this uproar and opposition, we remain unmoved, nor shall threats or daggers make us swerve the breadth of a hair from our purpose. Martyrdom we neither court nor shun. We have dedicated our life to the cause of emancipation. Our voice is not to be suppressed by penal enactments. Of the blood which has been shed, our hands are clean: slave owners and their apologists are answerable for it.         

       The account of the treatment of a white gentleman in Virginia, published on our first page from the New-York Daily Sentinel, is a disgrace to civilization. It is, too, an awful commentary upon the condition of the south.The narrator, it appears by the tenor of his disclosures, is not a believer in christianity, and consequently he sneers at its professors. They richly merit those sneers, who are slave owners. The church, in the slave states, is full of all uncleanness, and red with innocent blood. Its rulers and members constantly trade in the souls of men. Ministers and people, with a few exceptions, alike steal and murder, and will alike go down to hell and to the blackness of darkness forever, unless they speedily repent.The fact must now be self-evident to the dullest observer, that the lives of the planters are in imminent peril and they know it. Their refuges of lies are swept away, behind which they have so long and so successfully taken shelter. The words 'Freedom,' 'Equal Rights,' 'ALL MEN ARE BORN EQUAL,' if uttered in the presence of a slave, turn their cheeks pale, and cause a trembling through all their joints. Not one of them rests easy upon his pillow at night dismay is universal. So unrelenting, indeed, is their tyranny, and so excessive their terror, that many of them openly advocate the expediency of putting the whole black population to the sword!! This bloody proposition is supported even by females!The Indians of North America were never more savage, blood-thirsty and revengeful, than are southern slaveholders, as a body. Look at the letter copied into our Slavery Record that will sustain our assertion. Acts of barbarity are there recorded, which exhibit the ferocity of tigers. Yet we owe their development to the accidental sojourn of a New-England man in that quarter! How many more of a similar tragic character have been committed,'No eye may search no tongue may challenge or reveal!'      and they know it. females!        

 A riot, unequalled in New England for its desperate features, occurred at Providence on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday evenings of last week, between some whites and blacks the former having given the provocation. About a dozen houses, occupied for dissolute purposes by the latter, were torn down, and their contents scattered to the winds. A sailor, who was in the mob, was shot on Wednesday evening by some colored person or persons, and died instantly. On Saturday evening, the mob increasing in number, and refusing to disperse, the Governor ordered the troops to fire upon them! Four persons were killed, and about fourteen wounded. A town meeting was held on the Sabbath, when resolutions were passed deprecating the conduct of the mob, and approving of the forbearance, moderation, and firmness of the civil and military authorities, and sanctioning the performance of the melancholy duty which at last devolved upon them.We shall publish the particulars of this riot, which have been sent to us by a friend in Providence, in our next paper.

       A highly intelligent and pious colored man is now in this city, for the purpose of obtaining the charities of our citizens, wherewith to purchase the freedom of his three children who are now in slavery. His name is John Gustive, By the liberality of individuals in other places, he has been enabled to ransom himself, his wife and eldest daughter. A little more than $800 remain to be collected, for the purpose above specified. This sum, we trust, will be obtained without difficulty. It involves the present and eternal welfare of three poor children, who are as dear to their unfortunate parents as ours are to us, and who must be torn from their arms if the money be not speedily raised.     

 A good opportunity to obtain instruction is now presented to those of our colored youth in this city, who desire to make intelligent and useful men and women. We can recommend the gentleman who advertises a school in our paper, as a good teacher and one who feels a deep interest in the improvement of the colored population.      

 THE ESSAYIST. This little semi-monthly sheet has grown to the dignity of a monthly magazine, No. 1 of which is on our table. It is conducted by George W. Light, an intelligent and estimable individual, and contains 32 pages octavo, at the low price of $2 per annum. We hope it will receive, what we venture to predict it will deserve, substantial patronage. The contents of the present number are Introduction; Living American Literature; the Star of the Soul; Picture of the Gay World: To Autumn; Travelling in the West; the Polish Standards; Life in Town and Country; Etymologies; Essayist Room. We have no space for criticism.      

     For the Liberator. For the Liberator.            Land of our birth! when Freedom rose, Waked from her sleep of years,She bade thee triumph o'er thy foes, And banish all thy fears,Then pointing to Religion's shrine, Her sons she bade repair,To make her service all divine, With their holy worship there.              High was the call, from Heaven it came, Borne on the wings of Time,Announced with-thunder and with flame, In accents all sublime.For Freedom's is a sacred voice, Which they who love shall hear;She bids her children all rejoice, And the mandate they revere.              She gave the word, her sons obeyed; Swift did they rush around;The Indian started from his shade, And listened to the sound.Long years the battle cry prevailed, Yet firm they stood the tide,Till the bright star of Hope was hailed, And they triumphed, though they died.              Land of our birth! thy glory's fame Shines in its bright array;Devotion shall increase the flame, And virtue smile to-day.The light of Freedom's star is pale; Without Religion's beamHer boasted pleasures all must fail, Like the pageants of a dream.              On! be the word, till Honor shines; On! until all are free!Till Afric's sons shall plant her vines, In Christian liberty.The star of Hope has lit the morn, Its rays shall bless our eyes,Till Virtue's power the world adorn, With the freedom of the skies.              God of the throned realm of Heaven! Thou canst our way direct;Oh, come through shadows morn and even, To lead us and protect.Be thou our nation's Guardian Power, Our strength in time of peace;And when the cloud of war shall lower, May thy mercy still increase.            L.     

       Our Father, our Father the Lord of the whole! Our little hearts flutter and pray,Sincerely as creatures who boast of a soul;But who, o'er the weakest would madly control, From the golden-haired youth to the grey.Our Father, our Father, who stretchest thy wing Supreme and eternal o'er allThe pinion of which is the chords of thy loveWe pray for the pheasant, the eaglet and dove; We pray for the worms that do crawl.Our Father, our Father we pray for the lark, The robin, the red bird, and bee;And, though black is its plumage we pray for the crow;For its heart thou hast fashioned like others we know; And the black and the white live in thee.Our Father, our Father for vultures we pray, Those ravenous birds of the glen;For they are our mates in the kingdom of wings;And the parrot that prates, and the locust that sings, To thee are as dear as the wren.Our Father, our Father we pray for the race Of each bird, and each beast, and each bee;Each fish, and each reptile that crawls on the earthAnd for Man! though the lord of all these from his birth, We pray for they all sprang from thee!                                 

         The indifference of our generation to the moral character of candidates for public office, is another evil of awful portent. We have no right to ask our public servants to profess our creed; but it is our duty to insist that they should conform their conduct to the laws of morality and virtue. The elevation of dissolute men to the highest posts in our government, is as little creditable to our wisdom, as to our moral sentiment. Who would entrust the control of his pecuniary affairs to a notorious swindler, or the education of his daughters to a woman of doubtful reputation? and yet, we have seen the highest interests of our nation sometimes entrusted to the care of men against whom the grossest violations of morality have been publicly alleged. I fear that we do not exercise so much vigilance in the selection of our highest magistrates, as we do in the choice of those of a subordinate character. We sometimes witness a degree of caution in the selection of a Treasurer to a humble corporation, or a town, which is seldom displayed in the employment of persons to fill the first places of government. And why is it? Can any other reason be given for such stupid indifference than the senseless party prejudices which are permitted to delude us; and the culpable surrender of our own judgments to the control of a petty aristocracy of political partizans? Excluded from all personal intercourse with candidates for elevated office, we allow those who hold or want their patronage, to deceive us into a base subservience to their own selfish purposes.Indeed we appear to recognise two distinct codes of morality. That by which we judge the poor, industrious common people, bears the mark of a christian origin; that intended for the opulent and elevated, shows a strong resemblance to Mahometanism. A 'well born' gentleman may defraud his creditors, (which a mussulman might not do,) insult society with his debaucheries, and patronize every mendicant black-leg that has been spewed upon our shore; and if he wants to become our governor or represent us in our national councils, presses enough may be found that are made to chime the praises of his patriotism, and every grog shop in the state will echo his greatness. Your neighbor and fellow citizen whom you have known intimately from his youth, who is bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh, whose family is maintained by honest industry and judicious frugality, whose children are the pride of your schools and the ornament of your church; the head of such a family, with ten times the talent and intelligence of the princely profligate, must not even be named in competition with him, because, forsooth, he is one of 'the better sort of folks,' and belongs to the 'upper class of society.' The smallest defect in the character, manners, or education of the plain common citizen is known to every one, and animadverted on with severity; but our nabob is never approached except when stuffed and padded for show; and then the elegance of his person, the dignity of his deportment, or the grace of his manners, atone for all his moral disqualifications. Distant as we are from Europe, and different as are our political institutions in form, from those whose oppression has so long degraded our fellow men there; so deeply have we become contaminated with her sentiments, usages and fashions, in the various departments of social life, and so all-controlling are the social relations upon our political affairs, that the chance for virtue and patriotism to become honored and respected in our Republic, is little better than in her monarchical courts.  insist   christian in form, social life,    Whitcomb's Address at Dedham.
