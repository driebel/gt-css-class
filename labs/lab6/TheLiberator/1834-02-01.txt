 PRESIDENT LORD. It is an imposition upon public credulity, and real injustice to the anti-slavery cause, for the colonization papers to rank this gentleman among abolitionists, and then to infer that there is a division in their ranks. Who is Nathan Lord? Who has heard of any peculiar interest which he has felt or manifested on the subject of slavery, until within a few weeks? And what has he brought forth? Why, a long half-and-half Letter to the editor of the New-Hampshire Observer, in which he talks of 'intemperate journalists,' and discourses upon the wrongs and sufferings of two and a half millions of American people as 'philosophically' and coolly as if he were discussing the merits of an apple-pudding. How he came to be put upon the list of the officers of the American Anti-Slavery Society, we know not. That there has been a great mistake committed is evident. As a specimen of his abolitionism, this gentleman lately refused to give publicity to a notice stating that an anti-slavery address would be delivered in Hanover giving the grave and weighty reason, for objecting to do so, that more harm than good would probably be done by the address, inasmuch as there was no public sentiment at Hanover to sustain such a movement!     

       Mr. Secretary Gurley read the annual report of the Managers:'It develops a state of affairs not quite so cheering as on some former years, owing to the unusual mortality among the last emigrants, and the vehement attacks of the abolitionists.'What a development is here! Notwithstanding the horrible mortality which has prevailed among the emigrants to Liberia in preceding years, it seems that an 'UNUSUAL' destruction took place among them last year! O, the poor slaughtered exiles! their blood cries from the ground!Ever since there has been any systematic opposition to the Colonization Society, it has been affirmed by its partisans that it has only increased the popularity and resources of the Society. Now there is a different story 'not quite so cheering' to the persecutors and oppressors. 'What have abolitionists done?' Put a debt of FORTY-SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS upon the Society, and at last extorted the confession that its prospects are 'not quite so cheering' that's something! They are doing more and more, every hour, to help the Society forward ----- to its ruin!    owing to the unusual mortality among the last emigrants, and the vehement attacks of the abolitionists.'        

         Philadelphia is at present the grand focus of philanthropy, agitation, and no small portion of humbug and cant. From every quarter, Emancipationists, Colonizationists, &c. &c., have come to our quiet city, to go through their respective roles, and do their best, either for good or evil, as the result will show. Messrs. Garrison, Tappan, Whittier, and others, have held a Convention, and have duly astonished the walls of the Adelphi, and of the Tabernacle, with a development of their wild and visionary schemes. They have now stopped for breath, and for time to prepare their address to the benighted people of this Union; an address, which, it is currently reported, will set the Potomac on fire, and prevail upon every slaveholder, south of Mason and Dixon's line, to release his sable thrall, and offer his throat meekly to the knife of the semi-savage, maddened with the possession of the liberty he is incapable of appreciating or comprehending.We have also the rational Colonizationist, who would drain off the black population gradually; and send them, when sufficiently enlightened, to plant a new Carthage on the shores of Western Africa. He hopes to destroy the slave-trade, carry christianity through the most benighted quarters of the globe, and extend commerce and civilization to the very gates of Timbuctoo.The third class is headed by the Rev. Mr. May, whose name has reached us by means of the Eastern newspapers, and who has been reviled as an amalgamationist. Mr. May is at present in the city, and held forth to a very large auditory, on Tuesday evening, at the Musical Fund Hall. His chief object is the amelioration of the condition of the blacks of the Union; or what is disrespectfully termed 'Prudy Crandallism.' He would have them educated to the level of the whites, taught reputable trades, which would inspire them with emulation to pursue the paths of improvement, and would finally, when they are capable of it, give them all the political privileges of the whites. This is the amalgamation scheme, which it is proposed to carry still further, by promoting, or at least not opposing, a 'more perfect union,' which intermarriage would ensure. A few generations, it is said, would destroy the characteristic feature of the obnoxious race, and then all would live in 'peace and harmony, and seldom ever fight,' as the old song has it.The amalgamation scheme is the queerest and most hopeless of all the schemes put forth in this scheming age. It cannot crawl at all by itself and will branch off at certain stages into either one or the other of the aforesaid propositions. When the blacks are educated sufficiently to be rational, they will follow the Colonization Society's recommendations, and when they take fancies for standing on an equality with the whites, Garrison has the red banner flying, and under that they will range themselves.Thus runs the world away. 'There can be no proposition,' saith a modern statesman, 'how ridiculous soever, if it be only pressed with some talent and sufficient fiery zeal, that will not find proselytes enough, ready to go to all extremes.' We are too happy. There must be a certain portion of real misery among men to make them comfortable. If they have nothing to complain of, they hunt after new fancies, turn Mormonites, Nullifiers, St. Simonians, fret themselves into fevers about the business of other people, and kick up a riot. Content seems to be a paradox, and should read discontent. But without motion there can be no health. Agitation throws out the bad humours of the body corporate. They gather into an unsightly pustule, suppurate, and are heard of no more. The South, therefore, will observe that it is not necessary to disturb themselves about any thing which is going on here. Any unwholesome appearances are merely the coming on of the fever, unsightly to be sure, but the more so from the sound health of the body. The agitators who talk of 'precious mischief,' are few in number; and if not persecuted into strength, will for the future be scarcely able to furnish materials for a paragraph. Pennsylvanian of Dec. 14, 1833.  roles,         Pennsylvanian of Dec.   

 'VESUVIUS.' The communication which we publish over this signature, is a severe but richly merited and well applied rejoinder to the infamous letter of J.N. Danforth. It was sent to us last April, but mislaid at that time. Mr. Danforth boasted, before a large audience in Salem, pointing in a bitter and taunting manner at us, as we sat by his side, that he had been 'offered TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS for the body of William Lloyd Garrison, by a southern slaveholder!' And what, think you, reader, was Mr. Danforth's reply to that blood-thirsty monster? Did he indignantly exclaim 'Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this?' Not he! He felt no indignation at the iniquity of the offer, nor because he was deemed a suitable person to act the part of a kidnapper. 'I told him,' says Mr. D. 'that we could not spare Mr. Garrison yet he is very useful to us at present, and we should not like to part with him'!!     

       The following (from a Vermont paper) is a genuine specimen of colonization equality!'Prejudice will ever prevent the white man from acknowledging the negro as an equal. His complexion is the cause of his fate, and until Almighty power shall change his skin, he must here form a part of a degraded and unfortunate race, and be doomed to a perpetual state of bondage and moral vassalage. Whatever may be their mental attainments, whatever may be their moral worth, they can never pass the line of demarkation; they can never share in the privileges and honors of our social relations. Exposed to every possible temptation, they are virtually shut out from every generous incentive to exertion. They are of an inferior caste. Hence our cities are crowded with idle, dissolute, and depraved blacks. Hence they enter, out of all due proportion, into our penitentiaries and jails. Their very name is a term of reproach. In many states we deny them the rights of citizens, and even when we draw nigh unto Him who is no respecter of persons, and in whose sight all distinctions of country and color are alike trivial, we keep them apart as though we feared pollution from their presence. We do not justify this feeling of aversion we deprecate it; BUT IT IS NATURAL; it cannot be rooted out.  The young African damsel, in the heart of Africa, shed tears, when she saw a white man enter her dwelling, and very candidly expressed to him her horror and distress at his shocking whiteness. With these feelings of aversion, the white and the black can never amalgamate. Let us take, then, the only method in our power to alleviate the evil: let us remove them to their 'father-land' where, with every honorable incentive to enterprise before them, they can gain the honest rewards of labor.'    and until Almighty power shall change his skin, he must here form a part of a degraded and unfortunate race, and be doomed to a perpetual state of bondage and moral vassalage.   we deprecate it;  it cannot be rooted out.   let us remove them to their 'father-land'    

 A HEAVY FIGURE. The Rev. Dr. Cox is publishing a sequence of numbers in the New-York Evangelist, descriptive of his visit to Europe. His style is too ambitious, too Johnsonian, to be read easily there is a needless accumulation of large and uncommon epithets a severe effort at fine writing. This, especially in a familiar 'Journal,' is always painful, having too much the appearance of 'giving to an inch the importance of a mile,' as Peter Pindar says. The fault arises, in this instance, from a native grandeur of mind, which labors to bring language up to its own mountainous elevation, and to express the magnitude of its conceptions by the bulkiness of words.The following is certainly a forcible figure. We cannot say that it is much to our taste, although it is greatly to our humor:'Occasionally, a lofty precipice of waters would break over her, and throw its fluid masses on her staggering deck, with a power that shook her timbers, as if forty elephants had fallen from the maintop. The poor ship would pause and quiver, like a sturdy bullock under the first blow before he falls to rise no more: she would then right herself, and renew the attack as if more spirited in the contest, and more certain of the victory.'The comparison of the stately ship to a sturdy bullock is diminutive and feeble. Byron, however, (begging pardon of the ladies,) has made a similar descent '----- O Night,And Storm, and Darkness, ye are wondrous strong!Yet lovely in your strength, as is the lightOf a dark eye in Woman,' &c.We will venture to suggest to the accomplished tourist, whether it is in good taste to mix up in his narrative, indiscriminately, matters of mirth and solemnity anecdotical drolleries and sacred reflections? These transitions are positively unpleasant, and frequently ludicrous. Let the descriptive constitute one essay the reflective another.

Our valuable friend RICHARD BARRETT spoke of it with much pleasure, as well as several other decided, pious characters. Much good has been done by your visit, to undeceive the British nation, in relation to the gross impositions of the Agent of those wholesale deceivers in the United States. The expose and development of its principles may injure some really benevolent object, that may hereafter claim our assistance; fearing a second Elliott Cresson may dupe us.

May that monster SLAVERY soon be exterminated from your delightful country! In the formation of your National Anti-Slavery Society, I trust you will avoid those fundamental errors into which we have fallen. After ten years of exertion, and the expenditure of thousands, we have obtained only an imbecile, inefficient, anomalous system, impracticable and pregnant with mischief.I beg leave to return my sincere thanks for the honor your Society has conferred upon me, by constituting me one of its honorary members. I trust that my future feeble but sincere co-operation in your noble cause will merit it.'  expose        

 LOGIC. The erudite conductor of the Boston Recorder says that the declaration of the National Anti-Slavery Convention, that Congress has no right to legislate upon the subject of slavery in the slave-holding States, is equivalent to maintaining that Congress must and ought to have such a right!! Admirable! If it were not too late, we should be tempted to send him a New-Year's Gift for his logical profundity.     

       1st. Elliott Cresson knows that the plan for removing the Free People of Color in the United States, to Africa, originated with the slaveholders in Virginia; and that the Society was finally organized at Washington, in the year 1817.2nd. E.C. knows that the 2nd Article of the Constitution of that Society reads as follows: 'The object to which its attention is to be exclusively directed, is to promote and execute a plan for colonizing (with their consent) the free people of color residing in our country, in Africa, or such other place as Congress shall deem most expedient. And the Society shall act, to effect their object, in co-operation with the general government, and such of the States as may adopt regulations upon the subject.'3rd. E.C. knows that the motives in which this scheme of Colonization originated, were, 1st Fear, that the free people of color would become too numerous to manage; and ultimately unite with the slaves to effect their emancipation. 2nd Prejudice. If not, why send away those with black skins, more than those with black hair?4th. E.C. knows that no sooner was the organization of this Society made public, than the free blacks and colored people came forward unanimously, and protested against the whole plan; and that their opposition has been loud and incessant from that time to the present.5th. E.C. knows that, notwithstanding this protestation of the colored people, the Colonization Society has steadily persevered in its object; trampling beneath its feet the opinions and feelings of this helpless and unoffending part of community; resorting to the most unworthy means to effect its purpose such as representing them as a vagrant race, a nuisance and a curse to the country, (yet, by the way, good missionaries for Africa!) denying them a residence in the land of their nativity, and contending that Africa is the only proper home for the black or colored man.6th. E.C. knows that those who have removed to Africa, have been compelled to go there; or, at least, they would not have gone, if they could have enjoyed equal privileges with other American citizens, differing from themselves only in the color of the skin.7th. E.C. knows that if Colonization Patriots and Statesmen, and Doctors in Divinity, together with the rest of the advocates of this Society, had been half as zealous in exerting their influence to break down that unhallowed prejudice which exists against the colored people, as they have been in endeavoring to get them out of the country; long ere this, it would have been removed.8th. E.C. knows that if the prejudices of the American people must be gratified, in the expulsion of their colored brethren, they are ABLE and ought to bear the expense themselves.9th. E.C. knows that whilst the Colonization Society admits that which no slaveholder denies, that Slavery is an evil; yet it boldly contends that slaves ought not to be manumitted, except on condition of their transportation of Africa.10th. E.C. knows that, according to this system, slavery never can come to an end in the United States.11th. E.C. knows that when he asserted that there were at least one hundred thousand slaves, that would be given up, if the means for their transportation to Africa could be obtained he asserted that which he could not prove to be true.12th. E.C. knows that the reports from Liberia, in reference to the state of the colony, widely vary from each other; and that he has taken special care to exhibit to the British public only the bright side of the question.13th. E.C. knows that the principal articles of trade of the colonists with the natives are Fire-arms, Gunpowder, Rum and Tobacco.14th. E.C. knows that himself, and the members of the American Colonization Society, are highly esteemed by the slaveholders and their advocates; but that they are held in utter abhorrence by the colored people and their friends. Finally,E.C. knows that William Lloyd Garrison has proved himself to be the decided enemy of prejudice and slavery, and the friend and advocate of the oppressed; and that he is, consequently, highly esteemed by the colored people and their friends, while he is equally hated by the Colonizationists, and the slaveholders are thirsting for his blood!!!When Elliott Cresson has the honesty to confess the veracity of the above statements, I shall have a few things more to tell him about the American Colonization Society, which he knows.    exclusively free our   Fear too numerous Prejudice        compelled     ought bear the expense       one hundred thousand              OMEGA.

 The preceding page is occupied by a valuable extract from the Rev. Mr. Phelps' new work. The names of ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR reverend 'fanatics' are also inserted, as an evidence of the feebleness of the anti-slavery cause! 'What is this world coming to?'   feebleness     

              In the New-York Commercial Advertiser of April 9, is a letter to W.L. Stone, from which I extract, and to which I superadd some expository notes.1. Mr. Garrison's Thoughts on African Colonization are thus flamingly described:'A work in which the most disgusting egotism is scarcely hidden in the folds of the grossest misrepresentation; and the wretched penury of argument attempted to be concealed by a cataract of abuse. It is a labored concoction of the mass of volcanic matter, which for two or three years past has been belched forth from that Vesuvius of the press, the Liberator.'Note 1. This was written by J.N. Danforth, Agent, &c.; who says that the members of our Anti-Slavery Society have more 'blood than brains.' Excellent! but the above paragraph contains nothing human; it is the 'blood and brains' only of diabolism!2. Hear this champion of gradual justice and mercy:'Garrison, whose pen is so venomous, that the laws have actually confined him in jail, as they would a lunatic. A disturber of the tranquillity of Southern society. Ten thousand dollars have been offered to me for his person, that he should be given up to justice! Who is at this moment in danger of being surrendered to the civil authorities of some one of the Southern States.'Note 2. The above contains a mass of atrocious slander and wilful falsehoods, exactly characteristic of an Agent for the colored people trading company. Mr. Garrison has broken no peace, violated no law, and exhibited no lunacy; but proclaimed common sense, and, like Paul and Silas, for turning the sinful world upside down, was cast into prison by the coadjutors of human flesh-traders. A Christian might as rationally expect mercy in Satan's hall of law, as an honest man hope for justice from slave drivers. 'Mark you!' Mr. Danforth; it is far more honorable to be an enemy of slavery in a jail, and a missionary in the Georgia Penitentiary, than to be a land-stealing slaveholder in a jury box, or a perjured man-thief on a court bench.It seems that the publication of truth in Boston disturbs the tranquillity of men-stealers in Carolina and Georgia. This is gloriously cheering intelligence.Much inquiry was recently made about the cause of Mr. Danforth leaving Washington. The secret is out; for, according to his own impudent confession, one may reasonably suppose that he went to Boston, altogether or partly to obtain $10,000 for kidnapping Mr. Garrison. This is one of the most shameless gratuitous avowals of daring felony upon record. Why has he not fulfilled the commission, and, Judas-like, received 'the price of blood?' The sole reason is this he knew that he would be shut up in the Massachusetts prison for life; and therefore he prefers a large salary for promulging calumny, and inventing fictions, and imposing upon the public by his quack nostrums, to the salutary lessons which he would learn in that castle of repentance. 'Mark you!' A Preacher of the gospel avows, that he has been offered 10,000 dollars to kidnap Mr. Garrison, that he may be murdered by Georgia Persecutors.Mr. Danforth also states that Wm. Lloyd Garrison is in momentary danger of being delivered up to the ruffian gripe of the slave drivers. A large reward has also been offered for me; and it may also be presumed, that I am also in danger of being given up by Mr. Danforth to what he calls justice! Betray a citizen who denounces felony into the hands of lawless pirates! If this is justice, what is unrighteousness? Therefore I hereby inform Mr. Danforth, that the first time he and I are in the same vicinity, if that fact is ascertained, he shall be transferred to the civil authorities, that he may be forced to give ample security not to kidnap peaceable christian citizens.'Mark you!' Mr. Danforth; and take care of yourself. You are watched. Take my advice. Quit your calumny, your falsehoods, and the kidnapping for which you can obtain such large rewards. Fulfil your commission, and seize Wm. Lloyd Garrison, if you dare; and then clandestinely transport him to the Catalines of Carolina and the Neros of Georgia: the outrage would be of no avail to extinguish the light upon slavery, and to nullify the laws of God, of Christ, and of conscience. There are twelve left behind, of whom you and your ungodly employers should acknowledge, and for once we would coerce the truth from your man-stealing confederacy 'Wm. Lloyd Garrison chastised us with whips, but his avengers lash us with scorpions.'3. Once more, hear this Agent of the American citizen exporting company, J.N. Danforth:'Those agents' of the Anti-Slavery Society 'have traversed the country, not the Southern portion; mark you! they are too discreet for that. They will meet no hindrances from me but such as truth and argument may create.'Note 3. 'Truth and argument' by Mr. Danforth. Bravo! What next? The anti-slavery men are very greedy for both those precious commodities; and as that Agent for the slave drivers professes to have a large, superfluous quantity of 'brains,' some of the overflowings of that treasury would be extremely acceptable. It is but candid, however, to declare 'mark you!' Mr. Danforth, that nearly a score of recent letters signed Joshua N. Danforth, recently published in the N.Y. Observer, the Boston Recorder, and by the other partizans of gradual abolition, and especially that famous letter to W.L. Stone, contain no truth and less argument. To use the appropriate style of the Preacher who boasts that he has been offered 10,000 dollars for kidnapping a talented citizen and philanthropist; those letters are edifying samples of 'a wretched penury' of 'truth and argument,' not even 'concealed by the cataract of abuse' and deceptions that characterize the loathsome treachery and malignity, which are 'scarcely hidden in the folds of the grossest misrepresentation.' The letter to W.L. Stone is exactly described by its author: 'it is a labored concoction of volcanic matter, belched forth from the Vesuvius' of kidnapping.Mr. Danforth assures us that the anti-slavery men shall have no hindrances to their measures but 'truth and argument.' How merciful! We shall be pleased to receive a small portion of both in the next letter to W.L. Stone; for upon the slavery question there is a most woful deficiency in those points. However, it is very desirable that he should not mention any thing about 10,000 dollars for kidnapping Christians; because that mass of silver combines so many weighty attractions, that time-serving politicians always wish to join partnership in handling such truth, and in feeling such 'knock down arguments.''Mark you!' Mr. Danforth observes that 'the Agents of the Anti-Slavery Society are too discreet to traverse the Southern portion of our country.' That is another fiction: for some anti-man-stealing missionaries, or as Messrs. Stone, Finley, Danforth, Gurley, ac id genus omne, call them, 'Incendiaries, Firebrands, Lunatics, and Fanatics,' are willing to make a tour from the Chesapeake to the Mississippi, and from the Potomac and the Ohio to the gulf of Mexico, and preach the gospel in its purity, grandeur and amplitude; with all fidelity proclaiming retribution for the man-stealers and emancipation to the oppressed; and urging upon the Canaanites and the Egyptians the gracious Saviour's doctrine 'Repent, O ye generation of vipers! flee from the wrath to come.''Mark you!' Mr. Danforth, and behave modestly. There is 'a rod for the fool's back' in 'a cataract' of pickle, to teach W.L. Stone's correspondent good manners, to make him speak truth and avoid slander; and especially that he may meet a hindrance to his kidnapping Mr. Garrison for 10,000 dollars. We hope that by timely reformation, the application of the rod may be superseded. 'Mark you!' and copy the discretion of them, who do not choose to rush uncalled into the midst of hindrances, which, like Mr. Danforth's letters, are void of 'truth and argument.' Write no more letters to W.L. Stone, 'belching forth' falsehood, calumny and kidnapping. And the Agent of the Colonization Society in Boston is cautioned to keep aloof from the volcanic crater of    Thoughts on African Colonization flamingly     Note J.N.

            MR. GARRISON As I have lately taken a journey to my native State, which has of course been interesting to me, I should like to be indulged in giving some account of it to your readers.On the morning of Wednesday, Jan. 8, I took a passage in the stage for Concord, N.H. My ride to Lowell was very pleasant: though there was a little snow and ice on the ground, yet it was very good wheeling. About 10 o'clock, I found myself in the little city, which is a fine illustration of the wonders which may be accomplished by freemen. I was surprised to find that it wore so much of the appearance of older cities, notwithstanding its extreme youth. From that place we went in a stage upon runners the rest of our journey. The weather was mild, the company agreeable, the sleighing excellent; and as I was on a journey towards home, I need not say that my time passed very pleasantly. At half past 4, I found myself in the capital of the 'Granite State.' It is a thriving village on the banks of the Merrimack river. From what I saw of the inhabitants I formed a very favorable opinion of them. I made arrangements for delivering an address on the subject of slavery on my return towards Boston. I saw the ministers of the place, and found them disposed to encourage and assist me. When I went into the house of Mr. Bouton, the Congregationalist minister, I was surprised to find a copy of the Address of the New-York City Anti-Slavery Society lying upon his table, appearing as if it had been thoroughly read. In conversation with me afterwards, he told me that he fully and cordially adopted the views and sentiments there set forth. I saw the Editor of the New-Hampshire Patriot, and asked him if he would have the kindness to insert a notice of the meeting I intended to hold in the town? When he learnt that I adopted the principle of immediate emancipation, he decided by refusing to do anything to encourage such a mad scheme. He gave me a specimen of his acute penetration, in the following sagacious declaration: 'This Anti-Slavery movement is all a trick of the Foreign Mission Society. Finding themselves sinking in public estimation, and fearing that they should not be able to rule the whole nation, they have got up this excitement in order to divide the Union, that they may govern the north, acting upon the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread.'Thursday morning I left Concord on my way to Hebron, where my father lives. My company, though entirely changed, was still very agreeable. About half past 12, I arrived at the tavern nearest my father's residence. A kind neighbor coming that way, very readily took my baggage, while I walked along on foot. I had previously sent word to Plymouth, that I should be there on Sabbath evening. While I remained in Hebron, I scarcely heard a whisper in favor of the American Colonization Society. Some of the people there had been opposed to it from its commencement. I spoke to the people on the subject of slavery on Saturday evening, in a large school-house. Though the weather was stormy, and the population scattering, yet the house was very nearly filled with attentive and intelligent listeners. I was much pleased with the appearance of they younger portion of the audience. Their blooming countenances, which gave indication of innocence and health, manifested a feeling of deep sympathy in the subject on which I was speaking. The next day I went to Plymouth, a distance of 8 miles, facing a storm of mingled snow and rain. While riding by the small, but comfortable houses which are scattered along on the high hills over which I passed, I was forcibly reminded of those beautiful lines of Goldsmith:'Dear is that but to which his soul conforms,And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms.And, as a child, whom scaring sounds molest,Clings close and closer to its mother's breast;So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roarBut bind him to his native mountains more.'*Iarrived at Plymouth, and found that the people there had made arrangements for having me speak in the meeting-house on Sabbath evening; at Campton, (a town adjoining) the next day at 2 o'clock; and again at Plymouth on Monday evening, in the Court House. My other engagements made it impossible for me to remain there Monday evening. With the other arrangements I joyfully complied. 'Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.' I found this aptly illustrated while I remained in Plymouth. The zeal and christian spirit manifested by the people there, was exceedingly gratifying. After my visit with them, I had reason to 'thank God and take courage.' The evening when I spoke to them, the meeting-house was splendidly lighted; a choir of excellent singers performed several pieces appropriate to the occasion; a sweet sounding organ, made without instruction by a genuine abolitionist, was played by a young lady, the daughter of the maker of it, who, if I might judge by the manner of her playing, was inspired with the true feeling of universal benevolence. In the course of my remarks, I spoke decidedly against the use of the produce of slave-labor, and alluded to the case of our fathers, who refused to drink tea, in the time that tried men's souls. After I had done speaking, I heard a venerable old gentleman say that he believed he must leave off using sugar. He remembered the time when he abstained from the use of tea, on account of the unjust tax upon it, and he thought he could practice self-denial now.The next morning, a gentleman came into the place where I was, and told me that his little daughter, as soon as she got home from the meeting, said she would never use any more sugar. Nothing had been said to her before on the subject.At Campton, though there had been but very little notice given, (owing to the fact that there was no preaching the day before,) yet there was a very respectable audience of the hardy yeomanry of that place assembled to hear me in the meeting-house. The New-England Telegraph has been working wonders there in the cause of abolition. Before it was known that I was in the State, they had made an appointment for a meeting in Campton for the formation of an Anti-Slavery Society, to be held the evening of that day on which I was there. I was very sorry that I could not consistently remain to be present at the meeting.At Campton, I was informed of a fact which somewhat surprised me. It was something which had never occurred to me before, and I hardly knew what to say or think. I hope that some of your learned correspondents will express their views on this subject. The fact is this: Some of our friends in C. reason in this manner. Whatever we employ an agent to do, we are responsible for ourselves. Now, as the Constitution of the United States supports slavery, or at least encourages and rewards it, we could not innocently take an oath to support such a Constitution. As all members of Congress are obliged to take such an oath, before entering upon the duties of their office, we cannot conscientiously vote for a man to do what we would not do ourselves. One man told me he had not voted for members of Congress for seven years, chiefly on that account.The people at Plymouth and Campton are sterling characters. The cause of abolition there, is triumphing gloriously. I hope some one who is on the spot will give the public a brief history of the rise and progress of abolitionism in that region.Tuesday morning I went to Lyme, (my native town) lying on Connecticut river. Thursday I went to Newbury, Vt., where I delivered an address on Saturday evening. The subject of slavery has scarcely been heard of there, except through the medium of the Vermont Chronicle. There are, however, cheering indications which lead me to hope that correct principles will speedily triumph in that quarter, over all sophistry.On Sabbath evening, I spoke to a very intelligent and respectable audience in the Academy at Bradford. Though the house was large, it was literally crowded to overflowing. They listened to me with death-like silence, for about an hour and a half. After I had closed, the minister of the place, Mr. George W. Cambell, made some statements and remarks, which were enough to make the cars of them that heard to tingle. To him, and all the clergymen who have kindly assisted me, I would now tender my warmest acknowledgments. May they be rewarded by the rich consciousness of having discharged their duty. The public sentiment in Bradford is cheering. I have good reason to believe that Colonizationism there is rapidly falling to rise no more.On Tuesday evening, I delivered an address to a very large audience in the Town Hall, at Lyme. Elder Cheny, the Baptist minister of the place, made two very interesting and appropriate prayers for the occasion. After I had closed my remarks, he told the audience that he hoped they would immediately form a Free Produce Association. He believed they could live on their own resources; and he hoped they would not encourage the men who were robbing the slaves of their honest earnings. Such is the spirit of New-Hampshire. Though not first in the field, they will show that they are not behind their brethren in zeal or self-denial.Wednesday afternoon I went to Dartmouth College, in Hanover. As notice had not been given of my intention to deliver an address there, I of course had no meeting. I was disappointed and grieved that the distinguished gentleman, to whom I sent the notice, did not have it read. May he, and all others, be immediately emancipated from the man-fearing spirit which brings a snare, and learn to fear God and Him only. It was, however, 'all for the best' that the notice was not given; for my health, which was feeble at the time, would have been very much impaired if I had spoken that evening. God overrules every thing for good.From what I saw and heard at that ancient seat of learning, I was led to believe that a spirit of inquiry was spreading there, which would eventuate in the complete triumph of abolition principles.Thursday evening I delivered an address in the Town Hall in Concord. Owing to the extreme severity of the weather, and a large military ball held there the same evening, my audience was small. There are some abolitionists in Concord, and their number is steadily increasing.The next day I returned to Boston, having been absent seventeen days, and delivered addresses in seven different towns. I have abundant cause for gratitude to God for His kind care over me, and to my fellow men for their hospitality, and the manifestations of their good will. May Heaven reward them!    freemen.  home,                              immediately emancipated           N.

          Concluded   The Society contemplates 'the removal and establishment, in a distant land, (Africa of course,) of a population of one hundred and fifty-six thousand blacks.' We learn in the second place, that an essential 'feature' in the Society's 'plan is to establish the colony on the temperance principle; (the result, no doubt, of some of your intemperate 'thrusts;') and receive NO EMIGRANT who will not engage to abstain from all use of, or traffic in, ardent spirits.' Or in the words of the address, 'There was another object, which the board of managers thought of much importance. This was the establishment of the temperance principle, as a fundamental one PROHIBITING ANY PERSON from leaving Maryland for Africa, who would not first agree to forbear the use of ardent spirit, except in case of sickness; and holding any person ineligible to office in the colonial government, who either used or trafficked in it.'Now, sir, there is either an absolute necessity for the removal of the colored population of Maryland, or there is not. We of course maintain the negative of this proposition colonizationists the affirmative; which is abundantly evinced by the strenuous and unprecedented efforts they are making to remove us; or by their declarations that if the slaves were emancipated and permitted to remain in their only true and appropriate home, 'they (says Mr. Read) would relapse, either into primitive indolence and its concomitant wretchedness and crime, or roused by freedom, they would advance in prosperity,(?) improve in character,(?) attain a higher grade of intelligence and knowledge (? important admissions!) and then, a struggle would commence for equal, civil, and political rights, which, if withheld, would keep us in perpetual agitation; if granted, would render every election a scene of violence and bloodshed!'Now, as colonizationists believe (what we do not) that these appalling evils would be the necessary consequence of emancipation without expatriation, who does not see, maugre all their professions to the contrary, that they are determined to expel us from the country, not with our, but 'with their own consent?' Who, sir, after hearing colonizationists denounce us as so 'alarming an evil,' can understand them when they talk of 'PROHIBITING any person from leaving Maryland for Africa, who would not first agree to forbear the use of ardent spirit, &c.?' Being 'the most degraded, the most corrupt, the most depraved, the most abandoned race on the earth a CURSE and a CONTAGION wherever we reside' is it not wonderful they will not permit us to leave Maryland until we shall have first demonstrated that we are more virtuous, or capable of a more rigid self-denial than a large majority of their countrymen, who, with all their intelligence and religion, have not yet embarked in the great temperance reformation; who have not yet obtained the mastery over their 'depraved' appetites so far as to be able to sign, (what thousands of our people have done,) the temperance pledge! And is it not still more wonderful that they will not permit us to leave Maryland for Africa, where they have more than intimated, we shall undergo, what we so much need, a regenerating process of moral acclimation!But suppose the colored population of our State should be so blind to their interests, as to refuse to sign the pledge what then? Why, as the Society is determined we shall not live here, they will have no other alternative than either to extort the pledge by flaggellation, or additional cruel enactments; or they must change their avowed principles, and deluge Cape Palmas with a flood of those maddening waters with which they have been renovating the colonists at Liberia, and SPIRITUALIZING the surrounding natives! The adoption of either expedient, as a dernier resort, could not fail to incur the odium of the wise and good every where; while it would effectually impede the march 'of civilization and the gospel through a benighted land.' Yes, sir, the day is not distant when the shrewd natives of Africa will learn the true character of colonizationists. Then, when the missionary attempts to proclaim the glad tidings of salvation, will he be indignantly repulsed by the sarcastic, the burning retort: 'Physician, heal thyself' 'mechristian devil christian!  The natives are not wholly unmindful of the practices of American christians. The following (written by Solomon Bayley, a colonist who recently returned to the United States) will do something more than corroborate this remark.'It is to be regretted,' says the writer, 'that powder, guns, and rum, were ever introduced as articles of trade; more especially the latter. The Society saw and felt, but too late to be easily remedied, the injurious tendency of introducing those articles among the Africans. They were, for a time, prohibited, and soon a native chief sent in to inquire the reason. One of our head men (a preacher) want out to give an explanation, and the following palaver, as stated to me took place between him and one of the native speakers 'Well, daddy,' said the latter,' what's the matter American man no willing to sell countryman powder, guns, and rum?' The preacher answered 'Our God say it be no good fash, (fashion) it be bad fash too much, to sell countrymen powder, guns, and rum:' to which the other replied 'Ah! if your God say it be no good fash, me no buy;' and after a pause, he added 'stop, daddy, me want to speak dat palaver good, you say, that your God say it be no good fash to sell countrymen powder, guns, and rum; what's the matter your God don't tell American man not to BUY powder, guns, and rum'? The answer to this close question was not at hand, and the native speaker continued: 'If your God say it no be good fash to sell countrymen powder, guns, and rum; no more me no sell American man no rice, no camwood, no ivory, no Spanish dollar, no doubloon: all trade we sell to Spaniard; me no sell American man no trade.' I need hardly tell the reader, continues the writer, 'that this resolute stand taken by the natives brought back the trade in powder, guns, and rum.'Sir, I am admonished not to trespass upon your columns. I therefore leave much untouched, to which I had intended to advert. I shall not stop to notice certain points in the address, which I consider in the light of tacit and reluctant admissions of the truth of some of your past allegations. I shall only add, we have no fears of the ultimate success of colonizationists. They are now withering under the rebuke of an indignant world. Their plans are fraught with the elements of dissolution. Their days are numbered; and an eventful jubilee is dawning.

 ANTI-SLAVERY. In our last was printed the DECLARATION of the National Anti-Slavery Convention, recently held at Philadelphia. The positions therein taken and maintained by the signers thereof, are undoubtedly well understood by most of our readers. Since its publicity, we have been closely interrogated by several professed friends in regard to its import, and the 'dangerous tendency' of spreading such sentiments as the 'dangerous document,' contained, to which we prefer making public reply, by giving reasons why the able Declaration was transferred to our columns.1st. Because we are admonished by every principle of right that the traffic in human blood, bones, and sinews, in life, liberty, and in every thing that appertains to the social welfare of man is wrong. That if there ever was a time when it was necessary to hold our black fellow-citizens in bondage in order to throw of the chains of our own oppressors, that time has passed by. That the plea of expediency will never justify the American people in encouraging this horrid traffic.2d. Because we felt it a duty, as an advocate of the oppressed, to take a stand in opposition to the humiliating and degrading policy of the Slaveholders and their feed supporters, and because we feel disposed to lend our limited aid in undoing the heavy burdens which rest upon the shoulders of the injured Africans in our country, by helping to obliterate the most foul stain that ever did or ever can disgrace the nation's character.3d. Because we are convinced that so great a question as that of MAN-BUYING and MAN-SELLING cannot be too freely discussed in a community of persons calling themselves freemen! and that it is the duty of those who direct the public press to thoroughly investigate it for the benefit of their readers.The enemies to the slave system are daily accused of fanaticism, they are denounced as incendiaries and as lovers of discord. They are branded with the most vile anathemas, and assailed with the most bitter invective, and that too by those who hold sacred the first paragraph of the Declaration of American Independence, the letter of which it is unnecessary to quote. The United States of America have elicited the severe, though just, animadversions of other nations upon their course of proceeding of nations, which they themselves dislike on account of their aristocratical, monarchical, or despotic mode of government. Our Republican forms are becoming more and more unpopular on account of the cheerfulness with which they seem to sanction the Slave system and it is to be feared they will not be adopted by other nations, because they are so abused by our own. This is a sad matter of reflection, but the cause of humanity requires that it be thought of, and investigated with care. New Bedford Working-men's Press.

       To the Editor of the Liberator:I proceed with the specific inquiry contained in the closing paragraph of my last number. And I repeat in this connection, that we may not, consistently, justifiably, or without deep wrong, aid in sustaining erroneous Popular Opinion, as evinced in the support of the slave system, by participating in the production of that system.I must confess I have found myself mistaken, since I commenced an examination of this subject, as to the extent of the ground to be traversed in defence of the position I have laid down. Waiving the question of expediency, I have taken my stand upon the broad yet uniform principle of Right and Wrong, and this leaves me little room for detail or statistical facts. I throw upon the supporters of the other side the labor of proving how things ought to be by making them square with existing advantages. In other words, the labor of arranging a plan by which the conscience may be lulled asleep by as little an admixture of impurity in our motives and actions as will consist with our enjoyment of the good things of this life. Freed, then, as I find myself, from the very nature of the case, of this labor of detail, I have the more time to devote to a survey of the moral question.Whoever comes to your place of business, or mine, Mr. Garrison, and employs one or the other of us in the way of our profession, contributes directly, and immediately, to our support: it matters not whether be pay us a shilling or a year's living for the work we perform. Whoever pays his annual tax into the municipal or civil treasury, directly sustains the city or state in which he lives. The window's mite, bestowed in charity, aids the beneficiary for whose behoof the alms are taken. One vote may turn the event of an election, and settle the principles of an administration; and thus, for a series of years, influence the prosperity of the country, perhaps forever. And lastly, every man, who partakes of the fruits of slave-labor, contributes, in some degree, directly towards the support, and of course to the existence of Slavery.Would slavery exist, if the labor of slaves were not profitable to the slaveholder? What makes that labor profitable?Now it is not enough to say, 'I am only one and if I did not buy, and eat, and wear the productions of slave-labor, others would, and thus nothing would be gained!' This is the very idlest of arguments. A rich merchant is traversing a lonely road between two marts, and at dusk is observed by two highway-men, one stronger than the other, but either of them fully able to master the intended victim. The weakest of the robbers approaches the merchant: the stronger sees the wealth within his grasp, and says within himself, 'Why may I not appropriate this fortune to myself? If I do not, yonder fellow will, so that nothing will be gained!' Would such a plea be permitted this sophistical cut-throat, at the bar of justice, think you?Again: Apply this argument to the subject of Intemperance. Would any friend to the noble measures, so uniformly in a process of operation in this country at present, for the suppression of that vice, encourage the tradesman who deals out liquid death to his fellow-men, by purchasing of him what he could just as easily obtain of another, who does not traffic in those deadly drugs? And so in any trade; what right-minded, conscientious artisan will lend himself, even in the way of business, as an auxiliary to vice, by constructing a house to be used, as he well knows, for the purposes of prostitution and abandonment? What honest, upright lawyer, will advise a client to commit a fraud, although his own pockets may be filled by its perpetration? No,sir, the old maxim is a true one; and although self-condemning be the confession, Truth compels me to make it, 'The receiver is as bad as the thief!' that is, if he be a receiver, with a full view of the guilt of the thief: and I do not see how we can purchases southern cotton, tobacco, rice, and sugar, without becoming accessory to the enormous guilt of holding our fellow-men in bondage. Thus is it that we, too, are slaveholders, at the north: yes, we! who, with the graceful yet powerful poet of the 'Task,' have so often to each other exclaimed,'I would not have a slave to till my ground,To carry me, to fan me when I sleep,And tremble when I wake, for all the wealthThat sinews, bought and sold, hare ever earned!No! dear as freedom is, and, in my heart'sJust estimation, prized above all price,I had much rather be myself the slave,And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him!'We, I say, are guilty of this very sin! For us the wretched slave tills the ground for us be trembles when his master wakes, and without our aid bestowed, his burthen might be lighter, and nearer to a removal.I shall renew this subject in another number.

       The immediate Emancipationists will neither draw the sword, nor separate from those who hold slaves. 'If smitten on one cheek, they will turn the other.' They will endeavor to 'to enlighten public opinion where the power to act exists.' This is the very thing they have always been aiming to effect. But whence must this light go forth? Not surely from those points, where almost total darkness broods over this subject. Almost all the light there is on this subject is in the non-slaveholding States. But very much needs to be done to produce a correct public sentiment in these States. People in general are ready enough to avow their hostility to slavery, and to sigh over it as a tremendous evil. Many having done this, stop. They seem to suppose that they have done about all which they are required to do, or all which can be done. If you make an additional remark relating to the evils of slavery, they tell you how much the Colonization Society is doing; as though nothing more were practicable in freeing the nation from a burden under the weight of which it groans, and under the guilt of which it is sinking into perdition. If you introduce the doctrine of immediate emancipation, instantly, all the 'abusive epithets,' 'the inflammatory speeches,' 'the incendiary publications,' 'the fanatical zeal,' and 'the hair brained measures' of Wm. Lloyd Garrison rise up, and so completely fill the whole vision, that all the evils of slavery, great and manifold as they are, dwindle and at length become entirely invisible. The sins of that single individual are of such number and magnitude, as to shed a veil of impenetrable darkness over all the guilt and danger of slavery. Before some minds you cannot keep the evils of slavery, because of the absorbing influence of Mr. Garrison's faults. You will find ten men to apologise for the slave-holders, where you will find one to for Mr. Garrison. For many things Mr. G. deserves censure, and he has received it both from friends and foes. Let men be blamed according to their deserts; and in estimating their deserts, let every palliating circumstance have its due weight. Correspondent of the Christian Mirror.

       Hanging in Effigy. The quiet city of Utica has recently been much excited by excesses committed by the opponents of 'Anti-Slavery,' and 'Temperance,' who assembled to the number of two hundred, erected a gallows upon which they burnt two gentlemen in effigy, and then proceeded in procession, blowing horns, and rolling a burning tar-barrel through Gennessee street. The festivities closed with a bonfire, the fuel for which consisted of 'TemperanceRecorders.' The mob formed a ring around the fire and celebrated a dance upon the funeral pile of ANTI-SLAVERY and TEMPERANCE. The 'actors in the scene' were not in the slightest degree embarrassed by the interference of the City Authorities.  Hanging in Effigy Anti-Slavery Temperance festivities Temperance Recorders.

          THE OPINION OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR CLERGYMEN        The following as will be seen, is an expression of opinion from quite a number of clergymen, on the much agitated subject of slavery and its remedy. It is due to those, who have thus consented to come before the public as the advocates of immediate emancipation, to say, that they have done it at my solicitation as an individual, in my individual capacity, and not as associated with any particular society. They are not, therefore, to be considered as committed by this act to any society, or to any sentiments not expressed in the document to which they have annexed their names. The object, and the only object aimed at in this measure, is to secure a decided expression of opinion on these two cardinal points, 1. That Colonization is not an adequate remedy for slavery, and must therefore be abandoned for something that is; and 2. That the scheme of Immediate Emancipation is such a remedy, and is therefore to be adopted and urged. Such, as will be seen, is the substance of the following  cardinal points,      'The undersigned, after mature deliberation, feel themselves constrained by a sense: of duty to God and man, to make the following expression of opinion. We believe,1. That Slavery in our land a great and threatening evil.2. That it is a great and crying national sin.3. That every man whether he live at the North, South, East or West, is personally responsible, and has personal duties to discharge in respect to it.4. That every man, who adopts opinions or pursues practices, which adopted and pursued by all others, would go to perpetuate this sin, does thereby become personally guilty in respect to it.5. We believe that slavery, like other sins, ought to be remedied as soon as the nature of the case admits; and further, that the nature of the case admits the possibility and therefore imposes the obligation of Immediate Emancipation.6. That such emancipation is both the duty and the interest of the master.7. That although the people of the non-slaveholding States, have not the right of physical or legal interposition in the case, they have the right, and that it is their solemn duty to do what they can by 'light and love' to enlighten the public mind, arouse the public conscience, and change and elevate the tone of public sentiment on the subject, in every section of the land.And finally, we believe that the grand obstacle, to the abolition of this sin, lies in the will of the slaveholder that this will being changed, there would of necessity be a change in the various laws and other obstacles which have grown out of it; and that this will is to be changed, (1), by the power of public sentiment among non-slaveholders, and (2), by means of kind, candid, and thorough discussion with slaveholders themselves.In respect to the scheme of Colonization, which at the North professes to be a scheme of gradual and ultimate, through 'incidental' emancipation, we feel constrained to say1. That whatever its merits are, it can never be an adequate remedy for slavery; and2. That the time has now come when the friends of God and man ought to take a higher stand, and adopt and act on principles which lay the axe directly at the root of the tree.            possibility       finally will   incidental     directly      Rev.

 DIED In this city, on Saturday, 25th inst. Mrs. Louisa Nell, aged 42, of consumption.How often we are called upon to witness the work of death! The solemnity of the scene seems like a warning voice saying, 'Watch, therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour the son of man cometh.' It is indeed a dreary summons, but one that must be attended to, and one that appears congenial to the feelings when we can exclaim, 'Oh Death, where is thy sting? Oh Grave, where is thy victory?' To a person the death of a friend is appalling. But still more so when it is the death of a parent.        Communicated. Communicated.     

 It is due to the Anti-Slavery cause to say, that these are by no means all the individuals, who are known as taking the ground of immediate emancipation.One word more. I have solicited the names of persons of various denominations, not to swell the number, but to make the impression at the outset that this, like the cause of Temperance, is a common cause a common work.To those who have given their names as above, I would here return my sincere and hearty thanks. The sentiments to which they have thus pledged themselves are at present unpopular, but 'in patience possess ye your souls.' They are the sentiments of truth and righteousness, and therefore, spite of the wrath of man, they will yet triumph over error and oppression.

       It will be seen from the whole tenor of my remarks in the lectures, that I have no confidence in the scheme of Colonization. It is proper, to prevent misunderstanding, to make the following brief remarks.1. I cheerfully admit that the scheme has the confidence of many good men especially at the North, who, I have no doubt, espouse it from the best of motives.2. The mere colonizing of colored or white persons, with their own, unconstrained consent, is in itself, a harmless and innocent affair.3. To plant truly christian colonies, on the coast of Africa, or any where else in this way, is a very laudable enterprise, and I, for one, should be willing to patronize it.These then are not the reasons of my dissent from the present Colonization scheme. I do dissent however,1. Because it departs from its design, as expressed in the constitution of the Society, and proposes itself as the remedy for slavery, thus claiming for itself the monopoly of the public confidence and co-operation.2. Because, thus departing, it promises what it can never perform viz. remedy slavery. In proposing to remedy slavery by transportation, or by the moral influence of such a physical operation, it proposes a physical impossibility. Make what arithmetical calculations you please, and yet, it is everlasting truth, the project is Utopian. You might as soon think to remove all the 'ring-straked, speckled and grisled' cattle from the land, by the mere process of colonizing, with their own consent, those only, of these classes, that run at large and have no master. Emigration does not depopulate. Every emigrant, but makes room for another, to occupy his place. For aught I know, there are as many Irishmen in Ireland now, as when she first began to pour her thousands of emigrants into America. You can never put a stop to increase never extirpate a race by mere voluntary emigration. So far from it, emigration does but quicken increase, and cause the race, that is thus spreading itself, to strike its roots deeper and deeper in its native soil. And the same or similar causes, which prevent an English population from rushing in and crowding out the Irish, as emigration goes on from Ireland, will operate to prevent a white population from rushing in to take the place of the colored, as emigration may go forward from the Southern States. The white population may and doubtless will drive the colored into the more Southern States and concentrate it there; but when thus concentrated, as is now extensively the fact, then the more brisk voluntary emigration, the more brisk the increase. This will hold as true of them, as of Ireland or New-England. Pray, how has it happened that emigration has not extirpated the Yankees; or at least caused the Irish, or the Dutch or some other population to come in and supplant them? It is nonsense then it is contrary to all the laws of increase to suppose that a race of men are to be extirpated by mere voluntary emigration; and as to any other, the present scheme of colonizing, professedly at least, disavows it.3. Because it does not promise even, to remedy slavery short of one or two hundred years; and for one, I hope to see the millenium come before that time.4. Because it stands in the way of other and more efficient schemes of remedy. This it does by taking the ground of gradual emancipation, and claiming, at the same time, to be the only practicable scheme. Suppose a national temperance society organized on the principle of moderate use, claiming to itself that this is the only feasible or correct principle of reform, securing to itself the sanction of the great and the good throughout the land, the votes of legislatures, ecclesiastical bodies, &c. &c., thus thrusting itself upon the attention, and monopolizing to itself the confidence of the public mind, as being the great national measure for the remedy of intemperance who so blind as not to see, that it must, of necessity, stand in the way of all other measures? that so long as the public mind rests in this as the great, the national, the only practicable measure, it is lulled to sleep, and cannot be aroused to any other? The analogy is perfect.5. Because it puts public sentiment back instead of advancing it. This it does in the way just specified. It makes up the public mind to the position, that this is the only practicable method of reaching the difficulty, and though the process be slow and its accomplishment distant, it yet causes it to believe and rest in the belief, that nothing more rapid is practicable. In this way it puts the public mind to rest, lulls its conscience to sleep, and whether intentionally or not, does in point of fact lower the tone of feeling and put back public sentiment on the subject.Nor is this mere 'a priori' inference. I have documents on hand which demonstrate, that the tone of public sentiment on the subject of slavery was higher, thirty and forty and even ten years ago, than it was a year since before the anti-slavery discussions came up. They used to speak of slavery as a SIN. Take the following facts as proof.As long ago as 1790, there were quite a number of Abolition-Societies organized in different parts of the United States. They were called Societies for the 'Abolition of Slavery, &c. &c.' They seem to have aimed at the abolition of slavery as their main and ultimate object, and this in three distinct ways, (1), and mainly, by aiming at the abolition of the slave-trade; (2), by attempting the release of persons who were kidnapped, or otherwise illegally held in bondage; and (3) by endeavoring the elevation of the colored people, by schools, &c. &c. Accordingly, in 1790, they presented various petitions to Congress praying for the abolition of the slave-trade. In them however, they incidentally give us their views of slavery itself. Take the following extracts as illustrations.'To the Honorable the Senate, &c. 'The Petition, &c. 'Humbly sheweth,'That, from a sober conviction of the unrighteousness of slavery, your petitioners have long beheld, with grief, a considerable number of our fellow men doomed to perpetual bondage, in a country which boasts of her freedom.''Your petitioners are fully of opinion, that calm reflection will at last convince the world, that the whole system of African slavery is unjust in its nature impolitic in its principles and, in its consequences, ruinous to the industry and enterprise of the citizens of these States.'From a conviction of these truths, your petitioners were led, by motives, we conceive, of general philanthropy, to associate ourselves for the protection and assistance of this unfortunate part of our fellow-men; and, though this society has been lately established, it has now become generally extensive through this state, and, we fully believe, embraces, on this subject, the sentiments of a large majority of its citizens.'(Signed) 'In the name, and by order, of the Connecticut Society for the promotion of freedom, &c.         christian       transportation     only principle the great national measure      .              embraces, on this subject, the sentiments of a large majority of its citizens   Connecticut Society    EZRA STILES, President of said Society. President of said Society   SIMEON BALDWIN, Secretary.New-Haven, Jan. 7, 1791.'The Memorial of the Pennsylvania Society, has the following.'We wish not to trespass upon your time, by referring to the different declarations made by Congress on the unalienable right of all men to equal liberty; neither would be attempt, in this place, to point out the inconsistency of extending freedom to a part only of the human race.'Again:'The Memorial of the subscribers, formed into a Society for the Abolition of Slavery, &c. in BALTIMORE:'Respectfully sheweth,'That the objects of their association are founded in reason and humanity. That, in addition to an avowed enmity to slavery in every form, your memorialists, in their exertions, contemplate a melioration of the condition of that unhappy part of the human race who are doomed to fill the degraded rank of slaves in our country, and a protection of the unhappy sons of Africa, who are entitled to liberty, but unjustly deprived of it.''It is no less painful to know, than to communicate to your honorable body, that a traffic so degrading to the rights of man, and so repugnant to reason and religion, as that in human flesh, is carried on by the free citizens of these free governments, for the supply of foreigners thus exhibiting to the world the curious and horrid spectacle, of liberty supporting slavery and the successful asserter of his own rights, the unprovoked and cruel invader of the rights of others.'And farther;'The Memorial of the Virginia Society, for promoting the Abolition of Slavery, &c.'Respectfully sheweth,'That your Memorialists, fully believing that righteousness exalteth a nation, and that slavery is not only an odious degradation, but an outrageous violation of one of the most essential rights of human nature, and utterly repugnant to the precepts of the gospel, which breathes peace on earth, good will to men; they lament that a practice, so inconsistent with true policy and the unalienable rights of men, should subsist in so enlightened an age, and among a people professing, that all mankind are, by nature, equally entitled to freedom.'Take another illustration of the sentiment prevalent on the subject at that time. On the 15th of September of the same year, the younger Edwards, then pastor of a church in New-Haven, and afterwards President of Union College, preached a sermon before the above mentioned Connecticut Society, in which he holds the following language.*'The arguments which have been urged against the slave-trade, are with little variation applicable to the holding of slaves. He who holds a slave, continues to deprive him of that liberty, which was taken from him on the coast of Africa. And if it were wrong to deprive him of it in the first instance, why not in the second? If this be true, no man has a better right to retain his negro in slavery, than he had to take him from his native African shores. And every man who cannot show, that his negro hath by his voluntary conduct forfeited his liberty, is obligated immediately to manumit him.''I presume it will not be denied, that to commit theft or robbery every day of man's life, is as great a sin as to commit fornication in one instance. But to steal a man or to rob him of his liberty is a greater sin, than to steal his property, or to take it by violence. And to hold a man in a state of slavery, who has a right to his liberty, is to be every day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or of man-stealing. The consequence is inevitable, that other things being the same, to hold a negro slave, unless he has forfeited his liberty, is a greater sin in the sight of God, than concubinage or fornication.''To convince yourselves, that your information being the same, to hold a negro slave is a greater sin than fornication, theft or robbery, you need only bring the matter home to yourselves. I am willing to appeal to your own consciences, whether you would not judge it to be a greater sin for a man to hold you or your child during life in such slavery, as that of the negroes, than for him to indulge in one instance of licentious conduct, or in one instance to steal or rob. Let conscience speak, and I will submit to its decision.''Thirty years ago, scarcely a man in this country thought either the slave trade or the slavery of negroes to be wrong. But now how many and able advocates in private life, in our legislatures, in Congress, have appeared and have openly and irrefragably pleaded the rights of humanity in this as well as other instances? Nay, the great body of the people from New-Hampshire to Virginia inclusively, have obtained such light, that in all those States, the further importation of slaves is prohibited by law. In Massachusetts and New-Hampshire, slavery is totally abolished.' 'This light is still increasing, and in time will effect a total revolution. And if we judge of the future by the past, within fifty years from this time, it will be as shameful for a man to hold a negro slave, as to be guilty of common robbery or theft.'Yet more; in 1793, there was a New-Jersey Society for promoting the abolition of slavery. Among other officers it had an acting committee of five members, in Middlesex, Essex, Monmouth, Morris, Sussex, Hunterdon, Burlington, Gloucester, Salem and Cumberland Counties. The whole State seems to have been put under an efficient organization. The following is an extract from the preamble to its Constitution:'It is our boast, that we live under a government founded on principles of justice and reason, wherein life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are recognized as the universal rights of men; and whilst we are anxious to preserve these rights to ourselves, and transmit them inviolate, to our posterity, we abhor that inconsistent, illiberal, and interested policy, which withholds those rights from an unfortunate and degraded class of our fellow-creatures.'And in addition to all the rest, I have in my hands the 'Minutes of the Proceedings of the Fourth Convention of Delegates from the Abolition Societies, established in different parts of the United States, assembled at Philadelphia, on the third day of May, 1797, and continued' in session 'until the ninth day of the same month, inclusive,' a session of six days. Delegates were present from 'New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Richmond, and Alexandria; and societies in various other places are reported as sending no delegates.Now in view of the above facts and extracts, illustrative of the tone of feeling then prevalent, I ask whether it be not indisputably evident, that, up to the recent discussions, public sentiment, on the subject of slavery, has been going back? Where were the men two years ago, when Colonization held the monopoly of the public confidence, that took the high ground of President Edwards in respect to the wickedness of slaveholding? Where is the Colonizationist that does it now? Who does not know, that the operation of this scheme on his mind has been to modify and lower down his abhorrence of slavery, so much at least as to fill him with misgivings at the thought of taking the high ground of Edwards, that the master ought 'immediately to manumit' his slave, and that not to do it, but to hold him in involuntary servitude is 'man-stealing,' and 'a greater sin in the sight of God than concubinage or fornication'?Is it said that Colonization is not answerable for this going back of public sentiment that the above-mentioned abolition societies were dead, and public sentiment gone back before Colonization came into existence?True; but Colonization is answerable for keeping it back. It had gone back, but just as it began to rise again just as the public feeling, that had slumbered for a little season, began to gather and pent up as it was, to demand some vent, then Colonization came in, proposed to strike off the chains of the captive, and gave the desired vent, but unhappily in such a direction and on the admission of such principles, as, in effect, to leave slavery untouched, and yet put the public mind to rest again, and, to all practical purposes, keep it in the same torpid state from which it was just awaking.The facts in the case were these. The enemies of slavery, both in this country and in England, made strenuous and almost simultaneous efforts for the abolition of the slave-trade. This they did under the erroneous impression that, if they could abolish the trade, slavery would die of itself. They succeeded in the effort. The slave-trade was abolished by law and measures taken to carry the laws into effect. Of consequence the friends of abolition, both here and in England, rested for a time in this, expecting that before long, it would issue in the destruction of slavery. It was during this period, and owing principally to this cause, that the above-mentioned societies became virtually dead, and that the tone of public feeling was lowered. The friends of the cause felt, for the time, that the victory was won, and their minds accordingly were put to sleep on the subject. This was true in England as well as here. It was not long, however, before they found out their mistake, and learned after all their efforts, that slavery still survived, and that the slave trade was carried on as briskly as ever, and with even greater cruelty. They saw, therefore, that nothing effectual could be done until slavery itself was abolished. At this, therefore, they must next direct their efforts. But how reach the matter how accomplish the object? And with this, public feeling and sentiment began to rise again. In England, the friends of the cause began with amelioration and failed then tried gradual emancipation and failed, and were thus forced to the dilemma of consenting to the perpetual existence of slavery, or of going, with all their might, for its immediate and entire abolition. They resolved on the latter, they took their stand, the public mind was aroused so as it had never been before, and in six years, the work was done the fetters were stricken from every slave in the colonies.In this country the course of events was different. The friends of the cause saw that nothing could be done, except as slavery itself was assailed and demolished, but how should they touch that? There was the sacred constitution, each State much legislate for itself, and a thousand other difficulties, so that there seemed to be no practicable way of reaching the subject at all. The public mind therefore remained at rest on the subject longer than in England. Still it could not be entirely at rest. As England went on with her schemes of amelioration and gradual emancipation, from this and other causes, the feeling began to rise that something must be done here. The feeling rose higher and higher, and gathered strength and struggled for vent. Just at that point the Colonization scheme stepped in, let off the pressure of feeling which then existed, and which, but for that, had probably taken the same direction it did in England, and issued in the same glorious results it let that feeling off, and, from that time to the present, has continued to operate as a kind of waste-gate to public feeling; or rather, I should say, as the safety-valve of slavery, letting off continually, in one way and another, those feelings of abhorrence and indignation, which, but for it, had by this time, engrossed the public mind, aroused its slumbering energies to resistless action, and thus swept away every vestige of slavery from the land. It has turned off the public eye from the hideousness of slavery by its honied apologies; and whatever of public feeling may or would have arisen from time to time, on the subject, it has either quelled, at the outset, by its cries of a 'necessary evil,' an 'unfortunate state of society,' &c., or let off in the direction of Liberia, instead of allowing it to rise, and swell and concentrate its energies on the system of slavery. It has thus in point of fact, operated-continually as a mere safety-valve to slavery not that it has been so regarded by most of its advocates, but simply that such has been its actual operation. In more senses than one, it has operated as a 'drain' to carry off what had otherwise, by this time, shaken the system to its foundation. I deem it clear, then, that the scheme operates mightily to put back and keep back public sentiment on the subject, and feel bound, therefore, to abandon it.6. Because, in present circumstances, its movements do but sanction and encourage the most highhanded oppression. This it does by the admission of the principle that emancipation may be conditioned on expatriation. All its operations go on the admission of this principle. It comes, therefore, with all the authority of the bar, the legislature, the ecclesiastical assembly, the pulpit, and the press, and begets and sanctions in the public mind the idea, that emancipation on condition of removal is right is all even, that justice demands. It thus sanctions a false principle, and, what is more, a principle, which, in the present aspect of things, seems to be fraught with oppressions and cruelties, well nigh as grievous as those of slavery itself. Witness the legislative acts of Maryland on the subject. Its sum of one hundred thousand dollars for the colonization of people of color, is appropriated on such conditions as make it little better than a bribe to oppression. It is a price put into the hand of the oppressor, by which to force his unoffending and trodden-down brother to the execrable alternative of wearing the yoke of servitude, or quitting his country. For say what you may about 'their own consent,' facts warrant the assertion that in many cases, there is no consent, save such an one as that by which the Indians have been driven to the west of the Mississippi a mere choice of evils. And this, be it remembered, is but the legitimate result nay, is but the acting out of that one principle, admitted and sanctioned by all the operations of the colonizing scheme that emancipation on condition of removal is right is all even, that in our peculiar circumstances, justice demands. The scheme thus, whether wittingly or not, does in fact become the parent of the most high-handed oppression.7. Because it throws innumerable obstacles in the way of the improvement of the free people of color, in this country. This it does, by begetting and sanctioning the idea in the public mind, that the colored man cannot be elevated here, but, if at all, must be elevated in Africa or elsewhere. This idea, sanctioned as it is by the simple operation of the scheme, is as wicked and disastrous as the one just specified. It is part and parcel of the same. It is fatal to effective effort in behalf of the colored man on the part of the white, and equally fatal to all ambition and effort on the part of the colored man in his own behalf. It is an idea that sunders all the sinews of action at once and forever.I omit an extended notice of the objection so often and so justly urged, that the whole tendency and operation of this scheme is to deepen and perpetuate, and an the same time, sanction, and excuse, and even sanctify that ungodly prejudice, which is already so rife in the community, and so pregnant with mischief to its unoffending victims. No man can over-estimate the weight of this objection. But I must not enlarge upon it. I must pass from the tendencies of the scheme in this country to its tendencies in Africa. I object to Colonization then,8. Because, it promises for Africa, what it never has and never can perform viz. the introduction of civilization and christianity among the natives. This is missionary work, and if ever done, must be done by missionaries set apart expressly to it, and not by men or ministers, such as Teague and Waring and several others that might be named, who will lay aside their sacerdotal robes the moment they reach their field of labor, and turn merchants, and get a living by selling rum, spear-pointed knives, powder and guns. These are not the men, nor these the means of civilizing and christianizing any people.And besides, such is the nature of man, such the nature of the case, that colonies, of the very best materials, never will or can be made the means of civilizing and christianizing the natives of a country. The very nature of the enterprise is such, and all history proves it, that the colonists and natives will have separate interests so separate as to prevent their mutual amalgamation. The line of distinction will always be kept up, and so long as it is, there is an end to all civilization and christianity. This was the fact wit these American colonies. This is the fact in Liberia now. We have it on the authority of the Rev. J.R. Pinney, the Presbyterian missionary, and now acting Governor of the Colony. And what does he say the distinction in question does not exist? Hear him 'NOTHING has been done for the natives, hitherto, by the colonists, except to educate a few who were in their families in the capacity of servants. The natives are, as to wealth and intellectual cultivation, related to the colonists as the negro in America is to the white man and this fact, added to their mode of dress, which consists of nothing usually, but a handkerchief around the loins, leads to the same distinction as exists in America between colors. A colonist of any dye (and many there are of a darker hue than the Vey, or Dey, or Croo, or Bassoo) would, if at all respectable, think himself degraded by marrying a native.' Here then you have the distinction in all its strength and more, you have its results. 'Nothing has been done for the natives, except,' &c.! The truth is, the whole tendency of colonies is, not to incorporate the natives with themselves, but to exist as separate communities, having separate interests, and so doing, to drive the natives back and back, and back to ultimate extermination. Nor can this tendency be ever effectually counteracted. How ever circumstances may vary in different cases, yet the general principles of the operation, and therefore its general tendencies, are and must evermore be the same. Colonization is a good measure to people an uninhabited country; or, when a people, like the Canaanites of old, have filled up the measure of their iniquity, and God wishes to inflict summary punishment on them, then it is a good measure to exterminate and cut them off. It answers such purposes well, but is useless, and worse than useless, as to all purposes of reform and salvation.9. Because it aims at securing two incompatible objects viz. the end, or gratification of prejudice and of benevolence.Prejudice says, send the people of color to Africa, and get them out of my way. They can't be elevated here, neither do I want they should be. Send them off.Benevolence says, 'convert Africa to Christ.' Benevolence aims at one object the conversion of Africa to Christ. Prejudice aims at another the removal of the people of color. Can both objects be secured at the same time and by the same means? Can benevolence secure her end at the same time and by the same means by which prejudice secures hers? Can Christ and Belial enter into copartnership and each have his own way and secure his own ends?If Africa is to be christianized, it must be done by appropriate means. What madness to think of doing it by IN appropriate means!  Who would send the ignorant and degraded the dregs of society to do it: If done at all, then, it must be done, (1) by means of colored and other missionaries and teachers, qualified for the work here in America, and going forth to it as the spirit of Christ; and (2), if the colony at Liberia is to aid in this work, it must be increased SLOWLY, and by the addition of such persons and such only, as are DISPOSED and QUALIFIED to aid it. In a word, it must be strictly and truly the handmaid of benevolence and not the great lazar-house of prejudice, into which it is to empty its victims by thousands. In this way Benevolence might secure her object.If Prejudice is to have her way and secure her object then the colored people, unfit (as the Colonization Society declares) to remain, and incapable of being elevated here these, the dregs of society, are to be and must be disgorged by thousands on the shores of Africa!! Yes prejudice must disgorge herself of more than SIXTY THOUSAND** of her victims every year, for many years to come, or she can never secure her object and get her hated victims out of the way. But let her put into her colony at Liberia only one thousand a year and the colony is ruined and the ends of benevolence defeated. Set down 1000 new emigrants a year into that thriving seaport. New Bedford could New Bedford live? The town would be a state pauper in five years. THE COLONY IS GROWING TOO FAST NOW. Make it then the open receptacle of Prejudice's countless victims, and it ceases to be the handmaid of benevolence, and becomes the lazar-house of prejudice, the curse of curses to oppressed and bleeding Africa.For these and other similar reasons, I have been constrained to withdraw my confidence and co-operation from this scheme. It is a scheme, in which I was once deeply interested. I have spoken, and preached, and written, and taken contributions in its behalf. I did not then understand the real nature and tendency of the scheme. I meant well in espousing it, but I now see my error and my sin; and though it was a sin of ignorance, still I desire to repent of it, and to send out this little book, to speak for the oppressed and vindicate their cause, that I may thereby do something, to make reparation for the injury done by former neglect and error.

 'Ridicule and reproach have been abundantly heaped upon the laborers in this righteous cause. Power, wealth, talent, pride, and sophistry, are all in arms against them; but God and truth are on their side. The cause ofanti-slavery is rapidly gaining ground. Wise heads as well as warm hearts, are joining in its support. In a few years I believe the opinion of New England will be unanimous in its favor. Those who are determined to be on the popular side, should be cautious how they more just now: It is a trying time for such characters, when public opinion is on the verge of a great change.''The only true courage is that which impels us to do right without regard to consequences.

       To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Court assembled:Your Memorialist begs leave to represent, that he has for more than twenty years performed the service of a Missionary in the Plantation of Marshpee, where he has exercised his ministry in peace, except that in the course of the last year a party has risen up, composing of another denomination, who have attempted to usurp the occupancy of the parsonage, wood land, and also the meeting house, both of which have always been held for congregational use: This is therefore to pray the Court, that said Missionary be protected in his privileges, and that, for the common safety, a good and sufficient government may be continued for the inhabitants of the said plantation. And as in duty bound will ever pray, your humble petitioner,  To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Court assembled:      PHINEAS FISH,   Missionary to the Indians of Marshpee.Marshpee, December 30, 1833.Twenty-seven heads of families and six others, hereto annexed, unite in wishing my continuance in my office and the enjoyment of my privileges.  Missionary to the Indians of Marshpee        PHINEAS FISH.   To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Court assembled:We, the subscribers, inhabitants and proprietors of the Plantation of Marshpee, heads of families and individuals, respectfully shew, That, whereas unjustifiable and riotous attempts have been made to take away our meeting house and to remove from his office of religious teacher among us, our pastor, Rev. Phineas Fish, we beg leave to represent, that we are well satisfied with him, and we hereby humbly petition that our pastor may be protected in the peaceable possession of his accustomed privileges, and be continued to labor among us, as in times past. And, as in duty bound, will ever pray.  To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Court assembled:      NATHAN POCKNET,      and Thirty-five others. and Thirty-five others      To the Honorable the Senate and the Honorable the House of Representatives, in General Court assembled:We, the subscribers, proprietors and inhabitants of the Plantation of Marshpee, respectfully represent, that we have been informed, that a portion of our tribe, led on by one Apes, a Pequot Indian, who has lately come among us, are about to petition the General Court, for a repeal of the laws and regulations respecting Marshpee Plantation, so that we may manage our own affairs in our own way.This Apes, pursuant to his intention to change the government of Marshpee and render himself absolute on the plantation, has moved his family on our lands, and gathered around him individuals like himself, and assumed the whole management of our concerns. He first prevailed on individuals to dismiss our excellent minister, the Rev. Mr. Fish, who was settled over us by the government, and whose salary is chiefly paid by funds under the direction of Harvard University, and forbid that institution paying him any further salary. He then, with his followers, proceeded to dismiss the Board of Overseers, appointed by the government, and threatened to throw them from the plantation, if they came on it to interfere with his orders or arrangements. He then, with his followers, proceeded to prevent the execution of contracts made by the Overseers, in the sale of wood from the plantation, for our support, and riotously prevented the delivery of the wood and taking it away by those to whom it was lawfully sold.This unprecedented impudence was immediately communicated to His Excellency the Governor, who promptly sent one of his council, the Hon. Mr. Fiske, to inquire into these proceedings, and make report. This Apes, with two or three of his followers, were apprehended on a warrant, indicted by the Grand Jury for the County of Barnstable, convicted by a Traverse Jury at the September term of said Court, imprisoned by the Court for a riot: and after suffering the punishment inflicted by the Court, have returned to the plantation, probably ready for new scenes of riot and mischief. Apes, while in prison, is said to have drawn a lengthy petition to the Legislature, to be presented at their present session, the contents of which have yet transpired: but if the natives will sign it, will be produced. The report is, that the petitioners pray, that the laws respecting the guardianship of the Indians in Marshpee, may be repealed, and they permitted to manage their own affairs in their own way, or in other words, that he may manage them: that our excellent minister may be dismissed: our guardians discharged, and the individuals permitted to dispose of their property as they shall see fit. To these propositions (if true) we most respectfully remonstrate, and believe, if they were granted, not a foot of land would remain to the natives of the plantation, in ten years from this time.We state, without the fear of contradiction, that the Plantation of Marshpee was never more prosperous and happy, than before this Apes came among us. Our resources have been well managed, our poor have been well provided for, our sick well attended, and the bills for medicine and attendance, of all unable to pay, promptly discharged by our Overseers: our schools have been kept both Summer and Winter, on the plantation, and school houses have been erected, and built, by the munificence of the government, and our poor 'have had the gospel preached to them, without money and without price.' We are not in debt we live within our means we have as much care taken of us as we need, and as much liberty as we know what to do with; we are, therefore, totally averse to any change in the government of Marshpee, and desire no additional act, except a power to be granted to our Overseers, to remove nuisances from the plantation, who come to disturb our repose, and subvert those laws and regulations which our fathers before us highly prized, and which, till of late, we have quietly enjoyed.Years of experience have taught us, and convinced respectable committees appointed to consider our situation, that no better regulations can be made for the government of Marshpee, than what now exist; and for a proof of the truth of this remonstrance, and the things we state to be facts, we respectfully ask the General Court to inquire of the Hon. Mr. Fiske, of whose report we have never heard a word, but being agent for the government, sent to inquire into our situation, who with much pains sought into the various subjects of complaint, made by Apes and his followers, is well qualified fairly to represent our true state and condition.And, as in duty bound, will every pray.  To the Honorable the Senate and the Honorable the House of Representatives, in General Court assembled:       remonstrate,          NATHAN POCKNET,and Fifty-one others.   and Fifty-one others.

It is a case of rare and peculiar merit; and those who are desirous not only of witnessing the improvement of the colored children of this city, but also of aiding their elevation, are respectfully invited to be present.

Price 50 cents.This work is one of the best, if not the very best among the numerous publications which have appeared in defence of the doctrines and measures of abolitionists. It contains the sanction of ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR CLERGYMEN, of various denominations, to the doctrine of IMMEDIATE ABOLITION. It is extremely pungent, argumentative, and comprehensive, and deserves a place in every family in the United States.  Lectures on Slavery and its Remedy.    .      DECLARATION OF SENTIMENT.ADDRESS TO CLERGYMAN.LECTURE I. The sin of slavery question stated; slavery defined; definition exclaimed and illustrated; the question not one of mere abstraction; slavery in all cases, either is or is not sin; it is in all cases, falsehood in theory; tyranny in practice; a violation of God's law; and a parent of abominations originating and perpetuating the foreign slave-trade, with all its connected sins and woes; also the domestic; and being the fruitful source of licentiousness.LECTURE II. Objections Answered and slavery shown to be, I, not peculiar in the United States in respect to its innocence and the difficulties of its removal; 2, not sanctioned by the bible; 3, that the slave is not unqualified for freedom; 4, that slavery is not entailed, so as to cancel or diminish guilt.LECTURE III. The Remedy of Slavery. The subject undergoing a new and thorough investigation; the people of the North better qualified to judge on the question of remedy than are the people of the South; the remedy, whatever it be, is to be determined on general principles, and not on the supposition of excepted cases; it most respect the rights and interests of the injured, in preference to those of the injurers; it is, complete and universal emancipation. This is to be effected, not by any schemes of amelioration; not by any schemes of gradual emancipation; but by that of immediate emancipation. The scheme explained; the mode and plan for carrying it into effect stated.LECTURE IV. Objections Answered. The scheme of Immediate Emancipation shown, I, not to be fraught with danger to the nation; nor 2, with danger to the master's life; not 3, with danger to his interest; nor 4, with ruin to the slave; nor 5, with what some regard as most horrible, amalgamation.

 MR. SOUTHARD'S SCHOOL. It will be seen by his advertisements, that this gentleman has opened a private school for the instruction of the colored youth of this city. He is too well known here, by his active exertions to advance the happiness and respectability of the colored population in this country, to be essentially benefitted by any panegyric of ours. It is pertinent simply to observe, that his school is very much needed that he is in all respects qualified to make it worthy of liberal patronage that his soul is in the enterprise and that he is a thorough-going abolitionist.

       AMERICAN COLONIZATION SOCIETY. It appears that this old handmaid of slavery, by her profligacy and extravagance, is now involved to the amount of FORTY-SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS! This is the Society which boasts of having been so essentially benefitted by the opposition of abolitionists! Fresh benefits will be conferred as fast as we can issue the Liberator. This is advancing backwards, and getting the Irishman's hoist, a peg lower, with a vengeance. Now, down with your mites there is a 'dead horse' to be taken out of the way which is to cost only          

              Oh, Thou! who dost with equal eye All human kind survey,And mad'st all nations of the earth From the same mass of clay;If pity in thy nature dwell, Behold our race forlorn;Behold us from our native soil, From wives, from children torn!Chained in the ship's dark, scanty room, Behold us pant for breath,Envying those friends, who, happier far, Exchange their bonds for death.Behold us in the sun's fierce blaze Struggling with toil and pain!Behold us sink beneath the task, Expiring on the plain!And who are they who dare torment The creatures of Thy hand?And with a brother's blood, like Cain, Pollute both sea and land?Ah! 't is a race that falsely boast Salvation through His name,Who taught, 'What ye wish men to do, Do ye the same to them.'Yet vengeance is not our request, We ask but liberty;And light sufficient to explore The way that leads to Thee.If these in mercy Thou bestow, O! may Thy bounty moveOur hearts, our minds, our souls, to glow With gratitude and love.                                           

       A letter from Washington, published in the Recorder of this morning, giving an account of the colonization meeting in that city, says'The whole character of the meeting was altogether more anti-slavery than I anticipated even as much as I could desire. It ought to satisfy all the abolitionists.'If it 'ought to satisfy all the abolitionists,' then, of course, it was distinguished for 'fanaticism,' 'cant,' 'abuse of slaveholders,' 'incendiary doctrines,' &c. &c.!! Truly, abolitionism is borne along on the full tide of popularity. Why does not the Recorder denounce that meeting?    more anti-slavery than I anticipated It ought to satisfy all the abolitionists.   all the   

       The following lines were written by a young and intelligent lady of color, who, with the other members of the family to which she belongs, has by her perseverance in study, &c. forced the respect even of those who would wish to crush the people of color to the earth. May her appeal not be in vain!       Oh, woman, woman, in thy brightest hourOf conscious worth, of pride, of conscious power,Oh, nobly dare to act a Christian's part,That well befits a lovely woman's heart!Dare to be good, as thou canst dare be great;Despise the taunts of envy, scorn and bate;Our 'skins may differ,' but from thee we claimA sister's privilege, in a sister's name.We are thy sisters, God has truly said,That of one blood, the nations he has made.Oh, christian woman, in a christian land,Canst thou unblushing read this great command?Suffer the wrongs which wring our inmost heartTo draw one throb of pity on thy part;Our 'skins may differ,' but from thee we claimA sister's privilege, in a sister's name.Oh, woman! though upon thy fairer browThe hues of roses and of lilies glowThese soon must wither in their kindred earth,From whence the fair and dark have equal birth.Let a bright halo o'er thy virtues shedA lustre, that shall live when thou art dead;Let coming ages learn to bless thy nameUpon the altar of immortal fame.                              ADA.     

       At the above meeting, the Rev. Mr. Breckenridge made a speech, which was received with alternate hisses and applause, and in which, according to the statement of a correspondent of the New-York Observer, 'he concluded that the Society STOOD IN THE BREACH BETWEEN THE ABOLITIONISTS AND THE SLAVEHOLDERS, and that the moment it should be put down, or cease to occupy that station, the abolitionists would be upon them, united with all others in the country; and that it was, therefore, their true policy to uphold the Society with all their might.'This sustains the great and fundamental accusation which we have constantly alleged against the Society that it is THE WALL WHICH SURROUNDS THE SLAVE STATES, high and massive, and it must be levelled to the earth before deliverance can be given to the slaves. Thanks be to God, it is tottering to its fall!  that the moment it should be put down, or cease to occupy that station, the abolitionists would be upon them, united with all others in the country;     

       She hath her wish, for which in vain She pined in restless dreams'Oh mother! is this home again? How desolate it seems!Yet all the dear, familiar things Look as they did of yore;But oh! the change this sad heart brings, This is my home no more!'I left thee! like the dove of old, I left thy parent breast,But on life's waste of waters cold My soul hath found no rest!And back the weary bird is come, Its woes its wanderings o'er;Ne'er from the holy ark to roam Yet this is home no more!Oh mother, sing my childhood songs! They fall like summer's rainOn this worn heart, that vainly longs To be all thine again!Speak comfort to me! call me yet Thy Mary as of yore;Those words could make me half forget That this is home no more!'Sit near me! Oh this hour repays Long years of lonely pain;I feel as if the old bright days Were all come back again!My heart beats thick with happy dreams Mine eyes with tears run o'er!Thou'rt with me, mother! Oh it seems Like home! our home once more!'Oh home and mother, can ye not Give back my heart's glad youth?The visions which my soul forgot, Or learnt to doubt their truth!Give back my childhood's peaceful sleep, Its aimless hopes restore!Ye cannot! mother, let me weep For this is home no more!'Thou mourner for departed dreams! On earth there is no restWhen grief hath troubled the pure streams Of memory in thy breast!A shadow on thy path shall lie Where sunshine laughed before:Look upwards to the happy sky! Earth is thy home no more!                       all   Thy            our                      

       At the same meeting Gerrit Smith, (one of the pillars of the Colonization Society) 'lamented that the measures and language of the Society had not been marked with more love for the colored population, had seemed rather to view them as a nuisance, to be gotten rid of.'This proves another allegation of ours that the measures of the Colonization Society have not been marked with love for the colored population, and that it has branded those as a 'nuisance' here, whom it has sent forth professedly to civilize and evangelize Africa!  had not been marked with more love for the colored population, nuisance,     

         This' is a metrical version of the Weissenbrun Hymn, so called from its discovery in a manuscript belonging to the convent of that place in Franconia, supposed to be of the eighth century. The original Teutonic, with an Anglo-Saxon, and a literal English version is given by the late Rev. and excellent J.J. Conybeare, in his 'Illustrations of Anglo-Saxon Poetry.'This I've heard from ancient sages,Men the chief of elder ages,That in time of old gone by,There was not the heaven on highHeaven on high, nor earth below;Then nor star was seen to glow;Nor the sun was shining bright;Nor the moon gave forth her light;Nor was mountain then, nor tree;Nor the interminable sea;Of this universal roundNot a whit from bound to bound.But though lower world was none,Yet there wanted not the oneAlmighty God in being then,He, most merciful to men!And with him there were of oldGodlike spirits manifold.Holy God Almighty, ThouHeaven and earth hast fashioned now,And Thy creature man dost blessWith provisions numberless:Me Thy way in mercy show,And on me Thy grace bestow.Faith, to Thy pure truth resigned;Prompt to serve a willing mind;Prudent heart, and active hand,Craft of Satan to withstand;Evil ever to eschew,And Thy will, O God, to do.                                        

       Among the speakers on the above occasion was Elliott Cresson, who, for his monstrous misrepresentations and vile personalities, was compelled to leave England in disgrace. In his speech, (says the N.Y. Observer,) he 'positively contradicted the report that the lamented Wilberforce had died an enemy to the Society'!! This is, indeed, the climax of audacity, enough to raise a blush even upon a face of bronze. Although Wilberforce signed, a short time before his death, duplicate copies of a solemn Protest against the American Colonization Society, in which it is declared that the Society 'is an obstruction to the abolition of slavery throughout the world,' yet he was not 'an enemy to the Society!' O, no! Give us the testimony of Cresson to that of Wilberforce! Mr. C. seems determined on gathering a new harvest of infamy in England. The falsehood which he has dared to utter, respecting a sainted philanthropist, shall not fail to be known in that country.  throughout the world,'   

         To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Court assembled:Where it is expected, by the inhabitants of this Commonwealth, that justice and equity will reign in the hearts of all that national prejudices and peculiar feelings, attending religionists, will not be permitted to rule the hearts of any but, that every enlightened and judicious Representative, as we trust they all are that compose this Body, will be willing to do as they would wish to be done by; and we wish this Honorable Body to consider our oppression. While ye are filled with the fat of our fathers' land, and enjoy your liberties without molestation, will not this Honorable Body be as benevolent to us, poor Marshpee Indians, who are sighing and weeping under bondage, as ye are to the poor Cherokees? and have we not groaned under the weight of degradation long enough? Are ye willing that we should go down to the grave with sorrow and disgrace, as our fathers have before us, when we are willing to try to take care of ourselves? And we fear that our petitions have been laid aside without much notice heretofore; and our complaints that come before common Courts, as well as this Honorable Body, have been looked at as being mere cyphers. But we hope that this indifferent spirit is dying away, and that the true spirit of the Christian philanthropist is beginning to reign in the hearts of the people, and those who compose their Legislative Bodies. If so, may we not expect to share a part, although we are looked upon to be but poor and insignificant creatures? And why are we so? Because we have not had the opportunity; no particular pains have been taken to instruct us; we are wanting the same privilege that your Honors have, in order to make us what we ought to be, good and wholesome citizens; and we do say that we can never rise to a state of cultivation, under existing circumstances. We can assure your Honors that there is not one enlightened and respectable Indian upon the plantation, that wants Overseers or the present minister, Mr. Phineas Fish. We say that all of our rulers, and he who is said to be our preacher, were placed here amongst us without our consent; and it has been the policy of these interested men to work upon the feelings of some of our most ignorant and dissipated men and women, to keep us divided. We are sure that none but those who are in the habit of drinking, and such as do not attend meeting any where, would, or have signed his paper, to hear him preach; and many of them have said they did not know what it contained. Why we mention this, is, because we have discharged him, and passed Resolutions that we will not hear him preach; and we are of the same mind still. We do not believe he cares any thing for our souls, but the fleece we believe he loves well. If he did care for us, we believe that twenty years would have been long enough to have secured our confidence, and reared to himself a respectable church and society; but he has not a male member belonging to his church that has one drop of the royal, or real native blood in him. We therefore wish to have him removed peaceably from our borders, by this Honorable Body, who we believe will try to do us justice, especially when your Honors hear the Bill of Complaints, laid before you by us, your humble petitioners, the Marshpee Indians.  To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Court assembled:      Bill of Complaints.   Honored Gentlemen:It is not possible for us to give you a full statement of wrongs that we have to suffer, in consequence of having Overseers to manage for us, who, we believe, felt more interested for themselves than for us; and we purpose only to give you a few statements of facts, such as generally can be sustained by us, whose fathers were the original proprietors of the soil where this stately edifice now stands, and whose laws have ground us to the dust.First: We are certain that the Marshpee Government is unconstitutional, and far transcends the Constitution of the country, and of course is extremely defective and injurious to us as a people.This law was imposed upon us by the consent of a few of our forefathers, aided by the designing white man, whose artful voice inspired in their breasts cheering hopes that their property should be secured to them, and they one day should be equalized and respected with the white man; for we have no idea that our fathers would have bound us, so as to take away all of our rights from us, for Indians have too much affection for each other, to use that kind of treachery towards their children. We believe they would as soon given up their own lives, but for the promise of bettering their condition, and that of their children. But since our fathers fell asleep, we have heard but little about law or liberty, or any thing else, but imposition upon the back of imposition, and in the following manner:We have been obliged to submit to a hereditary government, as we believe, son succeeding father, and brothers, brothers, to the Overseership: for this lineage of government has been kept up for nearly forty years, and we think it is time for a change. Neither do we think it right for us to abide by an unconstitutional law, made by our fathers forty years ago, and others, meaning the whites, who had their own interest in view, we believe, altogether for our sufferings by that law have been immense.For we as a people have not been permitted to worship God according to our own views and feelings, and as conscience dictated us; for the preacher that was placed among us was altogether by the power of the Overseers, without asking one of us whether we would like to have him or no, and of course ordained without the particular knowledge of us to be supported out of our property for life, without being any service to us, or our consent to have it so. Is the like known any where amongst other towns in this State peopled by white men? This preacher has moved principally amongst white people, and taught them, whilst we have been compelled to support him, and sigh in bondage; and the presumption is, that the whites have had three times the benefit of the preacher and our funds, that we have ourselves.This government also admits two ministerial farms upon our plantation, occupied by Phineas Fish and Gideon Holly. Mr. Holly succeeded his father, who was Preacher and Overseer the latter now being Overseer and these two gentlemen occupy about fifteen hundred acres of our best land, and do us no essential service whatever, but contrarywise, a bill of expense, and as destructive to us as a famine would be, in gradually wasting away the people before it.We have been kept out of our own meeting house and school houses till very recently; have had no privileges to hold any kind of meetings in them, although we should have been glad to have done something to improve our minds, in the way of meetings, either for debating societies or the worship of God; and our meeting house has been vacated for nearly ten years by most all of our people. We have no idea it would average ten of a Sabbath, and our meeting house is almost worn out by white people. It is not actually fit for respectable people to meet in. When we wanted a meeting for the benefit of the town, the Overseers have appointed them in other towns, and incurred a large bill of expense in this way, while they have insulted and pushed us out of doors: our women and our widows neglected, and our orphan children crying for bread. The expense has been very great in this way of doing business, for they (the Overseers) generally had a fine dinner, and we believe the expense came altogether out of our funds. The General Court provides but three for us to pay, but they (the Overseers) provide three or four more for us to pay, and they all find such good picking, they are loth to leave us; but we should rather not maintain them any longer, for we do not see that they are any service to us in raising us in the world; but we find the same deep stain of degradation hanging upon our persons and property, all apparently devoted to the will of unholy and unprincipled men, that prowl around our borders.This present government admits all the scum of the white population amongst us that cannot remain in those towns where your Honors dwell, and our young people are not slow to learn their vices; and it is impossible, under existing laws, to have it otherwise. It also admits those characters to more privileges upon our lands than ourselves, and if we say a word, we are then made out highway robbers, condemned, and hauled to the prison, and calumniated to the foulest extent by those very persons, who, we believe, have reaped the benefit of our property.It furthermore withholds from us the necessaries of life that many of our people might enjoy; for it is a fact, that it gives power to the Overseers to take from us our grain if they choose, which they in fact have done. Whilst their husbands were absent at sea, our wives, and mothers, and sisters, would go to the Overseers for assistance. Sometimes they would hear, and at other times they would not; and when they did, they would give them a writing or order for the value of twenty-five or fifty cents, and then send them nine or ten miles to procure the value of it, and this as often as they go. We set too much by our women and children to have them served in this way any longer.It also spoils our fishing, for white people think they have as good a right to our plantations and fishing privileges as ourselves, and of course throng us, and injure us all more or less.This law also declares our whole plantation to be a public highway, and the inhabitants to be thieves and robbers, according to the plea made by Mr. Warren, the District Attorney, appointed by the Governor and Council; and this too, for merely inquiring into our rights, and shuts us up in prison. This law discourages our people, so that many of them have left their homes, and say they will not live under such oppressive laws, (the Overseers never encouraging industry,) and we believe it is the design of the Overseers so to oppress us as to drive all our people from the plantation. So that this law only adds disgrace to disgrace, and grinds us to the dust. The Overseers have also incurred many needless expenses by hiring other houses to have our meetings in, when we had them of our own, and appointed several men to do our business, and paid them out of our funds, when we might have done it ourselves; such as mending roads, carting wood, it being far from market, and by the time the poor got it there who had no team of their own, they had but little indeed left for themselves.There are several tons of our most excellent ship timber that is cut and carried off yearly, and other valuable timber that we do not want cut; for we do not know but we shall want to build a ship ourselves, if we get able; and if not, we want the profit of it, for we have never learnt that any account has been rendered for any of it, to any one. Our cedar swamps share the same fate. Many of our most enlightened and virtuous men have been and cut and corded wood for themselves, and the Overseers have taken it from us, and sold it to whom they pleased; and even torn our fencing stuff from our fences, and carried it off, and sold it, and all the satisfaction we could get was, hold your peace, or you shall have nothing. This law admits just as much wood as the Overseers are a mind to cut and sell, and we believe it will average yearly, not less than twelve hundred cords per year of cord wood, besides other wood that is sold for fires around about us; and if we want any, we have to pay one dollar per cord for pine wood, and one dollar fifty cents for oak, out of our commons, and then sell it to just such men as the Overseers say, and to no others; and we think that such a tax is enormous, to pay for our own wood.It also admits the white people to take away from our meadows all the hay, if they choose, leaving only enough for one cow, if any of us happen to have one; and if we have any more stock, we have to go ten or twelve miles to cut hay upon shares, or buy it. This we are compelled to do, or our cattle must suffer and die; and from these men we have no encouragement to raise stock, or be enterprising in any way whatever. It also admits the white people to greater privileges in possessing our pastures, than ourselves; for our wood, and hay, and pastures, are all set up at auction, and the white people have the means to out-bid us, and take every thing from us; and the Overseers will not give us any chance, for our lives, in these things. As to the poor, we are all poor together; for we, in general, take care of ourselves in farming, hunting, fishing, and some in going to sea. We have some poor that are not able to maintain themselves. The Overseers assist a little in helping us to take care of them, but if we did not help them they must suffer; and in the manner things are conducted, it makes it hard for all. If things were conducted differently, it would make it easy for all; but we cannot have it otherwise under present laws and task-masters, although we believe there has been enough to maintain our poor, and if we had what has been squandered, as we believe from circumstantial evidence, we all should be in a better condition than we are now.How much the proceeds of our plantation would amount to, yearly, we are not able to give an accurate account, but from circumstances that we have had before us, we think we can come somewhere near it. We will say twelve hundred cords of wood, at nine shillings per cord, amount to eighteen hundred dollars; two hundred tons of hay, at four dollars per ton, amount to eight hundred dollars; there are twelve farms, at fourteen dollars per farm, amount to one hundred and sixty eight dollars; we have much pasture, we will say one hundred dollars for that, although we think we are within bounds; ship timber, we will put one hundred more; the whole amounting to twenty nine hundred and sixty eight dollars. We think the property ought to fetch that, certainly.How much our expenses would be, when all told, we are not able to account accurately, but we believe we can come very near it. Our schools are kept in the following manner: in the winter we have two, the teachers receiving pay from twelve to fourteen dollars for three months each; in the summer we have two female teachers, they receiving one dollar per week for about sixteen weeks, making one hundred and ten dollars. There are seven poor, we believe, assisted by the Overseers; three are supported principally from the fund; for them is paid one dollar per week out of the funds, the others receive from two shillings to fifty cents, making about two hundred and fifty six dollars for their table expenses. As to clothing, they get but a little; they get a suit of coarse factory cloth, amounts to four or five dollars per suit, we will say thirty dollars; the Overseers let us have a few boards and shingles, to stop a few holes in our old houses, we would say it would be one hundred and fifty per year. We have a doctor that comes amongst us; we should presume he received about seventy five per year. The Overseers pay out of our funds about twenty five dollars per year, for mending roads; the whole of the expenses amounting to six hundred and forty six dollars per year.We think there is a great contrast between our expenses and the income of our plantation. But how much the Overseers charge for their services we know not, (we presume they take care of themselves) but they take the remainder the funds are generally all away.And now, Honored Gentlemen, we think we have been in slavery long enough. As to the Overseers, we have no confidence in them whatever we do not believe they have dealt honestly by us, and we believe if they have a mind to swindle, none has a better chance than themselves, for they keep debt and credit, and how easy it is for them to conspire together to do us wrong, if they choose! At any rate, after suffering so much, we are jealous of them, and do assure your Honors we want them no longer. The Overseers say there is a general satisfaction amongst us, and that the excitement is of recent date. But we say, for more than five years there has been a very great dissatisfaction amongst us, and if we should add five more to it, it would be nothing out of the way: and it appears from the movements of the Overseers, that their influence in past times respecting our petitions, has been against us that we have been represented as being a set of indolent, drunken Indians; but we say it is not the case for many, very many of our people, are temperate, and sober, and industrious, and are willing to do, if they (the Overseers) would not prevent us. And now, if we wish to take care of ourselves, we cannot see why we may not have that privilege.We presume the above charges and complaints are sufficient to warrant us a redress, and the abrogation of an unconstitutional law. If not, we have no doubt but the Overseers would strip us of all our living in five years more; and we have no doubt but it was the intention of the Overseers to strip us from our all; and we most solemnly believe we have been wronged out of thousands and tens of thousands of dollars in the course of this Overseership every man seeking his own wealth instead of another man's.Honor to whom honor is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear; and we would render therefore unto Caesar the things that belong to Caesar, and unto God the things that are God's.Therefore we can say there is one item in the law that is good that is this: that no one should be permitted to sell his land without a mutual consent, and we wish that item still to be retained for a few years, till our people become more enlightened, for many of them are ignorant in making trades, although we are happy to state to this Honorable Body, that we have many who are capable of doing business any where, and any kind of common and merchantable or seafaring business to navigate a ship to any part of the globe.And now we want a chance to instruct those who are ignorant, before that item is removed, for there are many that would not hesitate to strip us, who are ignorant, of our last morsel and we shall consider it a favor indeed to have that item remain, and give us a chance for our lives in acting for ourselves.And we do not want Overseers as for them, we want them discharged, and never want their names mentioned amongst us again. And we would say of the preacher, Mr. Fish, we think no more of him than we do of the Overseers, believing they are all linked in together; and we want him discharged, for we want our house to meet in ourselves.Yours Most Obediently,                                                    THE MARSHPEE INDIANS.      We, the Marshpee Tribe,   Also pray for a grant of the liberties of the Constitution, to form a Municipal Code of Laws amongst ourselves, that we may have a government that will be useful to us as a people; for we are sure we have never had any since our original Sachem fathers fell asleep.Also, we desire that this Honorable Body would grant us the privilege of choosing an Attorney, to advise with us in our municipal regulations, and to instruct us still further in the laws; and this gentleman to be chosen yearly, or as long as we may deem it proper for the safety of the Town, and to be supported out of our funds (his expenses.)We wish that some provision could be made for the appointment of one or two Magistrates amongst us.We also pray, that our Town may be incorporated and called Marshpee.We have made these requests, believing the white men are knowing to our oppression in the general; and that if such laws are still enforced upon us, it is still murdering us by inches. And we do not know why the people of this Commonwealth want to cruelize us any longer, for we are sure that our fathers fought, bled, and died for the liberties of their now weeping and suffering children, the same as did your fathers for their children, whom ye are, who are now sitting to make laws to suit your own convenience, and secure your liberties. Oh, white man! white man! the blood of our fathers, spilt in the Revolutionary War, cries from the ground of our native soil, to break the chains of oppression, and let our children go free.Yours we are, most respectfully,          fought, bled, and died for the liberties Oh, white man! white man! go free      THE MARSHPEE INDIANS.

 MARSHPEE INDIANS. The Memorial of this tribe, praying to be emancipated from the fetters of guardianship, and one of an opposite character, are inserted in this week's paper. Our readers are requested to give them a careful perusal. We have no space for remarks.     

            The laws which regulate this remnant of a once powerful tribe of Indians, are not familiar to many, and it is one great defect in the present system, that these laws are so difficult of access, and so complex that the Indians neither know nor comprehend them; and it cannot be expected that they should live contentedly under oppressive regulations which they do not understand. Should any new laws be passed, they ought to be as simple as possible, and distributed for the use of the Indians.By the Act of 1788, Ch. 38, Vol. 1. of Laws, 342, new provisions were made, the previous act 1788, Ch. 2. being found insufficient 'to protect them and their property against the arts and designs of those who may be disposed to take advantage of their weakness.' The wisdom of the whites, at that time, invented the following provisions for that purpose:Sec. 1. A Board of five Overseers was established (afterwards reduced to three) two to be inhabitants of Barnstable, county and three from an adjoining country. (Now two are inhabitants of Barnstable and one of Plymouth County.) These Overseers were vested with full power to regulate the police of the plantation to establish rules for managing the affairs, interests and concerns of the Indians and inhabitants. They may improve and lease the lands of the Indians, and their tenements; regulate their streams, ponds and fisheries, mete out lots for their particular improvement control and regulate absolutely, their bargains, contracts, wages, and other dealings, take care of their poor, and bind out their children to suitable persons.The Overseers are directed to hold stated meetings, elect a moderator, secretary and treasurer, and may appoint and remove guardians over any of the Indians, to act under the overseers, and to carry their regulations into effect, the guardians to give bonds to the Overseers.By section 2. the Overseers or the guardians they appoint, have power to demand and receive all property or wages owing to said Proprietors or any of them, by any person, and may sue in their own names for its recovery, or for any trespass, fraud or injury done to their lands or them. They may settle all accounts and controversy between the Indians or any white person, for voyages or any services done by them, and may bind the children of poor proprietors by indenture, to suitable persons.Sec. 3. No lease, covenant, bond or bargain, or contract in writing, is of any validity unless approved by the overseers or guardian and no Indian proprietor can be sued for any goods sold, services done, &c. or for money, unless the account is first approved by the Overseers.(This, it is said, enables the Overseers to sanction the accounts of those who sell to the Indians upon the expectation of obtaining the favor of the overseers, and opens a door for connivance.)Sec. 4. The Overseers are to keep a fair account of all monies, wages, &c. they receive, and all proceeds of the plantation, and shall distribute to the proprietors their respective shares and dues, after deducting reasonable expense of conducting their business, paying their just debts, (of which their overseers are made the judges) and providing for the sick and indigent, from the common profits, and reserving such sums as can be spared conveniently, for the support of religious instruction, and schooling children. The accounts to be laid before the Governor annually. The Governor and Council appoint the overseers and displace them at pleasure.Sec. 5. The Indian Proprietors are prohibited giving any one liberty to cut wood, timber or hay, to milk pine trees, carry off any ore or grain, or to plant or improve any land or tenement, and no such liberty, unless approved by the overseers, shall bar on action on the part of the overseers to recover. The lands shall not be taken in execution for debt, and an Indian committed for debt may take the poor debtor's oath, his being a proprietor to the contrary notwithstanding.The last act relating to this tribe was passed Feb. 18, 1819, Chap. 105, 2d vol. of Laws, page 487. It provides that no person thereafter shall be a proprietor of the Plantation, except a child or lineal descendant of some proprietor, and in no other way shall this right, as it is called, be acquired. Other inhabitants are called members of the tribe.The overseers are to keep a record of names, or census, of all who are proprietors, of all who are residents or members of the tribe, a return of which is to be made to the Governor the last of December.The Overseers, in addition to all former power, are invested with all the powers and duties of guardians of the Indians, whenever such office of guardian shall be vacant. (A very blind provision, by the way, which it may be as difficult for white men as for Indians to understand.)Any person selling ardent spirits to an Indian, without a permit in writing from the Overseer, from some agent of theirs, or from a respectable physician, may be fined not more than $50, on conviction, and it shall be the duty of the Overseer to give information for prosecuting such offenders.The Overseers may bind out to service, for three years at a time, any proprietor or member of the tribe who in their judgment has become an habitual drunkard and idler, and they may apply his earnings to his own support, his family's or the proprietors, generally, as they think proper.All real estate acquired or purchased by the industry of the proprietors and members, (meaning of course without the limits of the Plantation) shall be their sole property and estate, and may be held or conveyed by deed, will, or otherwise.If any Indian or other person shall cut or take away any wood, timber, or other property, on any lands belonging to the proprietors or members, which is not set off, or if any person not a proprietor or member, shall do the same on lands that have been set off, or commit any other trespass, they shall be fined not over $200, or imprisoned not over two years. The Indians are declared competent witnesses to prove the trespass. No Indian or other person is to cut wood without a permit in writing, signed by two Overseers, expressing the quantity to be cut, at what time and for what purpose, and the permit must be recorded in their proceedings before any wood or timber shall be cut.(Of this provision, the Indians greatly complain, because it gives them no more privilege in cutting their own wood than a stranger has, and because under it, as they say, the Overseers oblige them to pay a dollar or more a cord for all the wood they are permitted to cut, which leaves them little or no profit, and compels the industrious to labor merely for the support of the idle, while the white men, who have their teams, vessels, &c. can buy their permits and cut down the wood of the plantation in great quantities, at much greater profit than the Indian can do, who has nothing but his axe, and must pay these white men a dollar or more for carting his wood, and a dollar or more to the Overseers, thus leaving him not enough to encourage industry. Recently, however, we understand the Overseers have given the Indians more privileges and no white man in allowed to cut their wood.)All accounts of the Overseers are to be annually examined by the Court of Common Pleas for Barnstable, and a copy sent by the Overseers to the Governor.Any action commenced by the Overseers, does not abate by their death, but may be prosecuted by the survivors.All fines, &c. under the act, are to be recovered before Courts in Barnstable County, one half to the informer, and the other to the State. These are all the provisions of the law of 1819, and these are the provisions under which the tribe is governed.      tenements;           paying their just debts   proprietor   right             belonging

 STATE LEGISLATURE. On the presentation of the Memorial of the Marshpee Indians to the House, some objections having been urged against its being then readMr. CUSHING of Dorchester, was not aware that any objections could be made to the reading of the petition, which he considered as a matter of course; nor could he see how a knowledge of the matter could prejudice the House. He presumed this House would not take upon itself to refuse to hear the petition of the humblest individual, and he did not fear that they could not control their minds so far as to be ready to give a fair hearing to the other side.Mr. LINCOLN of Boston was surprized to hear an objection raised to the reading of this petition. It was due to the character of the House and to our native brethren the petitioners, whose agents were here on the floor, that they should be heard, and heart patiently. He hoped that out of respect to ourselves, and from justice to the petitioners, their petition would find every favor, which in justice ought to be extended to it.Mr. TORREY. The petitioners have a constitutional right to be heard. I know not of what value that provision is which gives a right to petition if the House can refuse to hear the petition. They do not ask for action, but to be heard. It can be read and laid on the table. So long as I hold a seat in this House, my hand shall be raised to give a hearing to the humblest individual who presents a petition for redress of grievances.The Speaker put the question, shall the petition be read? and it was carried in the affirmative, nearly every hand in the House being raised. In the negative we saw but five hands. The petition was then read by the Speaker.             

 The attempt to prevent the petition of the Marshpee Indians from being read, was repelled in the House with an unanimity which shews the value the representatives place upon the right of petitioning. The poor Indians are without advice or counsel to aid them, for they have no means to fee Lawyers but they will evidently find firm friends in the House, ready to do them justice. This is no party question. It involves the honon of the State. Let all be done for them that can be wisely done in a spirit of paternal kindness. Let it not be shown that our sympathy for Indians extends only to those from the South, but has no feeling for our own. Boston Daily Advocate.   Boston Daily Advocate.
