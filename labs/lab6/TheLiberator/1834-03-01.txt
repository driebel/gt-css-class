     JAMAICA, (Vt.) Jan. 18, 1834.   DEAR SIR In compliance with the request of the National Anti-Slavery Society, a few of the members of our Society, in this place, held a meeting on the last Monday evening of December, for the purpose of lifting a cry to God in behalf of the suffering people of color in our country. At the close of the meeting, it was resolved that some little time should be spent in obtaining signers to a petition to Congress, for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. In pursuance of the above resolve, a number of days have been spent in this section of country, and you will learn the result of our labor by the number of names annexed to the petition. We wish you, sir, to forward it to Congress as soon as convenient, but not to our ex-President. Mr. Adams, who, in full view of sufferings which would make even the tiger weep, and which, as expressed by the poet, have taught the very rocks the notes of wo, shamefully stood back, neglecting his duty, and that, too, without the least apparent regret or sorrow; but to the man, if such can be found, whose heart swells with unutterable anguish in view of the sufferings of his fellow beings, though they be of a different color from his own, and who, fearless of consequences, will how himself with all his might in vindication of their rights before his country and his God.We should be highly gratified, sir, if some plan could be devised, by which the information, so much needed in this State, could be more extensively circulated. There are but very few Anti-Slavery Societies in the State, and but very few copies of your invaluable paper are circulated; while Mr. Tracy's poisonous sentiments are promulgated in almost every part of the State.(The petitions, accompanying the above letter, contained several hundred signatures, (male and female,) all obtained in the course of a few days in the village of Jamaica and its vicinity. They have been sent to the Hon. Mr. ELLSWORTH at Washington, by whom a large number, of similar petitions have been presented to Congress. Vermont is beginning to show a strong abolition front.] ED. LIB.        

       On the 9th inst. a few individuals who were in favor of the immediate abolition of slavery, without the condition of colonization, met, and formed themselves into a Society.During the meeting, the Declaration of the National Anti-Slavery Convention, and some of the letters addressed to the Convention were read.The principles of our Constitution are briefly contained in the following articles:ART.2. The object of this Society shall be to collect and diffuse information on the true character of slavery, to convince our countrymen of its heinous criminality in the sight of God, to show that the duty, safety and interest of all concerned, requires its abandonment; and take all lawful, moral and religious means to effect a total and immediate abolition of slavery in the United States.ART. 3. This Society shall aim to elevate the character and condition of the people of color, by encouraging their moral, intellectual and religious improvements, by correcting the prejudices of public opinion, and by endeavoring to obtain for our colored fellow citizens, an equality with the whites in civil and religious privileges; but it is not the object of this Society to countenance the oppressed in vindicating their rights by resorting to physical force.After the following resolution was passed, the Society adjourned.Resolved, That an account of the formation of this Society, be forwarded by the Secretary, to the editors of the Liberator and Emancipator.

        MR. EDITOR, I have seen it stated in the last New York papers, that 'Gen. Jones, of Washington city, D.C. has offered his plantation for the purpose of educating African Youth,' and beg to say a word in your paper in regard to it.I am aware that much credit is due to the Northern States, as a people, for the disposition they have always discovered to elevate the character of the nation by GOOD WORKS, but to conceive it possible to raise the character of blacks in any part of the Southern country, or in any way to better their condition in life, under the present state of things, is, in my opinion, visionary and absurd. I remember an effort was made within a few years, in one of the New England cities, to produce such a change of sentiment among the people as was supposed would open the way for establishing a Seminary of learning for blacks, on a scale little inferior to that of the first college in the Union, and, strange as it is, the course adopted produced to a great extent the desired effect; but, fortunately for the credit of the place, the more intelligent part of the community discovered the stratagem, foresaw the consequences, and blasted the schemes of the fanatics who attempted to impose upon them.I cannot, therefore, in view of the fact related, imagine what possible benefit can arise from this philanthropic gentleman's liberality. Nay, I protest against all such courses, believing the period is not remote when the Southern public will unite in crying down such outrages upon good sense as are daily occurring to our eternal disgrace, to say nothing of the destruction of that unanimity of feeling among us which every patriot is bound to cultivate and preserve. Apalachicola Advertiser.

     Extract of another letter from Vermont   'I live in a cold dark region, where the Vermont Chronicle spreads its deadly influence, chilling and blasting all sympathy for the colored man and the slave, except the insignificant few who can be flattered or driven to the inhospitable coast of Africa. Therefore, the little that I can do, is greatly needed in circulating information in my own region.'  Vermont Chronicle    

 The following characteristic letter was addressed to the editor of the New-York Evangelist, in behalf of a gang of religious menstealers whose consciences were wounded by his hard-hearted attacks upon the benevolent system of oppression.    consciences    LYNCHBURG, Dec. 28, 1833.   Dear Brother: I am instructed to ask you to discontinue the Evangelist to the subscribers whose names are on the next page, and if there is any balance due by them, to forward their accounts to me, and the money shall be remitted you. We live in a slaveholding state, and it is due to the society in which we live, to preserve its harmony and peace. The course of the Evangelist upon the subject of slavery we deem injudicious and full of danger to the southern slaveholder: and we believe it will prove the destruction of the cause it has so warmly espoused. This blessed Union, purchased by the blood of our fathers, is to be rent asunder by the slavery question; an event which will be hastened by the imprudence of the friends of immediate emancipation. We are all friends of gradual emancipation and of the colonization scheme; and some of us have liberated a part of our slaves, and are ready to emancipate more, when we can better their condition; but the plan of amalgamating the black and white population of this country is visionary, and never will be accomplished. We value highly the religious character of the Evangelist, and it is painful to give it up; but our duty to the State in which we live, requires that the sacrifice be made. We consider it due to a Christian brother to state the reasons which influenced us in withdrawing our patronage from a paper which he has edited with so much ability and Christian courtesy.  colonization    Yours in the best of bonds,THOMAS A. HOLCOMBE.    (Here follow the names of thirteen of our subscribers.) New York Evangelist.  New York Evangelist   

     MIDDLETOWN, Jan. 22, 1834.   Although absent in body, and although I have sent nothing to you for some time, you may rest assured that my heart is with you in the good cause in which you have faithfully and zealously labored for the last three years. Though the iron-hearted oppressor and his worthless apologist may rail and even persecute and though the powers that be may offer tempting rewards for your life, we trust there is a hand unseen ever ready to shield you from danger. Fear not, for the truth will triumph over error, and the rights of man, although disregarded now, will ere long be respected.The past year has truly been an eventful one. Your late mission has, I trust, been of lasting importance to the cause of freedom throughout the civilized world. I heartily congratulate you on your safe return, and pray that you may be spared to us many years.The cause of truth progresses slowly with us, but its course is sure. Mr. G.W. Denison was with us soon after his return from Philadelphia, and we trust his labors with us will not be lost. He is a stern advocate for our colored friends and the cause of humanity. We need a great many such men. As to the University, I can say but little. There are a few unshaken ones among us, who, though a little fettered by colonization dogmas, only need more light to make them warm friends of immediate abolition. With us, the intrepid and praiseworthy PRUDENCE CRANDALL has some ardent admirers. Amid the persecutions of a worthless mob, she has stood her ground like one who knows the firmness of her cause. She is deservedly one of the constellations of the age. Her efforts will never be forgotten while the name of freedom is pronounced by the true friend of man. Ay, future ages shall look upon her devotedness to colored people with an eye unjaundiced by prejudice. Her name will live when those of her proud oppressors shall be overwhelmed in the oblivious wave that shall sweep over them.The formation of the American Anti-Slavery Society will be an event that will be enrolled in the annals of time as the ushering in of great and cheering movements in the cause of freedom. It would have been gratifying to me to have been present with you at that time, but it was not in my power.      dogmas, only     

       Gales & Seaton (colonizationists) apologise for advertising human beings for sale in the National Intelligencer as follows:'A correspondent, who says he is a subscriber to the Daily paper, remonstrates with us against the insertion of advertisements of those who wish to purchase or to sell slaves; and adds that he sometimes sees in our paper such advertisements as 'A Servant for sale Enquire at this Office.' In this last particular, our correspondent has surely mistaken some other paper; it being a positive rule to have no such reference made to this office. As to the general complaint of our correspondent, we can only say, that we have no partiality for such advertisements; that they relate, however, to the actual state of Society and the Laws; that to exclude them would be of much more injurious tendency to the welfare of the Slave than to the interest of him who buys or sells him(!) If we thought otherwise, our correspondent, we hope, is sufficiently acquainted with us by reputation to know that no paltry consideration of gain would induce us to admit advertisements of that description into our columns.'(!!)    general   

     Extract of a letter from a neighboring town   The anti-slavery cause is most religious and noble worthy of worthier advocates than myself worthy to be pleaded by HIM who requires of every one of his disciples that his righteousness exceed that of the scribes and pharisees (hypocrites) who devoured the houses of the poor, and, for a pretence, made long prayers, &c. and that he do to others what he would esteem it just and kind in them to do to him.The recent developments of the Colonization Society were by no means astounding to me. They were to be expected; and, in my opinion, the great work we shall have to do is to 'let the dead bury their dead,' and to go forward to the duty of pressing, by the most fair and cogent argumentation, the glorious act of emancipation to the duty of setting public opinion right in relation to slavery and its immediate abolition.You have done nobly, my dear sir, hitherto, in exposing the impotency and evil tendency of the now defunct Society. And, I know you will let me say that I desire to see your good powers as ardently directed to the building up of the Anti-Slavery temple, as they have been to the demolition of the old ruinous building which has occupied the site of it. That old building was no Pyramid, Garrison, erected by 'men of black skin and curling hair,' as Herodotus calls the ancient Egyptians; but a precarious shelter thrown up by men far their inferiors. It is time to say of it 'fuit Ilium' minor et recens, and leave it to its long and honorable repose. It is more lovely in death, than it ever was in life REQUIESCAT! Gerrit Smith and Breckenridge will erect its monument, and then turn abolitionists. We must have a good seminary for the blacks; and, if any of our students shall wish to be missionaries to Africa, or other place, the Missionary Societies will send them.  for a pretence   we  'let the dead bury their dead   You have done nobly now defunct me building up temple Pyramid 'men of black skin and curling hair Egyptians their minor  honorable repose.  death Gerrit Smith and Breckenridge then We good seminary wish   

       The annexed advertisement disgraceful to our country and horrible in its spirit is copied from a late Mobile paper. The editor of the New-York Moral Lyceum, (the Rev. Mr. Crosby, a colonizationist,) in copying it, makes the following feeling remark 'The advertiser must be an odd fish'!!  feeling      I have on hand a few negroes, of superior quality, taken to this place for the purpose of selling to the inhabitants of Mobile. Negroes of that kind appear not to be in de[ ]and, and as I intend leaving shortly, I feel disposed to change a few of them for negroes of less character, that may suit the Louisiana market. The bigger the rascal the better, provided their owners are willing to make up in cash what is lacking in good qualities. I can be seen at Ballenger's old house on Joseph-street, where my negroes are. I still have some fine negroes that I will sell for cash.    ALEXANDER PURYEAR.      

          MENDON, Feb. 21, 1834.   To the Editor of the Liberator:SIR An Anti-Slavery Society was formed at Uxbridge, in the meeting-house of the Rev. Mr. Grosvenor, on Tuesday evening, Feb. 18, after an interesting address by Effingham L. Capron. At the meeting, and previously, THREE HUNDRED AND TEN names were subscribed to the Constitution. Most of these were from Uxbridge; a few names from Mendon. The popularity and progress of the cause in this region are wholly unexpected.The names of the officers are as follow:Effingham I. Capron, President; Joshua Capron, Vice President; John M.S. Perry, (Mendon,) Cor. Secretary; Ehenezor P. Dyer, Rec. Secretary; Richard Battey, Treasurer.MANAGERS Amasa Dudley, Edward Foster, Obadi[ ]h Wood, Ephraim Basset, William C.

                 Inconsistency in opinion and conduct may sometimes not be a crime. If the men who signed that solemn instrument, the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776, were such weak men that they could not understand what they subscribed; and, if the same was true of the signers of the Articles of Confederation, agreed to July 9, 1778, and ratified March 1, 1781; and, if the same was true of those who signed the Constitution of the United States Sept. 17, 1787, then the inconsistencies, involved in those three great State papers, may be set down to the score of unintentional mistake.It will not be denied that all of these instruments are intimately related to each other, and in their fundamental principles might well be expected to harmonize. They are the doings of the same community touching the same thing. Sixteen of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were also signers of the Articles of Confederation, and several of them signers of the Constitution.Whatever other changes might naturally take place in the political views of these public agents, or in the community for which they acted, it would not be reasonable to look for any change in relation to the great fundamental doctrine laid down in their Declaration, that 'all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter, or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem mostly to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their DUTY to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.'Our fathers, having declared these 'self evident' principles of political morality to all the world, never made any retraction of any of them; but they went on, under this broad shield, to resist aggression and to throw off the incumbent government, and to establish one of their own choice.Accordingly, in the third article of confederation, they say 'The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defence, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, &c.' But they had only reached the fourth article, when they began to insinuate, for they did not explicitly avow, that however sound was their creed, they did not intend to square their practice by it. With the help of the numerous colored people within the limits of the country, some of whom were already 'free,' they had thrown off an oppressive government; but now they began to make a distinction between 'the free inhabitants' 'the free citizens' 'and some other inhabitants' or 'citizens,' implying that there were among them some 'men' who were not created equal and were not 'endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights (self-evident) among which are life, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.'They do not tell the world that there were any among them but 'free inhabitants, free citizens' and so strong was the impression, made on the minds of foreign nations, by the 'Declaration of Independence,' of the universality of free citizenship in the United States, that, when, afterwards, they heard of slaves in this nation, they were incredulous of the report.No other allusion is made to the subject of slavery in the ARTICLE OF CONFEDERATION than the one already mentioned. But, when the CONSTITUTION was formed, this subject is recognized with a little more distinctness, perhaps.'Representations and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the WHOLE number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, Three Fifths of ALL OTHER PERSONS.' I. Art. III. Sec. Constitution U.S. Here is a strange mixture of freedom and something else, no one can tell what. Who are the 'All other persons?' The CONSTITUTION does not name them does not say whether they are nobles not yet naturalized, or a band of ten thousand Canadians, who, for pastime, step over the line into Vermont, at the time the United States Census is taken, to be counted with 'the Green Mountain Boys,' and then return home, or whether these 'All other persons' are such nondescript persons that they are not a part of the 'All men created equal, endowed by their CREATOR with certain inalienable rights, among which is LIBERTY.' But whoever they are, it is certain, they are 'persons,' not brutes. Their color is not pointed out, or alluded to, in the Constitution. It may be, therefore, that they are white 'persons,' of some sort not to be described. It is a fact, that there are many thousands of slaves, now in the United States, whose fathers are white freemen, but whose mothers are colored people, perhaps black; perhaps, half bloods, or even seven eighths white blood, but these children must be held in slavery, and are, not unfrequently, sold by their masters (their fathers,) from Virginia or other slave States to New Orleans. How much less than white persons are these children? Let the reader be not too incredulous of what has just been stated. 'I testify that which I have seen. 'Ab uno disce omnes.' Perhaps, the reader may be able to guess who the 'all other persons' are, from the cases I have specified; for the common rule of enslavement of persons in this land of freedom is, that the child, without respect of his color, is a slave, if his mother is a slave, whether the father is so or not. If the mother is free, so is her child, though the father is a slave. Parents, stop and consider this rule. Children, look at it. Both parents and children, it is for you to say, whether such slavery shall continue long in this 'land of the free' or be abolished.Not one word is said directly of slavery in the Constitution of the United States. Political interpreters, however, contrive to descry it, under the phrase 'all other persons,' and, probably, it is to be found under this equivocal phrase, which seems to have been adopted on account of the shame our fathers felt in view of American slavery, so inconsistent with, nay so directly at war with the pure principles of the Declaration of Independence. What they were ashamed of, we ought to abandon, as unworthy of our support.There is one other, and only one other clause in the Constitution, which admits of interpretation favorable to the present existence of slavery in this 'land of the free;' and this clause seems to have been drawn with the same consciousness of wrong and dishonor. It is in these words:'No person, held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.' IV. Art. II Sect.But this clause does not necessarily imply that it is a slave who is to be 'delivered up,' &c. The person intended may be a freeman, held by voluntary contract 'to service or labor,' for which he has been paid; and it is absurd to say that 'service or labor is due,' unless it has been paid for, either actually or by agreement. The service or labor of an indented apprentice is due and may be legally demanded, and so of any person who has contracted to perform it.But how is 'service or labor due' to any man, who has never paid any thing for it, nor agreed to do so? I mean, consistently with the righteous principles of the Declaration of Independence; for those principles are, after all, the corner-stone of our government, and agreeably with them ought every word in the Constitution to be interpreted, and, I believe, will yet be, We either hold to those foundation principles, and, therefore, hold that slavery can not, consistently, exist in our country; or we have abandoned those principles, and, to be honest, are bound to declare our abandonment of them to the world. But we profess to adhere to those principles, and, therefore, are sacredly bound to interpret every article of the Constitution, which is built on them, in perfect agreement with them. If we do this, such language in the Constitution as is now tortured to make it signify slavery, means something else, and not slavery. Who will say, then, that the Congress cannot, by authority of the following clause, make a rule by which every inhabitant of the land shall be free? 'THE CONGRESS SHALL HAVE POWER to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.' I. Art. viii Sect. The Declaration of Independence claims that 'LIBERTY' is one of the 'inalienable rights' of 'all men.' If, by any State law, any such right has been alienated, that law is in plain contradiction of the principles on which the Constitution of the United States professes to be established, and is, therefore, unconstitutional and null. Here read another clause of the Constitution, and you will not easily prove me wrong. 'This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made IN PURSUANCE THEREOF, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the SUPREME LAW of the land, and the JUDGES in every State shall be bound thereby, ANYTHING in the Constitution or Laws of any State TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING.' vi. Art. 'The Constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof,' are 'the Supreme Law of the land.' This Constitution is to be interpreted in accordance with the Declaration of Independence. Neither the word slave, nor slavery, nor white, nor black, nor color, is found in the Constitution of the United States. Our Constitution does not, therefore, make us a slaveholding nation; and what need is there of any Convention of the people to amend the Constitution? The people will interpret the Constitution, making their own Declaration of Independence the key or standard of interpretation; and, then, the trouble will be over.Every man ought to be familiar with the Constitution; but it is surprising to witness the general ignorance of the people on this subject. Probably, nine in every ten in New England believe that slavery is expressly established in the Constitution; whereas, at most, it is distinctly alluded to, as any careful reader may see.It is on this account that I have written this communication; and when any of my fellow citizens shall shew me, by illustrating the Constitution by the principles of the Declaration of Independence, that I am wrong, he shall have my thanks. If he shall prove that slavery is recognized in the Constitution, he will prove that that 'Supreme Law' is inconsistent with itself, and with the fundamental principles of government under which we live: he will prove that our practice falsifies our profession.

       Admirable, both in its spirit and composition, and well deserving the attention of our colored friends. The writer of it is unknown to us, (its penmanship resembles that of a female) but we solicit a continuance of favors from the same pen. ED. LIBERATOR.       MR. GARRISON, Will you permit an ardent friend to the colored people, to address them through the medium of your paper?An intimate acquaintance with various classes of our colored population has afforded me an opportunity of studying the character of that interesting people, whom the States of this happy republic have agreed to hold in slavery; its southern portions, by chaining and confining the body the northern, by throwing the bonds of ignorance and superstition over the intellect and heart. I have studied that character with interest and pleasure; I have watched with intense delight the strugglings of genius, against every difficulty which oppression, contempt, and ridicule could devise, and have witnessed exhibitions of mental strength, which prove with the clearness of mathematical demonstration, that intellectual inferiority is not necessarily connected with a colored skin. The idea that it is so, is almost too contemptible for contradiction. But while there is much to admire and love in the character of this injured race, their friends have often observed with pain, exhibitions of unkind and revengeful feelings towards their white brethren. I presume that the inquiry has already arisen to the lips of many a reader Who can wonder at this? I do not wonder at it. I regret it, deeply regret it. I am not inclined to reproach you for it, my colored friends; but I do entreat you, for your own sake, to repress every emotion of resentment towards those whom you call, with justice, your oppressors. It is an undeniable fact, that you are trampled upon and insulted by those who should love and protect you that your rights are wrested from you by a hand that should be stretched out in your defence; but it is equally true, that the indulgence of angry feeling, and the requital of reviling for abuse, will not bring peace to your own bosoms, or obtain for you that treatment which you may justly demand. I have been told, when calmly reasoning on this subject, that those who have not felt the bitterness of contempt, and ridicule, and scorn, are not qualified to judge of the magnitude of the causes, exciting these resentful emotions. I am not unconscious that discouragements of a peculiar nature are thrown around your way that your earliest, brightest hopes are blasted by the chilling frowns of a cruel world that the finest feelings of your souls are lacerated without mercy; but what will heal a broken heart more speedily than patience in suffering, and the exercise of kindness toward those who inflict it? Let the breath that is wasted in denouncing curses on your enemies, be spent in supplicating strength for the endurance of trial; let the energies that lie crushed in your bosoms be aroused to prepare yourselves and your children to enjoy the high privileges of American citizens; and calmly and boldly demand those privileges. Will you not stand forth to the world, a rare example of an injured and insulted people, returning good for evil, and blessing for cursing? Do not be discouraged in your struggle to elevate your rank in society; rest not until the richest clusters from the tree of knowledge are within your grasp; rest not until the light of literature and science has burst with dazzling brightness on your souls, the welcome morning of a long, dark night. The day is not very far distant, when you shall be owned as men and brethren. The God of heaven and earth is not slumbering while men are disregarding his commandments; he will yet appear in your defence. He commands you to leave the execution of vengeance to himself. He will repay this guilty nation with sufficient severity. You are not friendless. Many of the wise and good among us are eloquently pleading your cause, and you have one friend who has not 'counted his life dear unto himself,' so that he may rescue from physical and mental bondage his colored brethren. And while your grateful spirits are pouring on his head unmeasured benedictions, will you not remember the mild precept of the Saviour: 'If ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.'Philadelphia.

       Our correspondent certainly exhibits no little ingenuity in twisting more than three-fourths of the names of those who signed the Anti-Slavery Declaration into his communication, so as to make them subservient to his pleasantry and to the common usage of language.            MR. EDITOR Since the National Convention was held in Philadelphia, the anti-slavery cause has certainly presented a Green and flourishing aspect. Abolitionism has digged a grave, and prepared a Coffin, for its dying antagonist, the American Colonization Society, which is soon to go to that Bourne from whence it can never return to disgrace our land, and persecute the poor and needy. No one pretends to deny that it has Wright on its side: it cannot, therefore, be overthrown. Besides, it is defended by a Garrison, which has successfully withstood the desperate assaults of its numerous foes, and the fires of which are so galling as to strike terror throughout the dominions of tyranny. It has also a war Ship-ley-ing in the port of Philadelphia, which, though commanded by a Quaker, is not surpassed by Old Ironsides. Should it hereafter be wounded, a first-rate surgeon, who is neither a Quack nor a Coxcomb, stands ready to use the lance and the probe, and will accept of no recompense. True, complete victory it may Win-slow, but it is sure. It does nothing in a s-Kimball-skamble manner. It first got an inch then it took a Good-ell and now it occupies a large portion of American territory. Having traversed New-England, and nearly all the free States, it is now grandly marching to the Snuthard, and will soon pass over the Alleghany mountains; and should it be encountered by all the men-stealers en masse, it will triumphantly re-Buffum. O'tis a cheering spectacle! enough even to make the poor bondman leap in his chains, and invoke a Ben'son (benizon) upon its head! It has a large White banner, upon which is inscribed in starry letters, the glorious Mott-o 'IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION!' Enlisted in its mighty phalanx is a Lewis, worth all that have ever sat, or probably ever will sit, upon the throne of France. It is thus that Kings-ley down, and do homage to moral excellence. There is another estimable soldier, whom we are proud to Rank-in it and a third of Sterling worth. A fourth is an eloquent and zealous Denison, ['denizen, a freeman,'] who is now lifting up his voice like a trumpet, in behalf of those who are in bonds. The fifth differs from him, inasmuch as he is a Still-man; but if he talks little, he labors much. The sixth is revealing the Murray ('murrey darkly red,') stains of slavery to the people of Vermont, and enlisting their sympathies for the bleeding slaves. The seventh holds a su-Purvis-ion over the whole ground of controversy. One is a Sleeper, but he never slumbers when on duty, and is always wide awake whenever his services are needed. He is associated with one who keeps a Sharp look-out, and is of tried integrity. One modestly offers to serve as a Prentice, but he needs no instruction. There is another who is generally al-Loughhead (allowed) to be true as the needle to the pole. We have others of as genuine worth as the Vickers of Wakefield. The wares of our Potter are the right kind to be used in the present campaign, and far superior to those manufactured in China. We have one Fussell (fossil) that is invaluable in our cabinet. Some declare that our cause, once so far At-lee-ward, would never have got ahead so fast, had it not been for our Jocelyn (jostling.) True, and we are resolved to jostle aside all who stand in the way of justice and humanity. Others assert that none but Yankees are engaged in it. This is a mistake. There's one South-mayd, at least, and he is a host in himself. Another hails from Barbadoes, although he is a loyal citizen of Boston. Colonizationists falsely maintain that he was born in Africa. The Adelphi Hall all will remember with affection and delight, as peculiarly captivating and admirably furnished. Should our cause grow lethargic, it will be sure to get such a Tappan (tapping) as will restore it to its primitive vigilance and activity. The slaveholders, who behave at the South-wick-edly, may successfully strain at a Virginia Nat, (Nat Turner,) but they will be choked if they try to swallow a Yankee Cambell. The sooner the monster SLAVERY is sent to Davy Jones' locker, the better: if he then thirst for human blood, he may Thurst-on.In conclusion, Mr. Editor, I would express a hope that no untimely Frost will nip the beautiful BUD OF LIBERTY, which we all know is seen to perfection in generous, charming, lovely May! I have ventured to be somewhat playful with some of the names which are appended to that important instrument, the DECLARATION put forth to the world by the National Anti-Slavery Convention; but I doubt whether I could succeed in correctly incorporating them all into this essay, even though I should try till next Whitson-tide.

       MR. EDITOR Having seen that term used of late, I was at first unable to affix any very definite meaning to it. I find, however, by examination, that it means, 'A christian editor, who is out of favor with the devil.'One who is neither a Priest nor Levite.One who has moral courage enough to do a cause more good than hurt.One who occupies precisely the ground which certain ones now secretly approve, and intend to occupy themselves as fast as it can be done without self-denial.One who suffers persecution, for righteousness' sake, and risks life and liberty in a good cause.One whose course has the approbation of his own conscience and the word of God, and consequently renders him 'exceptionable.'One who is liable to be treated with ingratitude by less efficient coadjutors.  very     One who has moral courage enough to do a cause more good than hurt   self-denial     exceptionable   ingratitude    PLYMOUTH.     

       The readers of the Liberator are probably disgusted in seeing the name of this individual so often obtruded upon their notice; but it is at least as offensive to me as to them, and I refer to it with a repugnance which necessity and duty can scarcely overcome. It is his appendency to the Colonization Society which alone raises the ex-agent to public notice; and it is for the purpose of showing them both in their true character, and thus humbling them in the dust, that I make such frequent references to them. My feelings towards Mr. Cresson are by no means personally unkind; but I have not been able to discover any thing liberal, manly, or upright, in his character, as the representative of the vilest combination which has ever cursed mankind. I detest his principles and his actions, because of their corruption and baseness; and, until he repent and forsake them, I can never vouchsafe to him my respect or confidence.It is to the kindness of GEORGE THOMPSON, Esq. that I am indebted for the following copy of a letter which was transmitted to a venerable and much esteemed Friend, by Mr. Cresson, on his departure from England to the United States. Its vituperative attacks upon me its numerous falsifications but, above all, its grave and positive assertions respecting the language used by THOMAS CLARKSON, in reference to my labors in a cause which is so precious to his soul all fully authorized Mr. Cruickshank to permit copies of it being taken, and sent to Clarkson and myself. If all the letters which Mr. Cresson has written, in relation to his mission and my own, could be given to the public, they would exhibit such a portraiture of their author, as would augment the disgust and exalt the astonishment of those who now regard him with distrust and contempt.Before this letter was written, I had an interview with Mr. Cruickshank in London, and was received by him very kindly. He had antecedently discovered the true character of the American Colonization Society, and was not a little chagrined to find that money had been obtained from him, by false representations, in aid of its wicked designs. Mr. Cresson's apologetical epistle is by no means calculated to moderate his indignation.         (COPY.)NO.19, Adam Street,Adelphi, 9 mo.9, 1833.      ALEXANDER CRUICKSHANK:Dear Friend It was with much regret that I learned the change wrought in your opinions by the artful misrepresentations of C. Stuart, and which have prevented my addressing you earlier, because I thought that until you had seen, in some degree, the fallacy of those positions assumed by that party, any statements from me would be unavailing. I am now grateful to find that the happy termination of the W.I. question, leaving no room for the display of further jealousy,* many of the more honest of our former adversaries are displaying a change of opinion, alike honorable to themselves, and favorable to the future hopes of Africa. Even Josiah** himself has shewn a very great alteration in sentiment, since the reception of letters from leading Friends in America, and giving strong proofs of their confidence and attachment to the Society. Our old and beloved friend Beulah Sansom, from whom I have received several letters since leaving Edinburgh, says, that if any of her old friends in England do not love both the Colony and Society, tell them from her, it is only because they have not had the opportunity of knowing the value of both.*** Thomas P. Cope, President of the Pennsylvania Society, is a leading Friend, and succeeds our beloved Dr. James, whose health required his release from the service. If, however, any doubts rest upon your minds, please judge of Garrison from his attack in the Patriot of 21st ult. and have the kindness to peruse carefully the exposure of his falsehoods by 'BETA,' now enclosed. Had the columns of a newspaper admitted more space, similar baseness in misrepresentation, &c.&c. might have been added, ad infinitum. He did not venture to print his last until safely on shipboard and out of reach(!!!)(4*) His visit to the venerable Clarkson only appears to have strengthened the dear old man's faith in the PURITY AND EXCELLENCE OF OUR SYSTEM. I have seen him since, and he feels how justly the mad career of such a man is to be DREADED(5*) by the real friends of emancipation, and as eminently calculated to defeat the hopes of the negro's judicious advocates. If you have read W. Innes' excellent little book, the charges of 'Coercion,' &c. so diametrically opposed to both the letter and spirit of the Society's constitution and acts,(6*) must be seen through; and we might add that there are now fifty fold more applicants than means of colonizing them. We have sent out directions to our Governor to plant an Edina, and although the proposed £800 appears to have stopped at £116,(7*) we trust that the namesake will not be the less worthy of her parent's name. And thou may rest assured that thy £5 have defrayed 2-3 the expense of a willing and grateful emigrant.(8*) The letters of those who have gone all speak the language of gratitude for the benefit conferred; and as 247 slaves were emancipated for the express purpose within the past year, it is to be regretted that our worthy friend Padmore(9*) has had statements so much at variance with truth made to him. I regret this the more, as the subscription he made being the only one in Britain from a person of color, it stood out in beautiful relief in an effort for the sole benefit of that race.(10*) Since the new year, a much larger proportion of slaves have been sent in two cases where 100 were sent, in each it happened that 96 were emancipated slaves, and of course were then 'free men,' but not in the sense artfully conveyed to John Padmore. The students of the Andover Theological School have determined to supply the means to send 100 slaves this year from Kentucky the number offered in that state only, being very great. If, therefore, each of the great names in your committee had subscribed only very moderately, we might have added many more to the enfranchised citizens of Edina, and made it a still more worthy memorial of Scot's benevolence. Most of them did nothing.But leaving theory out of the question our practice, last year, was that of giving a home, a country, a freehold,(11*) and every means of future independence, to 800 individuals 3 schools and as many meeting houses were built commerce, agriculture,(!) and the mechanic arts vastly extended, and one new colony on the St. John's river commenced, and is in a most flourishing condition, with about 200 colonists, having been the happy means of terminating already the slave-trade formerly carried on by the natives. Our Society of female Friends in Philadelphia has 3 schools in active operation, and hope to be able ere long to double the number. I therefore indulge the hope that Africa may soon be what I always wished the bond of union and joint labor between England and the United States. We owe her much, and if cordially united in schemes for her benefit, must learn to love each other.Being on the wing for America, (as I sail on the 8th of 10th mo.) I shall be much gratified to hear from you on my arrival in Philadelphia, where I cannot but gratefully and affectionately remember the many kind attentions of thyself thy wife and family to whom please tender my grateful regards.Thine truly,(Signed)    Dear Friend artful misrepresentations fallacy of those positions assumed by that party no room for the display of further jealousy Even Josiah himself has shewn a very great alteration in sentiment Friend please judge of Garrison from his attack in the Patriot falsehoods similar baseness in misrepresentation, &c.&c. might have been added, ad infinitum.

I place no confidence in this statement.*** An old lady in Philadelphia, (who, probably is as ignorant of the principles and tendencies of the Colonization Society as she is of the Chinese language,) says that the Society and colony are highly meritorious. This must have been a poser to the venerable Cruickshank! Only imagine, for a moment, the position assumed by the courageous Mr. Cresson! He gets behind this old lady for security, then somewhat unceremoniously pushes her into the field of controversy, and cries out to the enemy, 'Surrender to us! Here is one broad enough to cover the Society and colony, and heavy enough to weigh down all that dare oppose her!'(4*) Bravo! This from a trembling, paltering, vanquished craven! and written, too, after he had skulked from a fair and honorable discussion of the merits of a Society which he was in duty bound to vindicate! Can any thing be more ludicrous than the charge which he thus privately brings against me! He did not venture to print his last, (how did be venture to print his first?) until safely on shipboard and out of reach'! And all through fear of Mr. Elliott Cresson! of him whom I had vainly endeavored, for the space of three months, by every means in my power, to bring to a public conflict! This is alike comical and coxcomical.Now, what is the ground upon which he has built his victorious accusation? It is briefly this: I had purposed leaving England two or three weeks earlier than I was enabled to leave. My intention was known, unquestionably, to Mr. Cresson. As soon as he supposed I was 'safely on ship-board and out of reach,' he then ventured to answer, in the London Patriot, some interrogations which I had propounded to him in the Times. Fortunately, I was detained long enough to expose the duplicity and foolishness of his reply. It is true, on my passage from London to Portsmouth, I finished my review, and sent it by the post to the editor of the Patriot, but it was not inserted, in consequence of its extreme length, arising from the mass of evidence which it was necessary for me to adduce. My first rejoinder was published before I left London.(5*) This, I am sure, is a most heinous misrepresentation. My interview with Mr. Clarkson was full of affection, tenderness and solemnity. A copy of this letter has been transmitted to him by some of my friends in London, and whatever reply he makes to it shall be faithfully published on its receipt.(6*) 'And acts'! Compare this statement with the Rev. Mr. Breckinridge's confession, at the late meeting of the Society in Washington.(7*) Alas, for Edina! The humbug has only served to cover Mr. Cresson with ridicule and disgrace, and, among other inducements, to colonize him, 'with his own consent,' in this country! I do not believe that £20 have been received from Edinburgh for the creation of this fanciful settlement.(8*) A thumper! Deduct from this sum a just proportion which is necessary to defray the expenses of the Society and colony, and there will be scarcely five shillings left.(9*) This individual is a very respectable colored man, whom Mr. Cresson succeeded, for a time, in duping, but who now heartily execrates both the deceiver and the Society which he represented.(10*) How exceedingly pathetic! 'For the sole benefit of that race'! how full of verity!(11*) Here, too, the horrible developments at Washington, respecting the condition of the colonists, form a strong contrast to this deceitful statement. The home, and country, and freehold, which these poor exiles have found, have been banishment, starvation, and the grave.     behind us!   privately his last his first? safely on shipboard and out of reach ! fear         him         home country freehold banishment, starvation grave    

       A highly respectable clergyman from one of the slave States, some years since, visited New-England, when the evil of slavery was little considered, and when good men and pious ministers thought it was right to hold slaves. This clergyman called upon a distinguished minister in New-England, and proposed to discuss with him the merits of the slave question, expecting to convince him of the lawfulness of slavery. The minister, at the commencement of the debate, remarked, that we were required to love others as ourselves, and said to him, 'Should you be willing to be a slave?' To which he replied, 'O, I never thought of that,' and immediately gave up the debate. Are there not many christians, and christian ministers at the south, who hold slaves, and many at the north who excuse the evil, and talk much about the comforts of the slaves, who 'never thought of that,' or inquired whether they should be willing to be slaves themselves, or whether they are doing to others as they would have others do to them?  right O, I never thought of that christian ministers north excuse the evil   

       Our much esteemed, courageous and talented co-adjutor, the Rev. Mr. SOUTHMAYD, has resigned the editorship of the Observer. We regret his loss from a station which he has filled with so much credit to himself, and greatly to the advancement of the cause of truth and righteousness. His place is filled, however, by one whose long experience, solid worth, and discriminating mind, give satisfactory assurance that the Observer will continue to be worthy of the deference and patronage of an enlightened and liberal public we mean the Rev. ASA RAND.The following is a portion of Mr. Southmayd's valediction:I have of late occupied a large portion of the columns of the Observer with the all-engrossing subject of Anti-Slavery, because I have felt certain that unless its principles are adopted very generally, we are a ruined nation. Some have thought that too much has been said and written respecting it, and that it has been an injury to the paper. On the review, however, of my course, I know not where I should be willing to have a sentence struck out. I have expressed my sentiments in opposition to the time-serving policy of the age, strongly. I have censured the slaveholder, and have held him responsible to God and this nation as a man involved in the deepest guilt, of which he refuses to repent. I would not alter what I have written. Let it stand us a memento of my feelings to be read by other generations when the horrid system of slaveholding will be regarded, as it is, most foul and bloody.If my efforts to awaken the church to activity and zeal in relation to the great objects of Christian benevolence, have in any measure been successful, I owe it to him whose blessing will give efficiency to the feeblest exertions made with reference to his glory. It is my earnest prayer that those who have been accustomed to read this paper since I have conducted it, may be found at last, with all those who in every place love our Lord Jesus, on the right hand of God who is the fountain of eternal life. With these expressions of my regard for those for whom I have labored during almost 15 months, and of my regret on leaving them, I subscribe myself their fellow-servant in the vineyard of Christ,            DANIEL S. SOUTHMAYD.     

       MR. EDITOR, In reflecting upon the evil of slavery, I have been led to regard, with some attention, more especially that of a moral character. One circumstance, which gave occasion to this train of thought, was the manner in which this subject is regarded by a great proportion of the evangelical ministers, within the circle of my own acquaintance. The region in which I reside is probably as well supplied, numerically, with those of the Congregational, Baptist and Methodist denominations, as almost any part of New-England. One of the fundamental doctrines preached and insisted on by all these, is, immediate repentance of sin, in whatever form or under whatever circumstances it may exist.Yet among the whole number within a considerable distance, I know of but few who are not, more or less, opposed to the Anti-Slavery cause. Comparing this course with the tenor of their preaching, I am unable to reconcile it, and think the subject calls loudly upon them for explanation. A few months since, there was not a solitary watchman on the walls of Zion, in this region, who openly espoused and fearlessly advocated this glorious cause. More recently, a few have been led to a candid examination of the heterodox and fanatical notions of abolitionists, the result of which, it is unnecessary to add, has constrained them to say, that whereas they were once blind, now they see! But what is, if possible, still more surprising, is, that some of this class are not a little inclined to irritability! a circumstance quite unaccountable! They will indeed uniformly tell you that they are abolitionists, (abstract?) and in proof will forthwith call your attention to the christianization of Africa, by means of a colony of free colored people at Liberia! (and this evidence you may as well take first as last, for it is all they will give you) for should you happen to suggest the idea of sending duly qualified missionaries to Africa, as being more appropriate to the work, and propose efforts sanctioned by law and religion for the liberation, instruction and christianization of the Afric-Americans in this their native land, inasmuch as the money necessary to be expended in the transportation of two or three millions of our countrymen to that part of the earth, would be somewhat more advantageous to the cause of christian benevolence, if appropriated for the support of literary and religious institutions among them in this country in short, should you advocate the 'incendiary' doctrine of obligation to treat them as brethren, and to do unto them as in like circumstances we should wish to be done unto and go a step further, and question the moral rectitude of making shade of complexion a shibboleth of expatriation, seeing God hath made of one blood all nations and you discover, at once, strong marks of irritability; and that, too, when perhaps having come directly from the pulpit, where they have given an excellent discourse from the following texts: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' 'For, I perceive of a truth, that God is no respecter of persons' or other like passages. Surely it would seem that these things ought not so to be.I would by no means bring a railing accusation against a class of men, whom I sincerely love, respect and revere; yet I do call on them, as men subject to like passions with others, to lay aside that prejudice which prevents a candid examination of this all-important subject. This cause is the cause of God, and there is quite enough prejudice and opposition in the minds of certain other classes, and more especially as this course tends much to keep back many of their bearers, and they thus not only 'take away the key of knowledge, and refuse to enter in themselves, but hinder those who are entering in.' Will not the blood of slavery be found in the skirts of even ministers, who are not immediate holders? It is almost unnecessary to remark, that their present ground is untenable, and that they must sooner or later abandon it. Let such as are waiting for a more convenient season be kindly and respectfully admonished that that season is now.  immediate   candid tell you free duly qualified more appropriate native    candid other classes enter that season is now.    W. .   I think, Mr. Editor, you have received your fall quota of a commodity, which comes as near abuse as it can and miss, seen from this class, and if this article is too much like a 'firebrand,' I think you had better not admit it as people discriminate strangely now-a-days; for, if it was a little more correct and scriptural, it might be mistaken for 'Garisonism.'  abuse miss  discriminate

       MR. EDITOR Before I began to read the Liberator, I knew but little or nothing about you or your paper. I had barely heard (I think at the time of the Southampton insurrection) that there was a man in Beston who was exerting his influence to spread discord and discontent among the negro race. As to the Colonization Society, I knew but little what it was doing, though I always supposed its objects, its influence and operations to be good; for I knew great men, and I believed good men, were engaged in its cause; and when its agents came along, holding up suffering Africa's wants, I cast in my mite towards its support. But when the Society held a meeting in the first church on the subject, last 4th of July, two of the Liberaters were carelessly dropped into the contribution box, instead of bank notes. I did not hear Mr. Buffirm's address when he was in this town; but I understood he was met on even ground by some of the most able men of the town, his arguments refuted, and he hissed out of the house by his hearers(!) Being met by such men of worth and intelligence, and yielding the field. (as I was told he did,) I concluded at once that he was either misguided and deluded, or a bad man engaged in a bad cause. By reading your paper, I have myself become a firm abolitionist. But if the cause of the colonizationist is bad as you fairly prove it to be, I cannot see why our northern men engage in it, unless they are deceived, which I know cannot be the case with them all.I am confident that ignorance is the greatest block that lies before the wheels of your car; but light and truth are beaming forth, and your cause is making a rapid advance, and will continue to advance so long as laws are passed to prohibit instruction to any of our race, and a durable coat of tar offered its supporters. Sir, there is but just opposition enough to make it go well; but go it does, and go it will, until the captive goes free although I fear it will convulse our national union.My heart has often been made to bleed tosee so much abuse cast upon the black man and woman, as they pass the streets, merely because their skin is darker than their persecutor's; and their education entirely neglected, because none would instruct them, or because none would associate with them. I rejoice now that their cause is so ably maintained. I have, of late, with the aid of your paper, advocated freely the cause of the degraded African; but I am generally defeated. I am told he is capable of being nothing but a slave. I have been told by one who reads much, and is well acquainted with history, that the negro race can be traced down through the Ourang Outang to the monkey race, and he can make many believe it. I am told that if the slaves are set free without colonization, they will come up like the locusts of Egypt to pilfer and plunder and undermine the honest laborer.Yours, &c.         so     ----- -----.     

 The Hon. WILLIAM WIRT died at Washington on Tuesday, Feb'y 18th, aged 62 years.At a meeting of the bar of the Supreme Court, Mr. WEBSTER announced the death of Mr. WIRT. The customary resolutions were passed, and Mr. SOUTHARD was appointed to deliver a discourse to the bar on the character of Mr. WIRT.Mr. SWAN, Mr. JONES, Mr. WEBSTER, Mr. CLAY, Mr. SOUTHARD, Mr. SERGEANT and Mr. PETERS, were appointed a committee to address the family, and to request that Mr. Wirt may be buried in Washington, and that his professional brethren be permitted to raise a monument to his memory.         

       MR. EDITOR, I noticed a trifling colonization item of expense, to which Agents in their public addresses are not always careful to advert, somewhat incidental, but still would probably amount to a few dollars in the aggregate.In a letter of Gov. Mechlin to Mr. Gurley, dated January 25, 1832, published in the African Repository, he says: 'We can receive a thousand emigrants this year, provided the lumber, shingles and nails are sent out by the two first expeditions.' It appears, then, that it is 'expedient' to colonize their dwelling houses, (as another writer mentions that it will not do to expose them to the night air!) Much has been said by the friends of that scheme about its preliminary operations. It would seem that they have had some occasion for so doing, and ever will have.

 The Captain of a vessel at Kingston, Jamaica' writes to his owners under date of January 1st, complaining of the delays to which he had been subjected, on account of the holidays, and adds, 'the blacks have as much to say about it as any body.

What the erudite editor of that print means by it; what it is that 'the blacks have as much to say about as any body;' and what there is that they should not say as much about as any body, being free citizens; and further, why holidays should delay the Captain any the more because a black judge administers justice, is more than I can divine.Will you be so kind as to inform me, if in your power? and also why it is that every editor who professes himself a friend of that bankrupt society, which pretends to have the welfare of the colored population for its object, should endeavor by all possible means in his power to debase and degrade them in the eyes of the people, which is the only light in which I view the paragraph above?

A Brief Sketch of the Trial of William Lloyd Garrison, for an alleged Libel on Francis Todd of Newburyport, Mass   A Selection of Anti-Slavery Hymns, for the Use of the Friends of Emancipation      THE rapid multiplication of Anti-Slavery Societies, in various portions of our land, and the frequency of their public convocations, seem to require a judicious selection of Hymns, descriptive of the wrongs and sufferings of our slave population, and calculated to impress upon the minds of those who read them, or commit them to memory, or hear them sung, a deep sense of their obligations to assist in undoing every burden, breaking every yoke, and setting every captive free. Hitherto, in all meetings for the delivery of anti-slavery addresses, much embarrassment has been felt, in consequence of the difficulty of finding in the Hymn Books which are in common use, appropriate pieces to be sung on those occasions: hence, an earnest desire has been widely expressed that the detect might be remedied by a collection of anti-slavery hymns. I have therefore ventured to make the following collection, as an experiment which, if it succeed, may lead to something better and more voluminous. My materials have been so scanty as to prevent the exercise of that taste, and that classification and variety which are desirable. Some of the pieces are too long, but I have not felt authorised to mutilate them, as a few verses may easily be selected and sung; others are intended specially for the use of our colored brethren; others, perhaps, are not adapted to music, but may be read profitably. I have acknowledged the names of their authors, as far as I have been able to ascertain their origin. As the last Monday evening of every month is now extensively observed as a CONCERT OF PRAYER for the emancipation of the slaves, and the redemption of our land, this little book, it is believed, will be found useful on every such occasion. May the God of the oppressed bless it to the advancement of the cause of humanity and righteousness!     WM. LLOYD GARRISON.   Boston, March 1, 1834.    

              The purpose of the Lowell Anti-Slavery Society is to put forth what efforts we are able, in connection with other friends of humanity, to induce the emancipation of every Slave in our beloved country. This purpose obviously cannot be accomplished without the eventual co-operation of a large portion of our whole community; and we are well aware that the number of its decided advocates is at present small. In these circumstances, it is our incumbent duty, and our true policy, to publish at the outset a brief exposition of the principles we adopt and the measures we intend to pursue. We have not a project or a thought that we could wish to conceal; therefore we cheerfully invite our fellow citizens to examine our principles and watch our proceedings.We avow our settled belief, that every human being born into the world, has an equal right with every other human being, to life, liberty, and opportunity for the pursuit of happiness. While he respects the rights of others, this right is inalienable under all the circumstances of his being. It is regulated, for his and the general good, during his minority; it is modified and restricted by the necessary obligations of the social and civil compact; it is forfeited, only by crime against society. God has subjected the earth and the beasts of the field to the dominion of man; but has not given man a lordship over his fellows, to abridge their freedom, to hold them as property, or to enjoy their unrequited services. Therefore, the act of capturing and enslaving freemen is a direct and palpable usurpation of power; whether a Caesar subjugates a nation, or a kidnapper sacks a peaceful village. The latter is a sin against God, against personal rights, against the peace of society, against common humanity. That which is originally oppression, can never become right by the lapse of ages, by hereditary descent, by constitutional provisions, or legal enactments. It cannot be justified by pleading the necessities of a hot climate, a sable color, inferior intellectual endowments, or kind treatment.Under its most mitigated forms, slavery is a cruel curse to the enslaved; while it is indefensible oppression on the part of 'the owner,' and of the government under whose shadow he rivets the chains. Too long, enveloped in the gross darkness of established customs, have we overlooked the principles of eternal equity. Could we place ourselves at once under the light of that day, when righteousness and liberty and peace shall fill the earth, the holding of slaves would appear as one of the most preposterous and incredible of all the hoary-headed abominations which enlightened and Christian people have practised without compunction.This practice is far more criminal in a free country, under a republican government, than it can be in any other portion of the globe. This nation stands before the world in the most humiliating attitude of a people, enjoying the highest freedom themselves, and yet holding two millions of immortal beings as property, and treating them as beasts of burden.Such an evil committed by such a people, cannot fail to be displeasing to the Ruler of nations; and with Jefferson we tremble for our country when we reflect that God is just. We believe that national repentance alone c[ ]n avert national calamities for this sin, and save us from ruin. Whether it will be the divine purpose to permit the enslaved to acquire their liberty by insurrection; or to escape from bondage while the States shall rush to mutual conflict; or to secure the safety of all classes by voluntary liberation, we have not the wisdom to foresee. In the hope that the blessing of God on remonstrances and benevolent efforts, will effect a peaceful and happy release from the heavy curse, we engage in the present enterprise.Our general course of action is plainly indicated by the nature of the evil and the relations of all the interested parties. We have neither the power nor the right, even were half the union with us, to redress the wrongs of the colored people by physical force. We are under a solemn pledge to respect the federal constitution, under which we live in common with the planters and legislatures of the South. Were the whole country and the general government thoroughly in our views, national legislation could directly touch the evil only in the District and Territories where the jurisdiction belongs exclusively to the U. States. If the constitutions should ever be altered, and the relation of the States to the Union ever be changed, it cannot be done till the voice of the people demands it. We are therefore confined, most willingly, to the use of moral influence; and we distinctly avow, that our single aim is not to make war upon the system of colonizing the free people of color, but to diffuse light upon the subject of slavery; to spread facts and principles before the community; to rely upon the interests and moral integrity of men for the voluntary abandonment of this iniquity; and to expect the final action for the liberation of the slaves from the individuals who hold them, from the State legislatures, and from the national congress.The hereditary possession of slaves and of their time and services being founded in unrighteousness, they have in the court of conscience a claim for instant freedom; and either their nominal owners, or the community which upholds them in the deed, are solemnly bound to retrieve, as far as possible, the injuries they have inflicted. They must not be thrown upon the unfeeling world unprotected, unprovided for, disqualified for maintaining and governing themselves, and fitted only to ruin themselves by preying upon others. A long account with them is in the arrears; and they should not be driven out empty and friendless from the house of bondage. Especially does it become us to fortify and prepare them by the influences of knowledge, morality and religion; those influences which we have so wickedly withheld from them, and so misrepresented in our treatment of them.But it may be inquired, What has New-England to do with this southern business? What can a few small societies in the North effect, against the interests, the prejudices, and the chartered rights of the southern States? Our reply is, that the south and north are one country, and their inhabitants one people. We have a constitutional right to express our opinions and exert a moral influence; for we are constitutionally connected with the slaves and their masters. A slave representation, united with ours, legislates for the Union; and on slavery itself in the Territories and the District of Columbia. We are virtually taxed for the support of the unhallowed system. Our people are directly involved in the guilt of introducing and sustaining it. A general insurrection at the South could be suppressed only by the aid of northern treasure and northern blood. It is at present a national sin; of which every citizen must bear a just proportion, unless he washes his hands of the evil, or unless all will repent and reform together. By every social compact, an obligation involves a corresponding right. We have therefore an indisputable right, within constitutional limits, to lift up our voice; and while every impulse of religion and humanity requires it; while the groanings of millions daily cry to heaven against us; and while we see our southern brethren themselves approaching a fearful vortex, from which nothing but a speedy retreat can save them, we must not, we dare not, be silent.How far we shall unite our energies with other Anti-Slavery Societies; what other friends of the injured and oppressed, Providence may raise up to help us; what disappointments and trials of our faith may await us; and how long the desire of our heart may be deferred, we know not. Our duty is plainly before us, and we gird ourselves to the discharge of it; confident that the principles of humanity and justice have a hold in the hearts of this community which nothing can sunder; and trusting that the Beneficent Ruler will smile on the feeble efforts of those who seek the liberation of the oppressed, and the universal diffusion of liberty, knowledge and eternal life.The following is the list of officers:Rev.

          Esteemed Friend W.L. Garrison:I have been a reader of the Liberator for the last fourteen months, and have perused its pages with much interest; and in the last number which came to hand, issued January 4, I noticed an article headed 'THE PRODUCTS OF SLAVE LABOR,' signed C.F. which contains sentiments with which I do not unite. He says'It is often eloquently urged upon us that we should not so much as touch any thing suspected of contamination with the accursed system; and in abhorrence of the sin of slavery, there is danger lest we rashly adopt a course of conduct, calculated rather to retard than forward the cause so dear to us. Unless it can be shown that the practical bearing of the course of total abstinence proposed, is a mean of the abolition of slavery, I cannot think myself called to abstain. I have already given my reasons for not believing the use of slave products to be morally wrong, and having gone thus far the question of the probable results of abstinence upon the community is a difficulty which meets one at the threshold.'I shall endeavor to show the practical bearing that total abstinence, especially if it were universal abstinence, would have on the system of slavery. First, They depend, at the South, upon slave labor for existence, We of the north, east and west, make those labors profitable, by using the products of them. For instance: How would the editors of the Liberator support their paper, if every one would withdraw their patronage? Do not their patrons support them? Would not that, or any other paper, cease, if they had no other support but that of the editors and publishers? if no one would 'so much as touch' or look at them? Again, how or what would the retailers do, if there were no consumers? And what would the wholesale merchant do, if there were no retailers? And what would the planters do, if there were no merchants, retailers or consumers, to uphold them in their 'accursed system'? Would not the slaveholders have to abandon their man-stealing and robbing? and this, too, for better reasons, and in consequence of more pacific and christian conduct, than it would be to 'hold a knife at their throats.' Nor is it stronger or weaker than 'moral persuasion.'  Let C.F. answer it.Does C.F. think that it is immoral to steal, rob and murder, in order to procure articles to subsist on? And are we not sharers in the crime, if we receive and share in them, knowing them to be such? If I handle the plunder, and another holds the bag, and the third carries it to C's house, and all four use it; does C. act morally, or immorally, in partaking of it, seeing 'the receiver is as bad as the thief'? And perhaps the thief maintains his family by his pilfering and robbing! Yet, if I withdraw my support, it will 'directly tend to deprive them of bread, and increase the distress they already experience as a consequent of' stealing, &c. Would he think this good reasoning? Yet it is a fair comparison with the course C. appears to favor. I can see no essential difference between highway robbery, which the laws of our country do not justify, and robbing a man of his liberty and property, who is held guiltless by the laws of the slave States; the principle is the same; the only difference is in the degree if it will at all bear a comparison. The latter is a thousand fold more wicked and unjust; for what would a man take in exchange for his liberty? Now, if we do not perceive it expedient to cease from supporting a system which cannot be perpetuated but by violence and fraud, it must be because we are so habituated to it, and educated in the use of its products; and this habit and education so far become 'second nature' to us, that our moral senses have become blunted in the perception of its wrongs and enormities. 'Beside, why should we connect with anti-slavery principles so plain and defensible in themselves a measure of doubtful expediency, and one about which there is a division of opinion in the community? So far as this measure is not necessarily connected with our views as to the abolition of slavery, so far it is an injury rather than a benefit, because it connects an extraneous principle to one which should be brought before the American people, untrammaled and unprejudiced.' Now I think that abstinence is not a measure separate and distinct from anti-slavery principles, as C.F. supposes; but one with it, and belonging to it. He likewise says, it is 'a measure of doubtful expediency.' Now, if we who profess anti-slavery principles doubt the expediency of our not availing ourselves of the use of articles taken by violence, and fraud, and blood-shed, and handed down to us through several transfers, and for which we can show no better title than the master (so styled) can for his slaves so may he doubt the expediency of his sacrificing his claims. Now, to be consistent, we ought to cease even our 'moral persuasion' with the slave-holders, for their title is as good as ours; they did not steal the slaves first; they bought them, they will tell you, or, rather, the system 'was entailed upon them by their fathers.' Might not the slaveholders reason in the same way, with the same propriety that he has done? There is this difference; they are the first perpetrators we are their agents; and how can they continue in their system of robbery without our agency? Besides, is there any measure, about which there is no division of opinion? If not, then all measures are rendered abortive, seeing there are doubts and divisions concerning them all. Let C.F. not be deceived by the adversary of all good; for, remember, we are not to do evil that good may come, in partaking of their sins, lest we also partake of their plagues. If they perish, will not the guilt rest upon the heads of the oppressors?The editor favors the opinion that his correspondent 'is a total abstinence man in disguise.' If so, I think he does not regard the truth as a man should, professing such just and christian principles. I shall have to express a different opinion of him; I believe he is not an abstinence man, though personally unknown to me, for his 'weapons' do not favor those of a total abstinence man; but of a contrary principle. Therefore, let him seriously consider it, and answer for the benefit of himself 'and others.' Esteemed Friend W.L. Garrison:     probable   total universal touch look  'moral persuasion.'    principle use 'second nature' 'moral persuasion' 'was entailed   total abstinence total abstinence himself    ABSTINENCE.

       If we are not mistaken, no inconsiderable a portion of the Society of Friends in this country are disposed to favor the scheme of African Colonization, or at least are unfriendly to the proceedings of the Immediate Abolitionists. There seems to be manifested by the Society more indifference on the subject of slavery, than was to have been expected in view of the high ground which it formerly took in relation to the rights of the colored man.The editor of the Philadelphia Friend, though he seems to have some misgiving as to the final result of the Colonization scheme, and has introduced into his paper the celebrated. English Protest, declares, after expressing his belief that there are men of the purest intentions and of disinterested benevolence attached to both parties, that he has no disposition to enlist in the warfare. The editor is, in his own opinion perhaps, rather delicately situated, and of a disposition somewhat similar to an honest neighbor of ours, who, when a case was referred to him for decision, fearful of giving offence, declared he believed both parties were right. More recently, the editor has noticed the meetings of the Anti-Slavery and Colonization societies in the city of Philadelphia, and reiterated his belief that there are persons of the purest benevolence, ranged on either hand, who are equally intent on attaining, by different roads, the same great end. But does this belief prove that the Colonizationists will attain their great end? The editor has confessed, in the Friend, that it has ever appeared to him that the possible effects of the Colonization system in the extinction of slavery in this country were too remote and problematical to be relied upon.If he was thus convinced of the inefficacy of the Colonization Society for the abolition of slavery in this country, why has he remained a silent spectator of the fruitless pursuits of its members? reminding us occasionally that they are sincere in their pursuits: as if their sincerity in error were a sufficient reason for not attempting to arrest their progress. It was highly incumbent on him, if he saw the fallacy of the Colonization scheme, to express it, instead of continuing neutral, and suffering, as far as his influence extended, the wretched and despised Africans to linger in captivity. The Colonization Society is doubly reprehensible; for while 'it has no wish to interfere with the delicate but important subject of slavery,' it has insinuated that one of its objects is the destruction of the system, and thus diverted the public attention from the only means of effecting that object. If its insinuations were just, it would be, par consequence, an Anti-Slavery Society. Whenever a society is formed for the extinction of any evil, we naturally expect that its members are not contaminated with the evil which they wish to extinguish. If a company of tiplers were to unite for the suppression of intemperance, we should unhesitatingly declare their object to be preposterous: they might indeed tell us that they were inveterate enemies to intemperance; but that circumstances rendered it improper for them, at present, to reform. We shall examine whether the Colonization Society is established on any better grounds than the Society we have just supposed. In the first place, many of its advocates would produce the impression that one of its primary objects, as we have before stated, is the abolition of slavery in the United States. But by whom was the Society founded? By men who, trembling under the weight of their country's guilt, were determined that none but the feet of freemen should henceforth tread its soil? No: it was founded and is managed principally by slaveholders men who, instead of denouncing slavery as a sin of crimson dye, and entirely repugnant to every principle inculcated in the Gospel, have acknowledged its constitutional and legitimate existence; and in perfect accordance with this acknowledgement, 'are ready to pass censure upon Abolition Societies in America,' and deny the design of attempting emancipation either partial or general. After this exposition, it is not at all surprising that the first man which the Colonization Society elected to preside over its councils should have been a domestic Christian broker in the trade of blood; that its second should have been a slaveholder; and that he who now fills the august chair should be trampling on the Declaration, that 'all men are born free and equal.' Yet in despite of all these facts, the Society has been palmed upon a large portion of the American public as an Anti-Slavery Society!It might have been supposed that the Society of Friends would be the first to put the seal of disapprobation on such an association, to expose its hypocrisy, and caution the public against being entangled in its wiles; but, instead of this, many of its members have descended from their lofty station, and offered the hand of friendship to the oppressors of their species. How would they have been rebuked by their illustrious fellow-professors, Woolman and Benezet! Did they recognize the principles of the Colonization Society? No. Did they acknowledge, in soft whispers, that slavery was an evil of the darkest character; but declare, in louder tones, that it would not do to open the gates at once, and suffer the dark flood to pour upon the land? that the enfranchised slaves must be transported to the land of their fathers? that the blacks can never be elevated here, but must remain forever in a debased and a degraded state? No! They urged upon the Society of Friends the duty of immediate, unconditional emancipation; and, soaring above the prejudice entertained against the African, sought to remove the burdens that bowed him to the earth the burdens of ignorance and vice. If justice demanded of a Society then the immediate relinquishment of oppression, its calls are equally imperious now upon the nation.It is important, at this time, to inquire, what the real specific objects of the Colonization Society are? 'The object to which the attention of the Society (see its Constitution) is to be exclusively directed, is, to promote and execute a plan for colonizing, with their consent, the free people of color residing in our country, in Africa, or such other place as Congress shall deem most expedient.' 'To found (says the African Repository,) in Africa an empire of christians and republicans; to reconduct the blacks to their native land, without disturbing the order of society, the laws of property, or the rights of individuals.' To reconduct the blacks, born in America, to Africa, their native land! a form of expression, which, had it not been used by the Savens of the country, would have become proverbial as the saying of some blundering Hibernian.But why reconduct the blacks to their native land? 'To save us, sooner or later, from the dreadful events foreboded by Jefferson, or from the horrors of St. Domingo.' Here, indeed, is the termination of the windings of the dark labyrinth into which the Colonization Society has, for years, decoyed the nation: yes, of that labyrinth, at whose avenues were inscribed, 'The emancipation and civilization of Africa.'The fate of oppressors, in a neighboring island, was a dreadful warning to those of the South: they lived in a state of perpetual alarms: the raging of fires, the fiend-like yells, and the gory streams of St. Domingo, were constantly in their ears, and before their eyes. How were these dire calamities to be averted? Either by setting their captives free, or by colonizing the free blacks. Avarice forbade the adoption of the first course; the latter was, therefore, the alternative. But the co-operation of the free States was deemed necessary to the success of the enterprise. To have honestly told the people of those States the truth, would have aroused the indignation of many, and frustrated the design of securing their assistance. Policy, therefore, dictated that the garb of benevolence should be thrown around the objects of the Society: the snare was too well laid, for the unwary multitude was caught. Through the medium of the Society, the arm of the oppressor was to be broken; the rites of barbarism and superstition were to be forgotten in Africa; its monuments of idolatry were beheld crumbling to dust, and the banners of the Prince of Peace waving, in triumph, over the renovated countries. But how were the mighty deeds to be accomplished in the land of darkness? Not by sending thither those whose hearts had been touched with a coal from off the holy altar: but 'a class notoriously ignorant, degraded and miserable mentally diseased, broken spirited, acted upon by no motives to honorable exertion, and scarcely reached in their debasement by the heavenly light.' Such was the character of the missionaries who were 'to found in Africa an empire of christians and republicans!' It may be asked, why these were selected? We reply, simply on account of their vicious characters. But if they had thus become almost the vilest of the vile where Christianity sheds its beams, they were unfit to be sent to expire amid the glooms of Paganism. We will follow them to Africa, and there witness the commencement of their labors. The natives soon began to manifest signs of hostility, and the colonists exhibited the first fair fruits of Christianity by joining with them in deadly conflict. But we are told that some of the hostile chiefs have appeared at Monrovia, and signed a treaty of perpetual amity and peace with the colonists, and that the strongest evidence might indeed be adduced of the friendliness of the natives generally. Does all this palliate in the least degree the evil of maintaining an armed force in the colony? We trow not. It is idle to talk of treaties of perpetual amity and peace, signed under the mouth of the cannon, and when the sound of the preparations of war are constantly falling on the ear: the history of nations teaches us that they signify nothing more than a suspension of hostilities.Look in particular at the history of our own country; treaty after treaty has been settled, and at the same time, battle after battle fought with the aborigines, from the first settlement down almost to the present day. And what has been the cause of this? The worldly policy pursued by the whites the same kind of policy that the colonists at Liberia are now pursuing. It is singular while those of other denominations are making its military character a ground of objection to the Colony of Liberia, that the members of the peaceful Society of Friends can find nothing in that circumstance to deter them from giving it their support: nay, that a writer in the Friend should have wrought his fig-leaf covering to screen the colony from censure cast upon it on that account. It is vain for any to avoid the charge of inconsistency, to seek a subterfuge in the circumstance of contributing to the support of the military government under which they live. The Quakers have always justified their conduct in contributing such support on the ground that our Saviour paid tribute, and commanded to 'render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.' But this command relates only to the requisitions of government: the Quakers cannot, therefore, use it as an apology for voluntarily joining a society which seeks to accomplish its objects by the aid of military power. They must find some other apology, or suffer the charge of inconsistency to remain in full force against them. The Colonization Society, by furnishing the colony of Libera with the means of defence, has become guilty of violating one of the fundamental principles of the Gospel, and on whom shall the charge of this violation rest but on those who compose the Society viz. its members? But if those of them who belong to the Society of Friends are not guilty, then all the others are exonerated, and the Colonization Society has in its warlike movements done nothing repugnant to the principles of christianity.Lynn, 2d mo. 11th, 1834.    their possible   sincerity only   domestic Anti-Slavery   they immediate, unconditional emancipation then now   native land! Savens   native land?

Drunkards, adulterers, and even traitors can tell you that men of the same character as themselves are spoken of in the Bible. It is true that the Bible speaks of such men, their practices, and their destiny but does it justify drunkenness, and lewdness, and treason? It speaks of extortioners but does it justify extortion?Of all men in the world, American slaveholders ought to be the last to open the Book of Truth, the word of the Holy God, in justification of their diabolical conduct. But it is not so strange that they should undertake to justify themselves in this way, as that clergymen in New-England should condescend to read for them. These be blind leaders of the blind. They darken counsel by words without knowledge.Some weeks since, while in conversation with a clergyman whose praise is in the churches, finding him an apologist for slavery, I asked him: 'Can man hold property in man?' He resorted to Scripture. Astonished, I asked him: 'Does our Bible, letter or spirit of it, justify slavery?' He again took himself to reciting passages from the Old Testament.Now I take it upon me to deny that any such system of slavery as ours ever existed among the Jews. If such a thing as involuntary bondage existed among them, it was never perpetual.But what is most important in the case is overlooked. The divine direction, regulating the duty of the ancient Jews towards their servants, extended only to them. It was not a general precept, extending to all men. The Jews were, at a certain time, commanded to go forth and slay certain people, But would that command, to that people, at that time, under those circumstances, justify all men, at all times, under all circumstances, in taking the sword and slaying at the dictates of their own lust, avarice and ambition? Point us to where Jehovah has commanded the white to enslave and imbrute the colored population of the United States; then will we cease hostilities against slavery in the United States. Show us one general precept, between Genesis and Revelation, which justifies slavery in general; then will we no longer oppose slavery in general.The omniscient God, in his word which he has given us, has either sanctioned slavery, or he has not. If he has, we must not war against it, lest haply we be found even fighting against God. Slavery is either right or wrong; if wrong, do the oracles of God justify what is wrong? No they are out against slavery, letter and spirit of them, from beginning to end.What is American slavery? It is a system of monstrous injustice, of intolerable tyranny, of villanous robbery. What! does the word of God justify these? Outrageous blasphemy! American slavery nullifies the marriage institution tramples humanity in the dust dries up the milk of human kindness in the breast breaks the strongest cords of human affection and wrests from the hands of our brethren the Bible, about which we are now speaking. And does this Bible justify these things? What then does it not justify?          extended only to them   has, wrong wrong       O.S.M.   Orwell, (Vt.) Feb. 7, 1834.

       Some years since a southern slave absconded secretly from his master, and fled into the State of Vermont. He had not long enjoyed his freedom, when he was recognized and seized by his pretended owner, who chanced to be travelling in that section of the country. Agreeably to the law, the master was obligated to prove in a court of justice, that the slave was his rightful property, before he could take him back to his plantation. The slave was accordingly summoned to appear in court, while the master presented sufficient evidence, as he supposed, to prove his property. But the judge pronounced the evidence insufficient. The master was not to be baffled in so plain a case. He appeared in court a second time, and produced every item of testimony and proof, which his most strenuous efforts could collect, and abundantly sufficient, he imagined, to place the question beyond all dispute. When the whole had been presented, the judge again pronounced the evidence to be altogether insufficient. The master was enraged 'What evidence will you have? he vehemently exclaimed. 'A bill of sale from the Almighty,' was the deliberate reply.  A bill of sale from the Almighty,    F.

          WHITESTOWN, (N.Y.) Feb. 6, 1834.   Dear Brother in Christ Excuse me for writing these few thoughts to you. I was once a bitter enemy my to you, just as I was to the black man, a on account of prejudice. I then viewed things through a false medium.The late debate held in Utica, on the merits of the Colonization Society, between the Rev. Mr. Danforth, general agent of the Society, and Mr. Green, caused me to open my eyes upon truth; for I found though I might be a very moral young man, and though I was a member of the Presbyterian church, I say, when I opened my eyes upon the word of God, I found in unequivocal terms that 'he who hateth his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen,' notwithstanding all his professions to religion and the cause of the black man. The debate was the most spirited one ever witnessed. Mr. Green spoke for the negative two whole evenings, with such pathos, eloquence and impressiveness of truth, that the whole attention of the audience was completely absorbed. It was emphatically the 'congress' of Utica assembled to decide whether they would any longer cast the weight of their prejudice into the public scale, to rivet the chains of the oppressed slave still stronger; or standup like christians, and assert and plead the rights of two millions of native born Africo-American brethren. I trust soon the whole debate will be published. When done, I intend to present you with a copy.As the 'Abolitionists, intend to use moral means, and to elevate the black man in this country by pouring upon him the means of knowledge and science; would it not be accordant with our principles to build an institution for this purpose? I doubt not if but the plan should be proposed, that there are many waiting to give of their substance, and that liberally, too, for it. If you please, let it be situated on the banks of the Hudson a 'manual labor school' that any size or complexion of body may enjoy its privileges, provided they give testimonials of a christian moral character.Do I hear you say, it would be difficult to raise funds? Sir, I believe the time is fast approaching when it will be difficult to raise funds for those institutions who now deny the black man an entrance. But perhaps the proper teachers are wanting. I believe the stand that many of them have lately taken in the cause of truth does not warrant the idea, especially those at the Western Reserve College. But then, where are the young men? I know of scores who are anxiously waiting for a privilege.These public discussions on slavery may be viewed in the light of 'revivals,' As 'revivals' raise up a band of young men for the holy ministry, so these discussions will raise up a host of young men, who will assert and vindicate the injured rights of the black man in thunder tones of truth.One who begins to feel for the oppressions of the African.  Dear Brother in Christ   emphatically  prejudice     who now deny the black man an entrance.    thunder tones of truth.   One who begins to feel for the oppressions of the African.   

                 Winter's sudden exit sing! Raise a high triumphal archFor the pioneer of Spring, Every child will welcome March!Though't is not as April fair, Nor exuberant as May;Yet of this you are aware For them both it leads the way.Shame on him it doth displease! July's beat his two lips parch,And his ears December freeze, Who defames right honest March!Winter, furious that his reign Closes, vents his ugly spite;Leaves behind a pesterous train, His successor's name to blight.How could mortal optics greet Budding flower or tasselled larch,Nature's aspect, fair and sweet, But for the forerunner March?Higher mounts the golden sun Now the wintry air is balmHail the reign of Spring begun! Hail each new developed charm!Call it what you will, my friend; Ugly, peevish, fickle, starchIn a month 't will have an end Bear, then, patiently with March!In a month 't will soon consume; Yet, perchance, ere it is o'er,You and I may find a tomb Let us squander time no more!

     Sadsbury, Lan. Co., Pa. th of st Mo   ESTEEMED FRIEND On reading the 2d number, vol. 4th. of the Liberator, I observed several articles copied from other papers, in which is contained much abuse and ill treatment to thyself: that copied from the Saco (Me.) Democrat is a little curious. He advises that thee should be treated with contemptuous silence, and yet he publishes his malignant spite to the world. If he really thought that his advice was good, he should have given evidence of his sincerity by the expressive language of conduct; but this is another proof that they who are governed by hatred are inconsistent with themselves, advising people not to do a thing, and at the same time doing it themselves. My salutation to thee is, FEAR NOT. But take courage neither be dismayed. It has always been the lot of the righteous to suffer persecution; it is impossible that it should be any other way as long as there are wicked people in the world, for it is the nature of wickedness to hate goodness: it cannot [ ] otherwise. If it had it in its power, it would [ ] goodness from the earth. My friend, be of good cheer, and faint not; for goodness is stronger than wickedness, love than hatred, kindness than unkindness. But some say, we ought to approach the slave-holder with kindness; and so say I. Now, it is important for men that they really know what kindness is. It certainly is not to tell a man an untruth, even if it is to gain his friendship; for a friendship that can be got in no other way than by telling a false-hood, is not worth having. If we find a man in a right practice, we should tell him so (if we speak of it at all) plainly, without any flattery; and if in a wrong practice, we will expose its deformity naked to his view, if we feel a disposition of kindness towards him; for it is the only way we can be of any service to him. It would do the thief and robber no good to tell them they are honest men; nor would do the slaveholder any good to tell him he is not pursuing a course of wickedness. This false charity and false kindness, that cry 'Peace!' peace!' when there is no peace, have had a powerful tendency to increase and perpetuate wickedness in the world. This truckling disposition never did and never will do any good. It is highly important that they who wish well to their fellow men, and to themselves, should be plain men: indeed, they will be so. That one precept of Christ 'Do unto others as ye would they should do unto you,' if universally observed, would do away all moral evil; on the other hand, the wider the departure from it, the greater will be the amount of wickedness produced, both in an individual and national point of view. Now, who departs further from this rule, in an individual capacity, than the slaveholder? or what nation departs further from it than a nation of slaveholders? I cannot conceive of any.     Thy friend, LINDLEY COATES.     

               AIR Scots wha hae, Scots wha hae,      Lo, in southern skies afar,Mounted on Oppression's car,Rides a pale and sickly star God of slavery:Misery, with ghastly train,Dealing horror, wo and pain,Sweeps along his fell domain, Like the troubled sea.              Sons of Freedom, favored high,Oh! regard the suppliant eye!Will you pass the black man by, Nor extend relief?When the skies are bright and fair,When ye breathe the fragrant air,When the heart is free from care, Heed his tearful grief!              Scorch'd beneath the burning ray,Lash'd along his weary way,Toiling lonely, day by day, In his clanking chain!Scorn'd detested, ever beThose who boast of liberty,Yet in cruel slavery Deathless souls retain!              Dare they steal, oppress, defraud?Let them tremble JUST IS GOD!See! he lifts his dreadful rod! Clouds of vengeance burst!As in wrath from pole to pole,Lightnings flash and thunders roll,Horrors seize each guilty soul It shall die accurs'd!              When your hearts with fervor glow,Round the altar bending low,CHRISTIANS! crave a blessing now, On the injured slave.God of Justice, to whose throneRises oft the prisoner's groan,Send, oh! send deliverance down, And in mercy save!New-Hampshire.

     PAWTUCKET, Jan. 28, 1834.   MY. FRIEND The mania of fanaticism (truth) is making sad (glorious) work here. Wo betide us, that we have not a Common Council like Utica, or respectable citizens enough like New-York, to raise a mob to put a veto on the sayings and doings of the visionary fanatics! But to the everlasting disgrace (honor) of this place, abolitionists are suffered to runat large, without being threatened with assassination, or without being tarred and feathered. And moreover (tell it not in the streets of Lowell!) they are permitted to peaceably assemble, and form an Anti-Slavery Society, without molestation! Should you have thought this, Mr. Editor, of any part or parcel of free America, where, according to logical definitions, disquisitions and deductions of the wise men of Gotham, the emancipation of the citizens from slavery would certainly annihilate the liberties of the country!But so it is; and unless some speedy help can be sent in among us from abroad, to aid the friends of the rights of man (to whip niggers to death with impunity,) I see not but the people here will generally conclude that the moral character of men is not to be found in their shins or heels and a woful state of things will this be! Ah! Mr. Editor, are you willing that a nigger should marry your daughter? Well, you must come to that, whether you have a daughter or not, if the people become settled in the opinion that a man's moral character is not to be inferred from his shins or heels. Awful to think of! for if a man's shins are not the test of moral character, then, by parity of reasoning, it cannot be found in his lips, nor nose, nor skull, and then opens a wide door, which no man can shut that a man made in the image of God is not an ourang outang! Seriously, we have, I think, much reason to thank God and take courage. The pure principles of abolition have, for some time, been making progress here. Two years since, I knew of but two or three active, enlightened friends of the cause here. Two citizens in private life, Mr. Rufus Bliss and Mr. William Adams, labored indefatigably in spreading your Thoughts on Colonization and other publications, which were the means of incalculable good. I have done what I could. We have had lately come into the place a powerful auxiliary to the cause, in the Rev. John Blain, who is now settled over the First Baptist Church. He is a man of talents, much apparent moral integrity, and great influence. When the subject was first presented to him, he did not first feel of the popular pulse, nor indeed of that of his own people, to see what the effect would be there; but as duty appeared plain, he moved forward like a man with a soul of his own. Mr. Editor, I glorify the grace of God in such men. But I will only add, that we completed the organization of a Society on Monday, the 27th instant. A list of the officers I herewith annex.Affectionately yours,  respectable citizens mob  run at large of free   abroad niggers here shins or heels you nigger Thoughts on Colonization his own      RAY POTTER.

         Oh, injured people, 'in our brightest hourOf conscious worth, of pride, of conscious power,'At once we'll 'dare to act the Christian part,That well befits a woman's' feeling heart:With shame we'll plead thy cause, so good and great,For shame is ours that we begin so late.Though 'skins may differ,' thou dost justly claim'A sister's privilege in a sister's name.''We are thy sister, God has truly said,That of one blood the nations he has made;'Yet woman, in this favored Christian land,Has long unblushingly broke God's command;*But now the cruel 'wrongs which wring thy heart,Shall draw a throb of pity on our part'Though 'skins may differ,' thou dost justly claim'A sister's privilege in a sister's name.'Daughter of Eve! my sister and my friend,To thee the hand of friendship I extend.'T is true that 'we must wither in the earth,From whence the dark and fair have equal birth;'But while before a throne of grace I bend,My prayers for thee and thine shall oft ascend,That Freedom's sons may feel their guilt with shame,And grant the rights which they so proudly claim.                              AUGUSTA.     * Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.    

          Who is the honest man?He that doth still and strongly good pursue,To God, his neighbor and himself most true: Whom neither force nor fawning canUnpin or wrench from giving all their due. Whose honesty is notSo loose or easy that a ruffling windCan blow away, or, glittering, look it blind: Who rides his sure and easy trot,While the world now rides by, now lags behind. Who, when great trials come,Nor seeks, nor shuns them; but doth calmly stay,Till he the thing and the example weigh; All being brought into a sum,What place or person calls for, be doth pay. Whom none can work or wooTo use in any thing, a trick or sleight;For, above all things, he abhors deceit: His words and works and fashion tooAll of a piece, and all are clear and straight. Who never melts or thawsAt close temptations; when the day is done,His goodness sets not, but in dark can run: The sun to others writeth laws,And is their virtue; virtue is his sun. Who, when he is to treatWith sick folks, women, those whom passions sway,Allows for that, and keeps his constant way: Whom others' faults do not defeat;But though men fail him, yet his part doth play. Whom nothing can procure,When the wide world runs bias, from his willTo writhe his limbs, and share, not mend the ill. This is the Mark-man, safe and sure,Who still is right, and prays to be so still.                              their his                

              It need not be said, that a mind which could struggle to eminence through such an obstacle as corporeal infirmity, almost permanent and sometimes extreme, must be one of high order. For several months while Pres. Storrs was at Andover, he could devote but two hours a day to his books; but with this disadvantage, he displayed such a capacity for scientific acquisition, that one of his intimates at the seminary, Rev. Daniel Temple, observed of him, 'his mind is like a giant in a weak, shattered cage, and the giant cannot move without loosening all sides of the cage.' He was distinguished for steadiness, clearness, and purity of conception; power of thought, rather than quickness; the solid, acute and comprehensive, rather than the splendid and versatile; and a philosophical association of ideas, which was the more remarkable, as his literary course had been so often interrupted. First principles in all things, he seized with a capacious grasp; his opinions were his own, for he scorned to receive them from authority, he would defend them with regular, consecutive argument, and though they were not always true, he would always make them plausible. In conversation, he expressed his ideas with a chasteness, copiousness, and dignity of style, which are seldom surpassed; he disdained to trifle; and therefore exhibited an habitual steadiness, energy, and elevation of mind, which proved the rigid discipline to which he was subject.When speaking of the dead, however, we have most to do with the qualities of the heart, and when speaking of Pres. Storrs, we choose to have most to do with them; for in his heart lay his high distinctions. He not only had much of that diffidence which is constitutional, but still more of that modesty which is a virtue. He was too retiring. Had he been less so, we should have known more of his excellence. He rarely spoke about himself, even about his religious exercises, and therefore left his habits of thought to be inferred from his daily conduct. No one, save he that had eaten bread with him, could know him, and he that knew him best, esteemed him most. He often seemed to love to be undervalued by others, and he generally undervalued himself.Pres. Storrs was characterized by a singleness of aim. He had no prominent schemes of selfishness before his mind, and was therefore never an object of suspicion or distrust; his opposers, whatever cause they may have had for opposition, could not but feel that he was disinterested. He held it as his one paramount object, to accomplish the greatest amount of good, which was possible during his whole life. He laid a plan, for his was that species of mind which acted by plan, for the fulfilment of this great aim; he labored for it in the family, the study, the college, and the pulpit, with an even sober industry; all his other aims he subsidized to it by principle, as well as by system. The means of raising himself from the severest despondency which he ever experienced, was, the formation of the purpose, as a settled and definite one, to strive for the welfare of the world, whatever became of himself. He began to live more cheerfully, when he began to live more singly for others. He found his life in losing it, and forgot his own darkness in looking at the brightness of God.It is needless to say, that a man of our brother's rich endowments, must have been eminently qualified for the president's chair and the pulpit. Reserved and discreet in his ordinary intercourse, he never lost his dignity; he therefore secured the uniform obedience of his pupils, the respect, and often veneration of his parishioners. At the same time he was so equable, and gentle, and affectionate in his social feelings, that he bound the members of college to him with the cords of love, and while the members of his parish revered him as a guide, they trusted him as a father. His was a rare combination of sweetness of temper with firmness of authority; the amiable and commanding. He entered, with a livey interest into the circumstances of his scholars, accommodated his instructions to their diversified wants with aptness, and held in his mind a comprehensive and connected view of the distracting duties which were multiplied upon him. When he preached, and preaching was the employment which best harmonized with his temper, and from which he reluctantly descended to any, even the most honorable office, he never stood before his subject, and displayed his own powers; but always placed his subject before him, and while out of sight himself made the truth shine before his audience, and by cogent argumentation, and fervid feeling, and racy, elevated style, and distinct, dignified delivery, was often eloquent, and sometimes resistless. His high encomium is, that he was a sincere, lucid, faithful preacher of the truth as it is in Jesus.    too he that had eaten bread with him   to accomplish the greatest amount of good, which was possible during his whole life     

       The volume of Sermons by the late Rev. Joseph S. Buckminster, published at Boston in 1815, contains a discourse on the Epistle of Paul to Philemon, concerning which he makes the following remark:'There is a mixture of tenderness and of authority, of affection and politeness, in this short letter, an earnestness of intercession, united with a care not to offend, even by a word, a choice of phrases the least obnoxious, of arguments the most honorable, and of motives the most penetrating, which show the writer to have been a man of great address, as well as of strong affections, and master of a persuasion not easily resisted.'Afterwards he adds:'It happens, by a singular coincidence, that there has come down to us a letter of Pliny, the courtier, the consul, the man of letters, who lived in the same age with the apostle; a letter, addressed to one of his friends upon an occasion precisely similar to this of Paul, interceding for the pardon of a runaway slave. In comparison with that of Paul, however, I hesitate not to say, that it is altogether inferior, not merely in affection, in dignity and the spirit of christianity, of which Pliny was ignorant, but also in the subordinate beauties of style, and in the eloquence of persuasion. And yet Paul was a Jew of Tarsus, and Pliny, the ornament of an accomplished court and of a literary age.'The epistle of Pliny here referred to is the twenty-first in the ninth book. As some of our readers may be gratified by an opportunity of comparing this letter with that of Paul to Philemon, it is here extracted as given in W. Melmoth's translation.               Your freedman, whom you lately mentioned to me with displeasure, has been with me, and threw himself at my feet with as much submission as he could have fallen at yours. He earnestly requested me, with many tears, and even with all the eloquence of silent sorrow, to intercede for him; in short, he convinced me, by his whole behaviour, that he sincerely repents of his fault. I am persuaded he is thoroughly reformed, because he seems deeply sensible of his guilt. I know you are angry with him, and I know it is not without reason; but clemency can never exert itself more laudably than when there is the most cause for resentment. You once had an affection for this man, and I hope will have again; in the mean while, let me only prevail with you to pardon him. If he should incur your displeasure hereafter, you will have so much the stronger plea in excuse for your anger, as you shew yourself the more exorable to him now. Concede something to his youth, to his tears, and to your own natural mildness of temper; do not make him uneasy any longer, and I will add, too, do not make yourself so; for a man of your benevolence of heart cannot be angry without feeling great uneasiness. I am afraid, were I to join my entreaties with his, I should seem rather to compel, than to request you to forgive him. Yet I will not scruple even to unite mine with his; and in so much the stronger terms, as I have very sharply and severely reproved him, positively threatening never to interpose again in his behalf. But though it was proper to say this to him, in order to make him more fearful of offending, I do not say so to you. I may, perhaps, again have occasion to entreat you upon his account, and again obtain your forgiveness; supposing, I mean, his fault should be such as may become me to intercede, and you to pardon. Farewell.    

       Mr. Ewing is perhaps the most conspicuous man in this State at the present time, unless Judge McLean be an exception. Although he has been in Congress but a single session, he has acquired a high reputation as a statesman. He is agreeable in his social intercourse rather inclined to be what some would term 'jovial.' His countenance is strongly marked. He is very large and corpulent, and would weigh, I should judge, more than two hundred. I should think him to be about forty. He is a self-made man a striking exemplification of what a man can attain to by merely personal effort. He is a native of this State, and was born poor. In his youth, his principal employment was wood-chopping. Being very athletic, he excelled in the labors of the axe. At length, when he had become what would be called, 'a great, overgrown, awkward, brawny young man,' by a fortunate jostle, a desire for an education waked in his bosom he directed his steps to this institution, where he completed his education preparatory to the study of the law. In term-time he chopped wood at the College door and in vacation, it was his custom to swing his axe upon his shoulder, and go forth in search of a job; which he would accomplish, and return with fresh vigor at the commencement of the next term. In this way he sustained himself while in College, and came out with a constitution as vigorous as when he entered.Thus is this hardy son of Ohio climbing his way to the giddy heights of power and I should not be surprised, if at no very distant day, he should plant his foot upon the top-most step in the ascending scale of political distinction. His moral principles, I believe, are regarded as correct. Ed. Ohio Observer.  personal effort   Ed. Ohio Observer   

 The Marshpee Indians. On reading the memorial of these injured people, the remnant of a once great nation, and the rightful owners of an immense territory, but now reduced to a few miserable families, by the oppressions of the white men, we had hoped that a returning sense of justice would have induced the present legislature to unbind the heavy burdens put upon them by the unrighteous enactments of their predecessors. But we fear that our expectations were vain. It seems that nothing is to be done to cancel any part of the debt of ingratitude which we have contracted; and those poor unfortunates, now here sueing for something like justice, are to be sent home with their grievances unredressed, and they again subjected to the tyranny of a set of Vampyres in the shape of agents and overseers. If such is to be their treatment, it is abominable. It is adding insult to injury, it is disgraceful to men calling themselves civilized, and should be reprobated by every person who has the least spark of feeling for his injured fellow-creatures.Let not those guilty of such an act ever again open their mouths on the subject of CHEROKEE injustice. New-England Artisan.

 YEAST. Good housewives, who take delight in sitting sweet and light bread before their families, feel vexed at nothing more than bad yeast; and they are sometimes put to a great deal of trouble in procuring a good article. The following is said to be a good recipe for making it: Boil one pound of good flour and a quarter of a pound of brown sugar, and a little salt, in two gallons of water for one hour. When milk warm, bottle it and cork it close, and it will be fit for use in 24 hours. One pint of yeast will make 18 lbs. of bread.     

 Sir John Fielding, the famous magistrate, who was blind, had a pipe fixed from the carriage to the coach box, through which he could converse with the coachman, without being heard by others. When his carriage was stopped by an obstruction in the streets, he inquired of the coachman what kind of a carriage, &c. occasioned it, and it was his humor then to put out his head, and shout out in his usual peremptory tone, 'take that cart out of the way;' or 'you, sir, in that chaise, drive on!' This occasioned great astonishment how he who was blind could perceive the cause of the stoppage, and was a source of great amusement to Sir John.     

 Extraordinary Wager. On Tuesday last, an extraordinary but very absurd feat was performed at the Swan Clewer, between two cripples of that village. It appears that a jealousy has been for some time past existing between these worthies as to their respective strength, and as they could only muster two sound legs between them, they after much deliberation, came to the novel determination of deciding which was the best man by seeing which could stand the longest time upon his sound 'pin' without resting. Both parties accordingly met at the above place at one o'clock, and put themselves in the duck-like posture agreed upon, and in that position they remained till half past nine, when the loser fainted away. Berkshire Chronicle.

 Something in a Name. Mr. Salt, the American traveller, used to tell of himself, that at his birth, his father meant to name him Peter, but a friend of his objected to the name, alleging that when he went to school, he would get no other appellation but Saltpetre.

 Shocking Casualty. Mr. Charles C. Cohen, a respectable chemist, was killed on Saturday morning, at his factory in Hamilton street, while engaged in the preparation of fulminated mercury. He had just thrown additional fuel in the furnace of a water bath, and was in the act of lighting a pan containing some of the undried article, when a spark from the fire is supposed to have ignited it, and a terrific explosion ensued. The concussion produced was so great, that a young man who was ascending a ladder in the other end of the building, was thrown with considerable violence to the ground. When he arose, he observed Cohen lying on the floor, and so shockingly disfigured that he could hardly be recognized. He disengaged the unfortunate man from the rubbish by which he was covered, when Mr. Cohen uttered a piercing shriek, and exclaimed, 'throw water on my face!' His right arm was projected through the roof to the adjoining coal yard; his left eye was blown from the socket, his brain materially injured, and his body dreadfully mutilated. His right arm, which was broken in two places, was amputated by Dr. Rogers, but he died about four o'clock in the afternoon, leaving a wife and three young children entirely destitute. New-York Standard.

 In grappling for a lost anchor in the Hudson river, a little below West Point, a number of links were brought up, which formed a part of the great chain stretched across the Hudson river during the revolutionary war, to prevent the British fleet from passing up to West Point. The number of links recovered is fifty one; they are said to be over a foot each in length, and averaging from thirty to forty five pounds each in weight. They are supposed to have diminished one third in size and weight by corrosion, and were raised with difficulty, in consequence of their close adhesion to the bottom. They were so imbedded with the rocks below, that it took three days hard pulling to bring them up, and large stones adhered to them, some weighing from fifty to twenty pounds each. The fifty-one links weighed 1500 lbs. A certificate of these facts is published in the New-York papers, and one of the links has been presented to the New-York Naval Lyceum.     

 Paris, Dec. 24. We learn by the Neapolitan Journals that, up to the 1st inst., Vesuvius continued to emit flames and liquid fire. There have been two new openings formed in the old crater towards Camaldules and Torre del Greco. One of the currents of lava has taken a direction towards the plain of Genetta, and the other towards Bosco tre Case. The subterranean reports have, however, ceased, and a thick column of smoke issues forth, forming itself at the top into the shape of a mushroom, and the clouds of which, carried away by the currents of air, present a very curious appearance.

 Stereotype Printing. From a report published by the Dutch government, it appears that this ingenious art was invented so long ago as the year 1700, by John Muller, minister of the German reformed church at Leyden. His first method was that of soldering the types together after the page was composed; but afterward he had plates cast from a plaster-of-Paris, or metal mould, as done at this day. He and his son published various works printed in this manner. It is extraordinary that the art was afterwards suffered to fall into oblivion, and was re-invented a century later. See Notice in Foreign Quarterly Review.

 Portuguese Vintage. The wine vineyard stretched its dreary length along the whole extent of the hill behind the Quinta the stunted vines, tightly attached to short poles, were barely two feet in height, and infinitely less attractive in appearance than a field of goosebury-bushes the vintagers were there the rabble of the province; many of them half naked, all them filthy, and most of them ruffianly in appearance to the extreme degree. And the women were worthy of their associates disgusting, dirty, and drunken! The bullock-cars were there also; creaking and groaning as the huge beasts moved forward to escape the goad of their impatient driver. And this was a vintage!   Portuguese Vintage Quinta   

 Ephraim Pierce, a colored man, employed as a porter for the steamboat of the New-York Rail Line, found a few days since, in Chesnut street, a bundle of bank notes amounting to five hundred dollars. He carried the money immediately to the agent of the Company, and asked advice as to the proper mode of procedure. He was advised to advertise it in the papers of the next morning, if those of the afternoon just about to issue, had no notice of the loss. The loss was advertised. Ephraim hastened to the loser like an honest man; and the owner was happy in rewarding him with a fifty dollar note.     

 John Tappan, Esq. of Boston, in his late letter to Albany, says: 'Nearly all the wine used at the communion table in our country, I have good reason to believe, is made in this country, of the vilest materials; and one dealer boasted the other day of having sold such wine for the sacred purpose, and I have his name.'SECRET PRAYER. Secret prayer, said the celebrated Dr. Hunter, like the melody of a sweet toned voice stealing upon the ear, gently wafts the soul to heaven; social worship, as a full chorus of harmonized sounds, pierces the sky, and raises a great number of kindred spirits to the bright regions of everlasting love, and places them together before the throne of God.Mr. T.

           A mental feast is a convocation of rational beings, who come together not to feast upon the delusive pleasures of the bowl, or the table, which are but mere animal gratifications, shared alike by senseless brutes; but to enjoy the sublime and exalted pleasures of intellectual cultivation and improvement.A mental feast consists in mind feasting upon rational ideas, in which every guest contributes and receives in proportion to the endowments of the understanding.In mental feasts we partake of the sublimer bounties of our heavenly Father, and we are thereby made stronger to do his will and to serve him in his spiritual kingdom; and thus we become better prepared for the society of angels, and the spirits of the just made perfect in heaven. Let these convocations, then, be always conducted with a direct reference to our dependence upon God, from whom alone cometh every good and perfect gift; and let it be the principal concern at all those meetings, that the cause of God may be promoted, and his great name glorified.Our colored female friends, in divers places, have adopted the practice of holding mental feats. While many of their fairer and more privileged sisters are spending their precious time at the theatre or the ball-room, they, more rational and wise, are cultivating those qualities of the soul which are indispensable requisites for the enjoyment of heaven. Let the fair daughters of Columbia take example from those, whom too many have regarded as unworthy of their notice; and let a more rational system of amusement be universally introduced in every grade of society, and the angels of God will witness and record the improvement with complacency and delight.

 By a colored female.             DEAR FRIENDS, These monthly assemblies, I believe, are not confined to any particular class or sex: they are to improve the mental condition of all who feel disposed to participate in the knowledge of piety, truth and justice: and it is my sincere wish, that through the many exertions which have been made for our moral improvement, pride and prejudice may ere long cease. But it is with feelings of sorrow that I say things of this character too strongly exist among ourselves. With all the persecutions and difficulties which we have had to encounter, we are estranged one from another. Tell me, my friends, are these things to last much longer? Must I reluctantly say, that persecutions of a deeper dye will be the only means of blotting them from the page of memory? Heaven forbid! What heart has not already keenly felt the stings of our persecutors?Let me earnestly entreat of you all, when kneeling beside your couch at even, invoking blessings from our Supreme Benefactor, not to forget the slaves. The cruel manner in which they are chained, driven, and sold like beasts of the field, should ever excite in us feelings of sympathy. Yes, my friends, what tongue can express, what heart conceive their unceasing sufferings? Often has my blood changed to icy chillness, my heart throbbed with sorrow and compassion, when reading or hearing of their extreme wretchedness; and I would exclaim within myself, 'What can be done to relieve them?' I fear, nothing nothing to close this scene of misery. Yet I will not despair. God is all-sufficient his hand is ever ready to succor the weak and needy; and may the prayers of our zealous and ever dear advocates ascend like sweet incense to the throne of grace, and their labors diffuse light and knowledge throughout the world.Philadelphia, Feb. 7th, 1834.

 THE USE OF TOBACCO A GREAT EVIL. Messrs. Editors: I am a plain man, a farmer; unaccustomed to write, especially for the press. Yet believing as I do that the use of tobacco is a great evil, and calls loud upon the christian public for reformation: that no professor of religion can habitually make use of it without incurring guilt; and that ministers and churches ought to be thoroughly awake on this subject; and hoping to escape the strictness of the critical reader, if you will occasionally grant me a short space in your columns, (although inadequate to the task,) I feel constrained to send you a few thoughts, together with some facts connected with the use of this loathsome, intoxicating weed.I am aware that the subject is a delicate one; that ridicule, and sarcasm, are often connected with it; but my only request is, a serious, conscientious, impartial examination; accompanied with a sincere desire to know and follow the path of duty.The evil arising from the use of Tobacco may be seen by the effects produced on its votaries 'The tree is known by its fruit.'Tobacco has an intoxicating quality: and the man who is constantly under its influence, is to some extent intoxicated. He is under an unnatural excitement; without it, he is lost, he sinks, his spirits and his strength fail, and he is unable profitably to pursue any kind of labor, or business, until his usual tone of feeling is restored by an application of the intoxicating drug. If a man may be as really intoxicated by the use of tobacco, as the use of ardent spirits; and the effect produced, is in consequence of the indulgence of a beastly appetite; where is the great difference in the criminality?The raised tone of feeling in the man who makes constant use of tobacco, and the daily moderate drinker, may justly be considered very near equal. Tobacco is injurious to the animal system. For proof of this position, I have the testimony of many respectable witnesses, male and female, one of which I will mention. 'I used tobacco,' said an aged man, 'until I lost the principal part of my teeth. My appetite was gone, a general debility, and relaxation of the nerves forced me to abandon the practice. The effect was salutary. My appetite returned, my health and strength were restored; and with few exceptions continued to the present time, through a lapse of near fifty years.'Ohio Observer.

       No Powel-street, between  , and 6th streets, and between Pine & Spruce      GRATEFUL for the liberal patronage received, and soliciting a continuance of the same, offers his services and advice in all cases of disease, having been successful in practice, and having a general experience in Medical Botany.He offers his vegetable preparations to the public, viz. Lobelia, 1st, 2d and 3d preparation; Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 Slippery Elm Bark; Composition Powders; Nerve Powders; Cough Powders; Fever Powders; Tooth Powder; Vegetable Powder for headache; Cancer Salve, and others used for any kind of sores; Strengthening Plasters; Em Tincture; Vermifuge, very pleasant to the taste; Asthmatic Tincture; Redetic Liniment; Rheumatic Drops; Toothache Drops; Anti-Mercurial Syrup, which cures radically all diseases arising from impurities of the blood, mercurial diseases, scrofula, &c.; Dr. Gardiner's Pulmonic Syrup for colds and coughs; with several Indian Preparations for consumption, rheumatism, &c. These medicines will cure the following diseases Cramp, gout, rheumatism, hooping cough, croup, asthma, pleurisy, dysentery, worms, summer complaints so destructive to children, dyspepsia, or indigestion, the causes of decay or consumption, St. Anthony's fire or erysipelas, liver complaints, gravel, chills or fever and ague, billious remittant; and, in short any kind of fevers, or any complaint, readily yield to these vegetable medicines kings evil, dropsy, nervous affections, measles, small pox, &c.Dr. Gardiner is aware that there are many spurious remedies offered every day to the public, and that many, anxious to obtain relief, have been deceived by such imposition[ ] and from that circumstance may be inclined to treat these medicines as another imposition. He is also aware of the force of the prejudice of education, and predilectionsin favor of popular opinions and customs in medicine, &c. To such he will observe, that he does not say that they are infallible in every case; but he solicits for them a fair trial and they who make use of them in one disease, will prefer them in every other complaint; and to those who shall take them and follow the directions strictly, for a specified time, and receive no essential benefit, the money that they paid for them shall be returned. And he conscientiously asserts without fear of successful contradiction, that these medicines are purely botanic, and possess no poisonous mineral or deleterious principles. In corroboration of these assertions he offers a few names of persons well known in whose families and among whose acquaintance his medicines have been used with success, to whom persons interested may refer.

            THIS 'Syrop' is offered as a Sovereign Remedy for Colds, Coughs, Asthma Spitting of Blood all diseases of the breast and lungs, and indeed every thing leading to Consumption. It is equally effectual in removing Scrofula, King's Evil, Tetter, and all those affections that originate in the impurity of the blood. To those who may be afflicted with any of these troublesome affections, a trial is only necessary to convince even the most incredulous of the efficacy of its powers and it may be taken in the most delicate state of health, being purely a combination of Herbs, Roots, Plants, &c. &c. The proprietor of this 'Syrop' does not recommend it in the general style, by saying it has made a Thousand Cures, or that she can produce Hundreds of Certificates; but she can only say from experience, (the only sure test,) that it will effectually relieve and remove those complaints she has named above The proprietor of the 'Syrop,' however, will subjoin the following certificates from persons who have been relieved by it, and in the manner they have stated, and who have not had any return of their symptoms up to this time. She could furnish many more to show the efficacy of the 'Syrop,' but she thinks that these will have the effect of inducing those who may be laboring under any of the complaints she has mentioned to try it, which is all she asks; being fully satisfied that whenever it has a trial, its virtues will be acknowledged and its credit established.  and who have not had any return of their symptoms up to this time    E. MOORE, Philadelphia. Philadelphia   MRS. MOORE, I make the following statement from a hope of being serviceable to those of my fellow creatures who may be affected as I have been. It is now more than five years since I was first attacked with scrofula. Nearly five years of the time I had the advice and attendance of some of the most skilful physicians of this city. Their skill availed nothing: on the contrary, the disease gained ground daily, and, at the time I commenced taking your Syrop Les Herbe, I was a distressing object to look at, and the pain I suffered was almost beyond endurance. It is now about six weeks since I first began to take your syrop, and have had about five bottles, and all pain has ceased and every vestige of the disease has disappeared. Any person who wishes to be satisfied of the truth of this statement, have only to call at my house, and see me, when they will be satisfied with my present appearance, and I can easily satisfy them as to what my appearance was but a short time ago.MRS. STAKELY, Opposite 19 Cox's Alley. Philadelphia, January 24, 1833.MRS. MOORE, Having received such decided relief from your Syrop Les Herbe. I feel it my duty to make it known to the public. In the fall of 1831, I took a severe cold, and it settled on my breast. I tried every thing, but without obtaining any relief I continued this way until March last, when I commenced taking the 'Syrop;' and after taking two bottles I was so far restored as to discontinue its use, and I have had no return of the symptoms since.
