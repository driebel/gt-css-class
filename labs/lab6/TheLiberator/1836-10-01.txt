 After the many disinterested efforts of the Boston Recorder, Vermont Chronicle, &c. to crush the Liberator, it is pleasing to find that our abolition brethren are not to be weaned from their attachment to our paper. See the approval of the Essex County Anti-Slavery Society in the preceding page.      

                 (The Committee of the Glasgow Emancipation Society did not feel themselves at liberty to give, at an earlier period after the late discussion between Mr. Thompson and Mr. Breckinridge, any public declaration of their judgement relative to the merits and results of that discussion, in as far as the character and conduct of the former of these two gentlemen were implicated. In the spirit of one of the conditions of the discussion, namely, that no vote should be taken at the close expressive of the mind of the audience, they delayed convening a public meeting, for the purpose of expressing their own judgment, and calling for the concurrence of their fellow citizens, till some time had been allowed for the circulation and perusal of the controversy, as issued from the press. They now, however, consider it incumbent upon them, a duty they owe to Mr. Thompson as their known and accredited Agent, and a duty which they owe to themselves and others by whom he was engaged and commissioned to give publicity to their sentiments: and it is to their minds a source of no small satisfaction, that, judging coolly and deliberately, they can pronounce a verdict favorable, in all respects, to their esteemed Agent and friend, without hesitation and without reserve. For the terms of that verdict, they refer to the first of the resolutions passed at the meeting of which an account follows. That resolution was moved and seconded by the two ministers of the gospel, Vice Presidents of the Society, by whom the chair was filled during the discussion; by one of them at four, and by the other at one of the meetings. While these gentlemen felt it their duty to maintain the strictest impartiality, in presiding on such an occasion, by withholding every indication of their own opinions, and showing equal favor to each of the combatants, they are now exonerated from official restrictions, and entitled, in common with others, to avow their judgment.)    

       The Middlesex County Anti-Slavery Society will hold its Annual Meeting at Lowell, on Wednesday, the 5th day of October next, at 10 o'clock, A.M. The meeting will be in the Free Church. Public addresses of an interesting character may be expected in the afternoon and evening.     JAMES T. WOODBURY, Sec'y.   Sept. 24, 1836.    

 On Monday night, a public meeting of the members and friends of the Glasgow Emancipation Society was held in the Rev. Dr. Heugh's Chapel, for the purpose of expressing the sentiments of the Society in reference to the recent discussion on American Slavery, so far as Mr. Thompson is concerned; their approbation of his conduct in the United States; their unabated confidence in him as their Agent; and their unalterable attachment to the great principle of immediate, unconditional, and universal emancipation.Shortly after seven o'clock, the place of meeting was filled with a numerous and highly respectable audience. About half-past seven the Committee entered the chapel, and were received with cheers.On the motion of the Rev. MR. M'TEAR, Robert Graham, Esq., of Whitehill, was called to the Chair by acclamation.The CHAIRMAN having briefly stated the object of the meeting.The REV. DR. WARDLAW said, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen Before I proceed to move the resolution which I hold in my hand, allow me to congratulate the meeting on the cheering recollections which this evening brings along with it; recollections which ought to draw forth the utterance of benevolent joy and of devout gratitude from every British bosom. It is the first of August. And who does not recollect the animation with which the friends and advocates of freedom hailed, two years ago, the arrival of this day the day on which the edict of the government took effect for the emancipation, from the yoke of degrading and wretched bondage, of 800,000 of the colored population of our colonial dependencies. We hailed the day as the British Jubilee, when the trumpet which 'proclaimed the liberty of the captives' was sounded far and wide, through the whole extent of Britain's dominions. There were drawbacks, it is true. The boon was not so perfect as we had wished it. The liberty granted was trammelled by the expedients of a timid policy a policy which experience, so far from justifying has abundantly proved unsound; giving an additional evidence to the thousands which all history furnishes, that when we have once demonstrated a principle to be correct to be in accordance with the will of God, and the inalienable rights of men, our safest way is to keep a firm grasp of that principle, and to act it out with a fearless reliance on that Being by whom it is sanctioned and enjoined. The straight forward path of duty will always be found the path of ultimate security. I do not mean by this, that it was at all an indispensable evidence of the rectitude of our principle, when we were seeking the immediate emancipation of the slaves in our colonies, that be act of emancipation should be followed either by none of those disturbances (to give them their gentlest designation,) which the opponents of our measure dreaded, or affected dread, or by none of those fatal effects to property and produce which were also so confidently and gloomily predicted. No, Mr. Chairman, for my own part I should not have been shaken from my conviction of the rectitude and the authority of the principle, had all, or even more to all of the evils anticipated by those woe-denouncing prophets been realized. I should have regarded them as locations of the divine displeasure against past oppression and of the injurious workings of that detested system which the native tendencies were, to foster all the worst reasons of the human heart, and to set men who had been [ ] and grievously wronged against those by whom their [ ]gs had been inflicted. But, thanks to Heaven, God has been more kind, and the oppressed negro has been patient and forbearing, than such anticipations implied. On the first of August, 1834, I did seem to myself as I heard the voice of Him who rules among the nations, saying to my country 'My own, my native land' 'From this day will I bless thee!' And my hope has not been blasted. Without touching on any questions, respecting which, that is one man's grief may be another's joy, I presume I may say with truth, that, in a mercantile point of view, the country was never in a more prosperous condition; and I presume my West India friends themselves will not contradict me, when I further say, that even the colonies are holding out a fairer promise than for many a day before. Sir, while we wrought for the freedom of the negro, under the influence of those principles of justice, and humanity, and religion, which are unchanging as the nature of God, and vary not with time, or place, or circumstances, yet we wrought, at the same time, in the full conviction that our West India friends, in opposing us, were standing in their own light, and arguing and contending against their own interests. They alleged that we were doing what lay in our power to ruin them; we felt the full assurance that they would find themselves mistaken that they would reap benefit rather than injury, profit rather than loss. They alleged that we were seeking to drive upon fatal rocks the distressed and imperiled vessel, and to ensure her shipwreck with the loss of cargo, and of all hands on board. We saw the laboring ship already water-logged, on her beam ends, and ready to founder; and our efforts were directed, not to send her down, but to right the vessel, to save cargo and crew, and to give her a safe and prosperous run for the remainder of her voyage. We felt confident that we were taking the right way to effect this; and so far as two years' experience has gone, we can appeal to our opponents whether we have not been in the right.And, Mr. Chairman, had we got all our own way, we should have proved still more in the right. The full benefit of our labors in the cause, has been prevented by the clumsy, though it may be granted, well intentioned measure of apprenticeship; a measure which, while it took the fetters but half if so much as half off the hapless slave, imposed bonds upon the beneficial working of the true principles of emancipation. We have both positive and negative proof of this. We have positive proof of the correctness of our principles and calculations in the only two instances in which the gift of liberty has been freely and fully bestowed in the Islands of Antigua and Bermuda; and we have this positive proof supported by the negative of the same peace, and concord, and happiness, and productiveness, (the fault, however, not of the negro, but of those who have taken advantage of the power which his new position still gave to his masters,) where the measure has been clogged and embarrassed by the vain devices of human expediency, and the precautions of an unfounded apprehensiveness. Sir, I cannot but anticipate the day when the irritations of the past having been softened down the asperities of controversy having been abated by time, we shall obtain in lieu of the frowns and maledictions, the smiles, and thanks, and blessings of our West India friends. You may think, perhaps, sir, that they will never have grace to thank us. Well, it may be a little against the grain, but we shall see: it is not time yet. As it was not for their thanks that we wrought, we shall not feel much bitterness of disappointment, should we fail of obtaining them. We shall try to rejoice in their prosperity, whether they thank us for it or not.I bless God, Mr. Chairman, for the degree in which our cause has triumphed. But, while we do not forget our obligations to Divine Providence, neither must we overlook the human instruments employed by that Providence in the attainment of the end. And this evening we have to express our obligations to one of these. It has been by the combined, earnest, persevering voice of public opinion reiterating in the ears of our government not on the ground of mere political expediency, but on the higher and more sacred ground of moral and christian principle the demand for the breaking of the yoke of the oppressed, and the raising of the enslaved and degraded, to the dignity of men, and to the rights and the privileges of freemen, that our cause has triumphed. We owe not a little, then, to those friends of that cause, who have contributed to enlighten and enliven the public mind to give it a just impression of wrong, and a clear perception of right to rouse its indignation against the one and fix its benevolence in the resolute determination to effect the other. And amongst those to whom, on this ground, obligation ought to be felt and expressed by us, the subject of the resolution I am about to propose to you, holds no inferior place. He exerted a power over the public mind of no ordinary amount. He brought up the cause in our own city, when it had long languished for want of adequate stimulation. He put new life into it; and he kept that life in vigor till the conquest was achieved. We shall not soon forget the triumphant result of his controversy, maintained in this our city, hand to hand, foot to foot, with the phalanx of the colonial interest headed at that time by their own chosen champion but a champion whom, for their own sakes, I forbear to name as I believe they are all as much ashamed of him as we could wish them to be. With the ability, the zeal, the eloquence, the energy, the steadfastness of principle, the exhausting and indefatigable perseverance of our champion, we were more than satisfied. We expressed our satisfaction; and we expressed it not in words merely, but practically. The most decided and flattering proof that can be given of satisfaction with an agent whom we have employed in one work, is to set him to another. We did so. He had done his duty so nobly in the home department of the great cause he had at heart, that, when we had achieved our object in the disenthralment of the slaves in our own dependencies, and we looked abroad upon the world for other fields of philanthrophic effort, we naturally and unanimously turned our eyes to him, believing that he who had done so well at home, would do equally well abroad.Sir, when we began with our own columns, we never meant to stop there. That was not the limit of our desires, or of our determinations. Our field was the world. Our object was universal freedom; the breaking of every yoke the deliverance of the oppressed in 'every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.' And in contemplating this comprehensive object, whither was it to be expected we should first look? Whither but to America? There, there existed the greatest amount of the accursed evil, whose extermination we desired: and, in that country, both as Britons and as Christians, we could not but feel a special interest. There was no unwarrantable interference. It is always warrantable it is more, it is morally incumbent for fellow-men, if they have opportunity, to expostulate with fellow-men for fellow-christians to expostulate with fellow-christians when they see evils existing, of which all the principles of justice, humanity, and religion, demand the extirpation. There are no considerations of international delicacy and etiquette that can justify connivance at sin on the part of those who have aught whatever in their power to accomplish its removal. If we fail to bring this power, whatever it may be, into operation, we become socii eaminis, partners in the guilt. On this principle, if our American brethren saw any thing in us, which they thought, and justly thought was an evil of sufficient magnitude to induce their kind offices for its suppression, we ought to feel obliged by their using their endeavors to stir us up to a due consideration of it, and to practical efforts for its removal. On the ground, then, the broad ground of universal philanthropy, which allows no man to say, 'Am I my brother's keeper?' we looked to America. On the ground of the Trans-Atlantic States owing their origin to Britain, and being kindred blood with ourselves, we looked to America. On the ground of their having derived their very slavery from us, and having had it fostered by our example, we looked to America. And when thus, in common with our brethren in the Northern and Southern Metropolis, we looked to America, and resolved on a mission of benevolence to that land, all eyes simultaneously looked to George Thompson, as the man, of all others most eminently fitted for the charge of the important and difficult trust. We sent him to America. We sent him, however, be it remembered, in accordance with invitations received by himself from associated friends in the same cause on that side of the Atlantic. Not that such invitation was necessary to justify his mission. It was not. He might have gone from us without any intimation of their wishes. We do not wait till the heathen send to us for missionaries. We send them uninvited. On the same principle might we have sent our anti-slavery missionary. But it was better, and it was providential that, while we were resolving to send, they asked him to come. He went. He went with the best wishes of the benevolent, and the fervent prayers of the pious. He remained in the faithful, laborious and perilous execution of the commission entrusted to him, as long as it could be done without the actual sacrifice of life till it would have been the insanity of hardihood to have persisted longer. He returned. We hailed his arrival. We privately and publicly testified our approbation of the course he had pursued. The present question is are we now prepared to retract that approbation? Has the ordeal through which our friend and commissioned agent has recently passed, altered our minds, and disposed us to substitute for it a sentence of condemnation? Are we now ready to cashier him, to censure him, to send him to Coventry, to deprive him of his commission, and declare him disqualified for ever holding another, unworthy of all future service? I express my own judgment in the shortest of all monosyllables: I say, No; and the resolution which I hold in my hand, calls upon you to say No. I consider the recent controversy as having yielded only fresh ground for confidence; as having fully proved that the challenge he had issued was no empty bravado, but it was founded in conscious sincerity, in the fullest conviction of rectitude of principle of truth, of facts, of force of argument, and of a fair prospect, not of mere victory, but of benefit to his cause. I shrink not from saying of him thus publicly, what I have said more privately in the Committee, that I consider him, in this as in former controversies, as having borne himself, in every respect, creditably to his character and to his cause; to have established, to the full, his previous statements; to have successfully vindicated his Trans-Atlantic proceedings; to have justified the condemnation of American colonization schemes; and to have fairly fastened the guilt of slavery on the Government and people of the United States; that I consider him, in a word, as having come out of this seven-times-heated furnace unscathed without a 'hair of his head singed, or the smell of fire having passed upon him.' If this meeting are of one mind with me, they will accept the following resolution:'That, in the deliberate judgment of this meeting, the wish announced by Mr. George Thompson to meet publicly any antagonist, especially any minister of the Gospel from the United States, on the subject of American Slavery, or on any one of the branches of that subject, was dictated by a well-founded consciousness of the integrity of his purpose and assurance of the correctness of his facts: and that the recent discussion in this city, between him and the Rev. R.J. Breckinridge, of Baltimore, has left, not merely unshaken, but confirmed and augmented, their confidence in the rectitude of his principles, the purity of his motives, the propriety of his measures, the fidelity of his statements, and the straight-forward honesty and undaunted intrepidity of his zeal.'It is far from being my intention, Mr. Chairman, to go through the controversy, and to comment on its various branches. Far less do I mean to give utterance to a single word disrespectful, unfriendly, or unkind, towards the Rev. Gentleman who stood forward as his opponent. I give that gentleman all credit for sincerity, although I think him mistaken. I give him credit for personal and ministerial character and respectability; and while I cannot but condemn the contumelious and sarcastic bitterness of some of his personalities, and whilst I conceive him to have failed in argument on every point that was worth contending for, yet I give him credit too for talent, and tact, and shrewdness, and great general information and ability. His failure was owing, not to any deficiency in these and other qualifications, but to the intrinsic badness of his cause. Let me add, that I give him credit too for his spirit of patriotism, by which he was induced to offer himself to the vindication of his country. I can only say and I say it, because I conceive him to possess mental qualities, and a weight of influence, such as, in a good cause, might fit him for eminent usefulness, O that that patriotism were guided by other principles! That, under the conviction that 'righteousness exalteth a nation, and that sin is the reproach of any people,' and that every moment of the wilful continuance of sin is a moment of guilt and danger, he would throw the weight of his influence into the right scale, and make them tell on the true welfare of America, by making them tell on the immediate annihilation of the evil, or rather of the frightful combination of evils, in the oppression of enslaved millions; the instant removal of the accursed thing from the midst of the camp! This would be patriotism. I shall live in the hope that Mr. B. may yet see and feel it to be so; and that, like another Dr. Cox, he may carry with him, from this country, the full spirit of liberty, and set himself, on his return, to rescue his country from the reproach of all nations for her flagrant inconsistency, and from the gathering vengeance of offended Heaven against practised and tolerated oppression.The question before us now is, whether he made out a good case against Mr. Thompson? and to this question I again answer for you, I hope, as well as for myself No. I think he made out no case against him, either as to the great general principles of his cause, or as to any of the more important details or departments of the discussion. He attempted to show that the slavery of America was not chargeable on America as a nation. I, for one, was amazed at the attempt; triumphantly as I conceived Mr. Thompson to establish the charge he had brought, there did not seem to me any need for nine grounds of proof. Why should Mr. B. tell us about the limited powers of Congress, and the restraints of delicacy and of honor under which even these limited powers are laid? Why tell us of the distinct legislatures, as to this and other matters, of the various States of the national confederacy; and of their incompetency to interfere with each other, or of the general Government to interfere with any of them? Why tell us of the peculiarities in the legislative enactments of the different States, and the difficulties thence arising? What is all this, and much more, to the purpose? What is all this but an admission, that, on this particular point, whatever it may be in others, the federal constitution of the United States is radically and essentially bad? I must be allowed to apply this designation to any constitution that contains not within itself the power of grappling with and putting down great and flagrant iniquities. To vindicate the continuance, for one day, of the slavery and oppression of two millions and a half of immortal fellow-creatures, in a country, too, boasting of its unrivalled freedom, on the ground that the constitution of the Government of that country is such, as not to admit of its being interfered with; my wonder is, that any man could stand forward and tell us this, and not 'blush and hang his head' to own himself an American. What are national sins, if those are not such which arise from the very constitution of a nation's Government? For what is a nation answerable, if not for its constitution? And if that constitution is defective and wrong, where, if not with the nation, lies the sin of its not being mended of the deficiency not being supplied of the wrong not being rectified? If the constitution of America is confessedly such that it cannot authoritatively put forth its powers for the abolition of iniquities, and cruelties, and abominations, so flagrant and atrocious as are comprised in a system of slavery so woefully extensive let America the country, the nation, the people of America, rulers had ruled, if republicans will admit the distinction let America bear the disgrace, and bear the guilt.The proceedings of the Abolitionists of America were assailed in the course of the discussion, in no measured terms of severity. It is needless to say that, whether justly or unjustly assailed, it is not Mr. Thompson alone that is answerable for them. He followed out principles sanctioned at home. He followed out instructions received from home. I am not aware of any point in which he went beyond the terms of his commission. I speak, of course, of the great general features of his procedure. And in these, and in the minuter details, moreover, he acted in alliance with societies there, holding the same principles with ourselves. If there has been blame, then, we and they must share it with him. So far as I have yet seen, I have no objections. The question now is have you?To me it appears, that the question respecting the propriety or the impropriety of the measures of the Abolitionists will be found to resolve itself very much into another into a question of principle. The principle to which I refer, is the principle of our own association the principle (to use a convenient term which had been coined for it) of immediatism. If the principle of gradual abolition be the right principle, then the measures were undoubtedly wrong as far as possible wrong. But if we, are right in our principle of immediate abolition, I see not how Mr. T. and his associates on the other side of the water, could well have acted otherwise than they have done. This seems to me the turning point; and of this Mr. T's opponent appeared to be sensible, when he urged so repeatedly the unreasonableness the infatuation, as he plainly thought it of insisting upon the change being made instantly, independently of all regard to consequences. Now, Mr. Chairman, I was once a gradualist. It was in the earliest stages of our own controversy. I will not trouble you with the reasons which then satisfied my conscience. They do not satisfy it now. I now hold, and blush not to avow notwithstanding Mr. B's evident astonishment that it should be held and avowed by any reasonable man the principle of doing, and doing immediately, whatever the law of God, in spirit and in precept, demands, without regard to consequences. The most unreasonable of all principles, in my apprehension, is that which sanctions continuance in sin, and waits in anticipation of a distant day, and a position of circumstances, in which it will become right to relinquish it right to cease from evil! My principle is simply this abandon sin, do duty, and leave results with God. There are no imaginable circumstances in which it can be right or necessary to break the law of God, in order to avoid evil. Duty is ours; consequences his. It is a matter of principle; and when we have ascertained a principle to be right, it is not requisite that we should also ascertain, before we venture to act upon it, whether it may be acted upon with safety. We, however, have found, in our experience, that it may. God has taught us this lesson; may our trans-Atlantic friends learn it, and act upon it! And if with them the evil has been sanctioned by the constitution of their country, and on this ground compensation to whatever amount, should be deemed equitable Mr. B. boasted of their freedom from taxation (consistently or inconsistently with himself is not the present question) and somewhat exultingly contrasted in this respect, America with Britain. If heavily-taxed Britain, then, amidst all her burdens, could part with her twenty millions for the attainment of her benevolent end, how much may not be spared for the same purpose by untaxed America! Here let them emulate us, if they will. I, for one, shall be well pleased, if they follow us in every thing but the ill-omened apprenticeship. I hope our experience will be a warning to them against this; and teach them to go right through with the business at once. I hold not only emancipation, but immediate emancipation, as a point of clear natural right; of right, I mean, to the slave. Let me, for illustration, suppose an analogous case: Suppose I had property in my hands which I knew to be the rightful hereditary patrimony of a young man, in whose principles I had but little confidence, and who, I had cause to fear, might, if he had it, make but a sorry use of it. It might, in some respects, be desirable that I should keep the property for a time in my own hands, if there was a prospect of his being disposed by and by to make a use of it more for his own credit and benefit. But the property is his. He knows this; and he demands it. Have I a right to retain it? Certainly not. I may, if you will, reason the matter with him, and try to persuade him that, for a time, it would be better for himself, more for his interest, that it should remain with me. But farther I cannot go. If he persists in the demand, I must give it him. Now sir, liberty is property property inalienable but by crime, or by the direct interposition of the will of Heaven. A man's person is property property which, except by the punitive visitation of God, can never be lawfully held by another than himself. The slaves desire and demand their liberty and their persons; they have a right to them in the law of nature and of God; it is not for us it is not for any man to say they are not capable of making a good use of them; and therefore they must not have them yet. They are rights of which they should never have been deprived; rights which ought to be restored; and for the use they make of them, they must become themselves responsible. Such is the plain principle of the case. And experience in many instances and even on the large scale of our own Colonial transactions has taught, that the apprehensions entertained on this subject, have had little or no solid foundation. Every one must have been struck with the identity of the whole strain of argument in the recent Discussion, about the necessity of training and preparation; or endeavoring to satisfy owners and masters, of their interest and their duty; of precautions to be taken; of instructions to be communicated; of habits to be formed; and of many other things to be done, before it could be safe, and consequently before it could be right, to emancipate. We were used to this. We had had it to satiety to nausea; and we should have had it, Mr. Chairman, to this hour, and for years and generations to come, had we not taken, firmly and determinedly, the ground of immediate, entire, and unconditional emancipation. We did this. We gained our point. And where are the anticipated horrors? And our ground has not changed. It is a matter of principle and of right still; and, therefore, we are immediatists in America, as we were in the West Indies. Mr. Thompson's mission has been called a failure. Those who think there is no success unless the end be fully attained at once, may call it so if they will; but the formation of 600 abolition societies, comprising, I believe, more than 30,000 members; the extensive infusion of the spirit of abolition into the bosoms of so many influential ministers and laymen, and of the rising youth of the colleges and seminaries of instruction, as well as into so considerable a number of the public journals these, and other things, speak a different language tell a different tale. But I cannot enlarge here, without taking up ground that belongs to another, by whom it will be occupied with more efficiency.There is but one other point, Mr. Chairman, to which I wish to advert. Mr. Thompson had given us, before the late discussion, very affecting, humbling, shocking details, in proof that in America, slavery was, to a sad extent, the sin of the church. Now, Sir, if there was any one point on which, more than on the rest, Mr. T. was successful in establishing his statements, and clearing himself from every imputation of injustice, unfairness, and exaggeration, this was that point. The documentary evidence adduced on the last night of the controversy, contained disclosures which gave him an appalling triumph. I could not but be pleased, to see our friend so successfully vindicate his integrity; but oh! the satisfaction was fearfully darkened by the nature of the facts! To vindicate the ministers and churches of America, was avowed as one of Mr. B's principal objects. In no point did he more signally fail. The defence was feeble, inefficient, and fruitless. The facts against him were overwhelming.And here, Sir, let me say, there rests an obligation, most imperative and solemn, upon the christians and christian churches of our own country. The duty is, to hasten their remonstrances to their erring brethren on the other side of the Atlantic; to rouse them to a proper sense of their sin, and of what the law of God and the Gospel of Christ alike demand of them. Mr. B. has said, that if this subject is much meddled with, and especially if such measures are persisted in as those hitherto pursued, there must be a breaking up of the fellowship of American and British christians. Sir, I prize that fellowship highly; I prize it individually; I prize it collectively. But if it is a fellowship which requires to be maintained by connivance at iniquity and oppression if it is not to be enjoyed, without our entering into a compact to be silent or to be inactive on topics respecting which we feel it our incumbent and indispensable duty to 'lift up our voice like a trumpet,' and show our brethren their sin then I say, with whatever reluctance and whatever pain, let the fellowship cease! I have no conception of that sweet and delightful communion, of which the terms are, silence and compromise, and gentle dealing with crying abominations. I have no relish for a harmony which a word uttered in behalf of oppressed and degraded and suffering millions, would convert into discord, alienation and anarchy. I desire to have no ear for that music, which would be turned to jarring and harshness, if a single chord were touched of sympathy with the unpitied bondman. By maintaining fellowship in such circumstances, and on such terms, we do double wrong. We not only 'suffer sin' in our brethren; we directly encourage it. Let us rather, by faithful remonstrance, 'deliver our own souls,' wash our hands clean. If we retain fellowship without such remonstrance, we contribute in the very strongest way in our power to confirm every light impression of the evil; by renouncing it, we give declaration strong, I admit, but not too strong of our own impression of that evil; and such renunciation, dictated by such a principle, may be the very means of rousing from the lethargy we are solicitous to disturb, and of giving the impulse we are desirous to impart.I must have done. The resolution I have submitted to you, expresses the decided conviction of my own mind. As to the sneers at our agent's not going immediately to the Southern States, it would be foolish to reply to them; as foolish as it would have been for him to have gone. I shall say no more than that such an act of insanity would have shown that we had been mistaken in our man; for, by proving him destitute of common sense, it would have proved him undeserving of our confidence and commission. We no more thought of charging him to go on his arrival in America directly to the Southern States, the seats of trans-Atlantic slavery, than, in the case of our own colonial slavery, we thought of sending him with a commission to the planters and assembly of Jamaica, or to make an emancipation tour through the West India Islands. The one would not have been less absurd and hopeless than the other.I conclude by saying, that, in consequence of the recent discussion, George Thompson, instead of having sunk, has risen in my estimation, both as to personal character and as to official ability, and trustworthiness; and never stood higher in my regard, than he does at the present moment. The resolution will be seconded, and you will then have it in your power to express your concurrence with this estimate, or your dissent from it.The Rev. Dr. was frequently and enthusiastically cheered during the delivery of his address, and sat down amid repeated rounds of applause.The Rev. Dr. Kidston seconded the resolution. He was generally unfond of addressing such meetings as the present, for various reasons; but on this occasion be no sooner knew by whom he was to be preceded than he felt quite relieved. He had anticipated exactly what had occurred namely, that the subject of the resolution would be so amply discussed as to leave nothing for him to add. He would therefore not occupy their time by entering at all upon the subject, lest the impression which had been already made, should be enfeebled by what he might advance. He would only give expression to one idea. The effect which had been produced by Mr. Thompson's lectures on slavery in this country, afforded a practical illustration of the wisdom of the Head of the Church, in appointing preaching as the great means of propagating the gospel. More had been done by Mr. Thompson's lectures, than could have been effected by all the pamphlets it was possible to circulate. He would only add that Mr. Thompson had risen greatly in his estimation in, consequence of the discussion which had taken place a few weeks ago. He was particularly delighted with the last night's proceedings. It had been held out that, as a witness, Mr. Thompson was unworthy of credit relative to the working of the slave system in America, but on that night be completely proved all that he had formerly advanced, and that too on documentary evidence, furnished by Americans themselves. (Cheers.)The resolution having been carried by acclamation, Dr. K. again came forward. He said that in a case such as the present, he thought the better way was for the audience to express their opinion by holding up their hands. The vote was then taken in this way, and the meeting, without a single dissent, acted on the suggestion.The Rev. Dr. Heugh said, he was not in the habit of apologizing for not being prepared to do justice to the resolution with which, on occasions like the present, he might be entrusted. He considered that no one should undertake such a duty, unless he were able to perform it in a proper manner. He was, nevertheless, sorry to say, that such was his situation as he stood before them. Circumstances over which he had no control, had prevented him from bestowing a proper degree of attention to the subject of the resolution which had been given him to propose; but there was one thing which favored him, namely, the great length of the resolution itself, which might well be taken as a substitute for a speech. The Rev. Dr. read the following resolution:'That the Glasgow Emancipation Society considers itself called upon to repeat its unmitigated reprobation of Slavery, as existing in the United States of America, and of that prejudice against color, which is at once a result and support of the slave system: a system which glaringly violates a great principle in the American Constitution, declaring liberty to be the inalienable right of all men; which opposes the spirit and letter of the religion of holy benevolence so extensively professed by the American people, which is productive of an incalculable amount of crime and misery, both among the two millions of slaves, and those by whom they are held in bondage; and which must constantly offend Almighty God, and expose that land to the visitations of his displeasure: that it also repeats the expression of its cordial joy in the rapidity with which the cause of immediate Abolition has spread, and is now spreading in America; in the peaceful, intrepid, and religious spirit, which, amidst good and had report, the American Abolitionists have been enabled to display; and in the near prospect of bloodless triumph with which Divine Providence already animates their efforts and finally, that it resolves anew, along with its many British allies, to remonstrate with the American people in the spirit of fidelity and love, on the claims of the Negro population; to cheer the Abolitionists of America onward in their path of benevolence, until Slavery shall disappear from the American continent, and America and Britain, already united by many powerful ties, shall consistently and indissolubly unite, for the Abolition of Slavery from the face of the earth, and the promotion of the happiness of the whole human family.'In saying a few words in support of the resolution, it would perhaps not be amiss, notwithstanding all they had heard and read on the subject, to set before them anew in the light of truth, the essential evils of slavery, in order to render still more firm and decided their determination to aid the efforts of their trans-Atlantic brethren to remove it. In what light, he would ask them, was slavery viewed by the best writers on the subject? It was viewed as robbery, and that too in the most aggravated form in which robbery could appear under any circumstances. If robbery was to take by violence the property of another, then was slavery the most aggravated kind of robbery. What was it but to take by violence from age, and from youth, and from the feebler sex, that liberty which is the property of every human being? The slaveholder denied to the slave his right in his own body. He said to his victim 'your body is mine as these cattle are mine, and I will use you as I do my cattle,' in the same manner as the robber claimed a property in his booty. From this it appeared evident that slaveholding was just man-stealing. He did not mean to say that every slaveholder stole slaves with his own hands; but he did mean, that by holding slaves he gave such a sanction to the theft as was tantamount to a full participation in it. He was grieved to witness the appeals made by slaveholders to the Scriptures of truth, for a sanction to slavery. Boards of Ministers were to be found who thus turned to the Bible; but unless they could prove that the Bible sanctioned man-stealing, they could never prove that it sanctioned slavery. But slaveholding was not only a crime; it was a crime committed under aggravated circumstances. It was a frightful alliance between power and malignity power triumphing over age, and infancy, and weakness. In America, it was to be seen in its worst form, based on legalized iniquity iniquity under the pretence of law; and there also it was perpetuated from the most sordid motives, the mere love of gain. No doubt when an American was asked why he did not set his slaves free the answer he returned would generally be, that the gift of freedom could not be bestowed on them without danger to society that they would, if relieved from their bondage, first destroy the country and then themselves; but the real motive was the desire of being enriched by means of slave labor. Mammon was at the root of the evil. The question, however, was not at the present day, whether slavery was a crime, and the parent of much evil; but whether its abolition should be effected gradually or at once. It was exceedingly important in this discussion to take hold, and to keep hold, of the admissions made by the anti-abolitionists. By this means they were relieved from the necessity of proving slavery to be an evil; the language of abolitionists on this subject was not stronger than that of their opponents. In order to show this, the Rev. speaker read some passages from a speech of Mr. Breckinridge, in which slavery was denounced as clear robbery, and a host of evils were enumerated as springing out of it. In this manner, continued Dr. Heugh, Mr. Breckinridge admitted the great evil of slavery; but he did not maintain his consistency when pushed hard on the subject. Slavery was an evil; yet when its immediate abolition was advocated, Mr. Breckinridge found out that, partly from the settled habits of the slaves themselves, who knew not what freedom was, and could not appreciate its value, and partly from the extraordinary kindness of masters, the slaves were in more comfortable circumstances than the peasantry of Britain. Passages might be pointed out in Mr. Breckinridge's speeches, in which the home of the American slave was represented as an Elysium, and in which he was said to bless the day on which he was brought to that land of slavery. In this respect the anti-abolitionists somewhat resembled the Irishman, who, when speaking of a row, said that fifteen men had been killed and murdered; but when questioned more closely, acknowledged that they had only got a sound drubbing, and were never a bit the worse for it. But, while he spoke thus of the Americans, he begged at the same time to say, that in some respects they did not, in his opinion, receive full justice from us. The Union was composed of 24 States. In 12 of these slavery was now unknown, 4 of them never having tolerated it at all, and the other 8, comprising the most populous, the most moral, and the most powerful, having long since, abolished it. This they had effected without foreign interference of any kind, and now these States contained a population of 50,000 free negroes. Now he did not hesitate to say America deserved credit for this. If our West India Islands had not been under the control of Britain, when, he would ask, would their slaves have been liberated? There was another point to which he would advert, namely, the rapidity with which abolition principles were spreading in America. When Mr. Thompson left that country, there were 250 abolition Societies. Before he had left Glasgow last, he had received intelligence that these 250 had been doubled; and in a letter just received from Mr. Garrison, it is stated that not fewer than 600 are in existence! He would also remark, that a vast proportion of the piety of America was in what might be called a state of transition on the subject of abolition. He recollected the time when they themselves had their doubts as to the policy of giving the slaves immediate freedom. They were satisfied that slavery ought to be abolished; but they were not prepared to fix a precise time when the work could be completely accomplished. Their minds were not made up as to the propriety of immediate emancipation. A great many excellent men in America were now in the same state of transition; and from what was known of American enterprise and intrepidity, no one would hesitate to believe that they would speedily get out of it. He would now say a few words concerning Dr. Cox; not the Dr. Cox of this country, but the American Dr. Cox. He knew that gentleman well, and had often battled with him on the subject of slavery. Dr. Cox did not hesitate to maintain that the Negro was of an inferior race to the white man inferior from the neck to the heel. But Dr. Cox was in this country inoculated with abolitionism; and when he went to America, it was found be had caught the infection in right earnest. It was to be hoped that Mr. Breckinridge would, in like manner, be made to see the propriety of immediate emancipation; and that we would yet hear from America that Mr. B. was found in the ranks of the abolitionists, and the first among the foremost of them. There was a great difference between the gradual emancipation which some advocated, and immediate abolition. For his part, he feared that gradualism meant neither more nor less than indefinite postponement. At the time when the evils of the slave trade were first brought under public notice in this country, something like gradualism was recommended by those who clung to the trade, Such of those present as could look so far back, would recollect that when Clarkson unfolded the evils of the system, not an individual was to be found directly to defend it. Lord Melville went no farther than to say that its immediate abolition was not practicable, without altogether paralyzing the trade of the country, and giving a severe shake to the national credit. His Lordship professed himself a friend to abolition, but he wished that abolition to be gradual, and complained of Clarkson that he was too hurried. So it was at this day in America. Mr. Breckinridge had spoken of the anxiety felt by many of the Americans for the abolition of slavery, and had said, that if we had only the patience to wait for 20 years or so, some of the present slave States might be found to imitate the eight who have already abolished slavery. But even this prospect, distant as it was, was clouded with a condition. They might abolish slavery in twenty years, 'if they were let alone;' and now that the immediate abolitionists had broken in upon their plans, Mr. B. said abolition had been thrown back at least a century. It thus appeared that gradualism was but another name for indefinite postponement. But there was another consideration in favor of immediate abolition, namely, the shortness of life. In the United States of America, no fewer than 60,000 slaves die annually. Every year that the existence of slavery is prolonged, 60,000 human beings are sent to the grave without having been permitted to taste the sweets of liberty; 60,000 human beings are sent before the throne of the Almighty, to testify against their white oppressors. Were an antediluvian term of life granted to the present generation, a delay of 20 years might be of little consequence; but, restricted as the term of human life now was, it could only be viewed as dashing the cup from the lip. If slavery were the evil which even those who opposed immediate emancipation admitted it to be, to what did delay in putting an end to it amount, but to a delay in leaving off crime? He would say, delay not an instant in ceasing to do evil, in learning to do well. Let them trust to the firm footing of immediate and universal emancipation. For the sake of the slaves for the sake of the American people above all, for the sake of that holy religion, the progress of which was arrested and its honor stained by the existence of slavery they ought never to cease their efforts, till they saw Americans and Britons engaged together in extending the blessings of freedom over the whole earth. Dr. Heugh was greatly cheered as he resumed his seat.The Rev. John Eadie, of Cambridge Street Secession Chapel, on seconding the motion, said The question, sir, to which our attention is turned, is now happily circumscribed. It is not shall the slave trade be abolished? For that nefarious traffic has been declared to be felony. The question is not, shall slavery be mitigated? That too has been decided. Amelioration of slavery is but a compromise with the evil: and gradual abolition the sacrifice of justice and humanity to sordid interest and expediency. The question is not, shall slavery exist in our own colonial dependencies? shall a system which began in an impious violation of the rights of man, and continued on the same foundation a system, in which on the part of the master, lenity was a crime, and sympathy a loss; in which, on the part of the slave, religious knowledge was a suspected possession a system which annually consigned so many victims to an early grave; sent their bodies to the dust, and their spirits to the avenging millions beneath the altar. Shall such a system exist in the British dominions? That question too has been decided; the trumpet of jubilee has sounded; a change has been effected, not the best indeed, but the earnest and presage of entire emancipation. Already the prophetic eye, piercing the dim haze of futurity, sees the happy laborer in the field, no whip behind him, no terror on his brow, no scar on his flesh, no reluctance in his limbs. And the experiment has already proved an attestation to the inspired announcement, that 'we have all one Father, that one God hath created us;' that, in short, all the tribes of the earth are but as streamlets from one fountain, though each may have acquired a peculiar form and color, from the soil it may have traversed, and the rocks and minerals it may have washed. But while this has been accomplished, only a partial victory has been achieved. And is humanity to be content? Is benevolence to slumber? Is the Negro of Jamaica to be free, while his sable brother in America pines in iron bondage? No, sir, philanthropy cares not for distance; shrinks not from opposition; frets not at temporary failure, or partial success. That, sir, is but a selfish emotion, which is circumscribed by country or continent, which waits till its interference be supplicated, or desists when its character may be exposed. Are not we, then, summoned to continued exertion in the cause of immediate, unconditional, and universal emancipation? How many thousands are bound in cruel thraldom, and in a country where the extremes of liberty and despotism confront each other, as if on a fraction of independent neutrality, in a country where unfettered christianity tolerates fettered men, in a country where human rights in their fullest claims exist with human wrongs in their saddest form and infliction. Shall this Society relax in their exertions while one human being groans in fetters especially when millions are enslaved? And while we condole with the sufferer, and sympathise with those who have devoted themselves to the cause of freedom, in the face of christian and republican hostility, shall we not, by correspondence with sister societies by remonstrance and appeal to the volume of unerring truth, endeavor to rouse the American nation to abolish its unhallowed inconsistency, which tarnishes the liberty and the religion it professes to enjoy and revere. Especially let us not be deceived into repose by any attempt to mitigate the horrors of slavery. Slavery cannot be separated from cruelty. The ox may labor the bee gather honey the sheep bear its fleece, and all, as sung the Latin poet, not for themselves the labor of the slave might be as disinterested, had he only their instinct. As long, then, as 'sic vos non vobis,' expresses the similarity of his condition to that of the brute creation, so long must he be urged by cruel compulsion to that task from which he reaps no benefit. More than man, the slave might not be deteriorated by such vassalage; less than man, irrationality would ease him of his woes. Let us not be blinded by any suggestion of expediency which may retard the freedom of the unhappy Negro. If a man rob his fellow, and the robbery be detected, is not instant reparation claimed? Surely then, if a creature defraud his Maker, and the Negro is the property of the Lord of Heaven, shall not immediate and entire restitution be demanded? Our efforts, in reliance on Heavenly aid, though the epoch of triumph be deferred, will at length be successful. A brighter day is in reserve for Africa, and for the world. Whatever may have been their darkness and it has been dense whatever may have been their slavery and it has been galling whatever may have been their superstitions and they have been bloody and degrading a time of liberty and renovation has been promised; when the human family in all its millions of hearts shall be united none so haughty as to be an oppressor none so tame as to be enslaved; but all as happy and harmonious as if Eden still existed, and its walls were co-extensive with the bounds of the globe. (Cheers.)Dr. Heugh read several interesting extracts from letters lately received from Messrs. Lewis Tappan and William Lloyd Garrison. The announcement of the names of these philanthropists was received with enthusiastic cheering.The Rev. D. King moved the third resolution:'That it is of great importance for the friends of freedom in different countries, to co-operate in hastening the extinction of Slavery throughout the world, and that in this conviction the meeting feel much satisfaction in the interchange of friendly acknowledgments that has just passed between the Emancipationists of this city and of Paris.'Sir, I believe that little more is expected of me than to read the following letter from the Duke de Broglie, received in reply to a communication sent by your Committee. The letter is addressed to the Rev. Dr. Heugh:'Mr. Vice President:Sir, I very much regret losing the opportunity of conversing with the Rev. Mr. King and Mr. D. Anderson. The letter which you were so kind as to send me by them, unfortunately did not reach me till after my return from the country. I would have attached great importance to an interview with these members of the Society of Glasgow, which you would desire to place in direct relation with the Society for the Abolition of Slavery in Paris, in which I have the honor to take a part. The instructions that I might have received from them would no doubt have been very precious to me; and on the other hand, we shall joyfully avail ourselves of the means you suggest, of placing at your disposal all the details with which we are acquainted, that may assist you in attaining the exalted end you have in view. Persevering efforts shall not be wanting on our part, for regulating and carrying the important questions relating to the definite emancipation of the slaves. We also consider as one of the purest glories in the history of the world, that of those men who in our country have so powerfully contributed by their unceasing activity as well as by the energy of their talents, to cause the disappearance of Slavery from the territories of England. I pray you accept my expressions of highest regard, &c. &c.                               Now                                      BROGLIE.'   There are, I was given to understand while in Paris, two committees engaged there in the great cause of Negro emancipation. One of these is more religious in its character, and has subsisted for a considerable time; the other is more political, and comprises among its members some of the most eminent men, both of the Chamber of Peers and the Chamber of Deputies. The great want in France is a deficiency of public spirit. It seems characteristic of the French to display in relation to such great questions, extraordinary apathy or extraordinary intrepidity; but between these extremes, there is a scantiness of that calm, thinking, sustained prosecution of national measures, by which, as the history of our own country attests, the essential rights of freedom are most effectively acquired, and most permanently preserved. (Cheers.) In evidence and exemplification of this, I may notice that they are entitled, in common with ourselves, to petition the legislature, yet such petitioning is almost unknown with them. An attempt of the kind was recently made on this very subject of emancipation, and proved, I am sorry to say, a comparative failure. The idea of large public assemblies, such as that I have the honor to address, was found out of the question. The French, it would appear, had no idea of attending meetings where every thing was to be said and nothing was to be done (laughter;) and even when the petition was carried from shop to shop, and dwelling to dwelling, it remained at the last miserably signed. I cannot charge my memory positively with the number of signatures; but, so far as I can recollect, it was somewhere about a thousand. Still the cause is not so now in France, as this fact by itself would readily suggest. Some of the most honored names of the country are the more honorable for being associated with its sincere and strenuous support; and I am safe in saying that no foreign influence will be so powerful as the example of Great Britain in strengthening their benevolent endeavors. This, then, is another great inducement for us to do our duty. Let us prosecute the course on which we have entered, and a nation so capable of great acts of generosity and justice, and so alive to the impulse of noble rivalry, as France, will not remain constantly behind. Sooner or later the slavery of the French colonies will be brilliantly abolished, and we shall find the forces of French philanthropy by our side, if not before us, in the glorious march towards universal emancipation. (Cheers.) Yet, looking at the constitutions of countries, France is not the first we would expect to be forward in this good work. There is one whose principles would lead us to expect earlier and more energetic co-operation in breaking the rod of the oppressor. The American declaration of rights, which declares personal liberty and undoubted and inalienable property, of which man may on no pretext despoil man, seems to promise fair for the most liberal benevolence, and how lamentable, then, is it that America is nevertheless, the great seat of the abhorrent evil which we are laboring to eradicate. (Hear.) Our object is not to cast ourselves into the arms of any party in America, but to promote the general interests of the cause. If we befriend any specially, it is because they specially befriend the negro. I cannot help, however, expressing regret that those called Colonizationists should attempt, by such means as they employ, to obtain the ascendency over those called Abolitionists by violence and defamation. The cut-throat story, I found in the journey to which allusion has been made, has been circulated, on the continent as well as here, and really that story, having its own throat cut by the very satisfactory and well authenticated explanation of Mr. Thompson, should, as confessedly diseased, be entombed as expeditiously as possible. (Laughter.) Supposing, however, such aspersions just what do they prove? They can neither modify the excellence of freedom, nor the hatefulness of bondage you wound the men by them, but their principles are invulnerable. And if those emancipationists we may ask our Trans-Atlantic brethren, are so very contemptible, how comes it that by your own admission, they are so very influential? The mission of Mr. Thompson, it has been asserted, has thrown back the cause for a century. (Hear.) Extraordinary! America was in movement the millions of the North, and the millions of the South, but while this mighty people were in progress, Mr. Thompson, whom they cannot characterise in language sufficiently contemptuous, unfortunately crossed their path, and all farther advancement was precluded, for a century to come! Emancipation is put back, is it, a hundred years? If that be the period of its postponement, I wonder what is the whole period of its destined duration! Surely the respite is long enough of itself. Are successive generations to pass into the tomb, and the babe just born, to transmit the cursed inheritance of bondage, to his children's children, ere error yields to truth, or cruel outrage to compassionate Christianity? The prospect is unendurable. Much will happen in a hundred years, and we shall hope, and pray, and strive that the extinction of bondage be one of the consummations; that before another century has revolved, every chain may be severed, and every captive ransomed, and liberty and humanity stand every where as closely associated in practice as they are inseparable in principle. (Cheers.) One word more about the contemptible abolitionists. You say they are destroying the cause by mismanagement then take it out of their hands and manage it better. They will never be suppressed by opposition; let their efforts then be shaded by efforts yet nobler, and the light of their despised taper lost in purer, brighter, more benignant effulgence.Meanwhile, our duty is plain. While iniquity is maintained, we must in any wise rebuke our neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him. We have stepped forward, and cannot draw back. A respect to truth forbids it fidelity to our Lord forbids it compassion to the enslaved, not a few of whom are brethren in bonds, forbids it our admiration of the better qualities of the American community forbids it. We see much in America to love and imitate many of its institutions many of its worthies but we will not, cannot countenance its slavery. Evasions are vain. It is no fairy scheme of colonization, no subtle, specious pleading that is to lessen our abhorrence of human robbery, or our labors for its annihilation. America has suffered, in the estimate of the wise and good, by transgression, and can be exalted only in righteousness. Instead of banishing, as you propose, the Negro, O banish his thraldom instead of vilifying the abolitionists, outrival their exertions instead of disdaining our interference, listen to christian expostulation; and then, and not till then, may America become what she claims to be the glory, and admiration, and rejoicing of the whole enlightened world. (Cheers.)MR. DAVID M'LAREN, on seconding the resolution, said: I rise with pleasure to second the resolution which has been now proposed, and so ably and eloquently supported. No remarks of mine are required to ensure its cordial and unanimous adoption by this meeting; but I cannot refrain from expressing the delight which I feel, in common I know, with you, Mr. Chairman, and I am persuaded, with every one now present, in the thought that the common bond of brotherhood, instead of being 'severed as the flax that falls asunder at the touch of fire,' is now expressly and publicly recognized; and that the two nations, which in our youth abhorred each other, have mingled into one.It is pleasing to reflect, that while he was describing the evils of slavery, that the sweet christian poet lamented the alienation of man from man in the terms to which I have alluded, the harmonious co-operation over which we rejoice and to which the resolution before us refers, has occurred in the holy cause of the extinction of Slavery throughout the world.Mr. ROBERT KETTLE proposed the fourth resolution:'That, as the Press is one of the most efficient instruments in promoting the success of the Emancipation cause, these proceedings be published as widely as possible, under the direction of the Committee.'It is so much a matter of course that a public meeting give publicity to its proceedings, that I would conceive it unnecessary to say one word in support of my motion, were it not for the specialties of the case, and an intimation which I have been requested to append to it. It will be recollected by many present, that Mr. Thompson's challenge to discuss American Slavery, was accepted by his opponent when at Durham, through the medium of the London Patriot, and reported in many of the other papers. In fixing upon Glasgow as the place for holding the discussion, it was stated by Mr. Breckinridge that Mr. Thompson could have no objection to this, as it was the head quarters of his friends. This circumstance, and the confident manner in which Mr. B. embarked in the controversy, would doubtless leave upon the minds of many, an impression that his cause was surely a good one, and that a man of such high character, and such extensive knowledge of America, would not so far commit himself as to produce charges which he could not substantiate; and probably some of the less informed regarding the character of Mr. Thompson, and the principles he, in common with us, advocates, may be expecting to hear that we are ashamed of our Agent, and that we are completely cured of the folly of saying that America ought to do that which is right, and to do it immediately. We must endeavor to satisfy these good folks, be they in England, Ireland, or Scotland, that we are more attached than ever, (if it is possible to be so,) both to our old principles and to our able and eloquent Agent, who so faithfully, so prudently, so perseveringly, and so successfully maintained and propagated these principles in America. We can only do this through the public press, and the doing of it is attended with expense. Your acquiescing in my motion, therefore, leads me to call from each of you for a motion of your own. I am requested to inform you that there will be a collection on behalf of the Society on leaving the meeting. The motion you have to make is a very becoming one. The heart speaks to the hand, the hand makes an errand to the pocket, and communicates with the plate at the door, and in this way good people have an opportunity of doing good to a good cause. If any of you should be without money in your pocket, and wish to aid us, your subscription will be thankfully received by Mr. Beith, the Treasurer, Mr. Smeal, the Secretary; or by any member of the Committee.Dr. Heugh again rose. At the risk of its being thought that he spoke too often, he must lay something before them, to which he did not know well how to allude. It relates to our friend Mr. Thompson. He had never been adequately remunerated for his services. He had only got what barely sustained him and his family. A few friends to the emancipation cause having taken this into consideration, they resolved to present him, not with a piece of plate, but with a pecuniary testimonial. Though only a few had yet subscribed, the sum already amounted to between 200l and 300l. Their townsman, Dr. Cleland, had been presented with a testimonial of a substantial description; and though he did not wish to depreciate the Dr.'s services, he must say he considered that Mr. Thompson had wrought at least as well for such a mark of esteem. He would say no more; but if they would be so good as to turn it over in their kind hearts, and communicate the result to his friend Mr. Lethem, the Treasurer to the testimonial fund, he trusted something would be done to honor Mr. Thompson, which would, in fact, be also honoring themselves.Thanks were then voted to Dr. Heugh and the Managers, for the use of the Chapel, and to Mr. Grahame, for his conduct in the Chair. The venerable chairman was rapturously applauded by the audience. The meeting broke up about ten o'clock.                l l     

            THIS DAY PUBLISHED, the American Anti-Slavery Almanac for 1837, which contains the usual astronomical calculations and chronological tables used in Almanacs, which have been prepared with great care. There is also much interesting and useful information on the subject of slavery, which it is believed will do much to throw light upon the question of immediate abolition. Great care had been taken to gather all interesting events and occurrences, and no labor has been withheld in obtaining valuable articles from distinguished writers. The Almanac is also embellished with several appropriate engravings, &c.Among the articles are 'Free Discussion; Am. A.S. Society; $100,000 Reward; Emancipation in the West Indies; Principles of Anti-Slavery Societies; the Slave Father; Produce of Slave Labor; Children's Department; Temptation Resisted; a Mother's Anguish; Slave Population in the United States; Emigrants to Liberia; Objections Considered; Oneida Institute; Anti-Slavery Publications.Price 61-4 cents single, 50 cents a dozen, $3,-50 a hundred, $30 a thousand.All orders for the above work will be promptly answered.

            LONDON, Aug. 19, 1836.   To Rev. ELIZUR WRIGHT:My Dear Sir I have just time to inform you, that we had a most interesting and important public meeting last evening, to hear an address from our eloquent friend and fellow-laborer, George Thompson, on American Slavery. He might be said almost to have surpassed himself. It was a giant's effort, and was received by the numerous and enraptured audience with the heartiest demonstration of applause.At the close of the meeting, a series of resolutions were passed, (a copy of which I send you,) unanimously. They express the principles and feelings of the Abolitionists of this country; and be assured that henceforth there will be no silence here on a subject of all others the most interesting to you. These resolutions, I hope, will be widely circulated through the Union.Thompson did himself immortal honor, in his late discussion with the Rev. R.J. Breckinridge. For calm self-possession, for dignity of demeanor, for suavity of temper, and for christian courtesy, he could not be surpassed. In these points, he far exceeded his able and talented opponent. Pity 'its that a man of Breckinridge's standing in the christian church, and great capabilities both of language and argument, should waste his moral and intellectual strength in the support of a bad cause. Throughout the whole of the discussion, he merged the moralist and the divine in the special pleader. There was nothing generous about him nothing candid nothing that could win the heart. He was a most merciless opponent; but he was foiled, discomfited, beaten! Thompson's triumph was the triumph of truth over error. He pleaded in the name of outraged humanity, indignant justice, and insulted religion. The truths he uttered found an echo in the breast of his audience; and as you will perceive by the report of the last Glasgow meeting, his victory was complete. Mr. B. has now had an opportunity of meeting the Abolitionists of Scotland, and has found that they are to a man one with you in principle, in feeling, and in effort. Had he attended our meeting yesterday, he would have found the English Abolitionists not a whit behind their northern brethren. I regret he was not there; but there were Americans there, and among them, Professor Stowe of Lane Seminary.

       At a meeting held at Exeter Hall, on Thursday, the 18th August, 1836,RICHARD PEEK, Esq., late High Sheriff of the city of London and the county of Middlesex, in the Chair.After a powerful and eloquent address delivered by Geo. Thompson, Esq., on American Slavery, the following resolutions were unanimously passed:Moved by WM. KNIGHT, Esq.Seconded by Rev. EUSTACE CAREY.1. That this meeting have heard with deepest sorrow and indignation, of the enslavement, in the United States of America, of more than two millions of the population of that country; and of the prevalence of a domestic slave trade attended by circumstances of the most revolting cruelty; and that they regard such guilty practices, amongst a people otherwise free and exalted, as a flagrant violation of the principles set forth in their Declaration of Independence a shameless outrage on the spirit and precepts of the gospel and subversive in their tendency of the freedom, civilization and happiness of the human race.Moved by Rev. SAMUEL NICHOLSON.Seconded by Rev. THOMAS PRICE.2. That this meeting have learnt with great satisfaction of the American Anti-Slavery Society, and tender to its President, Officers and Members, the expression of their fraternal regards, and christian sympathies. That they contemplate with delight the rapid multiplication of effective auxiliaries, already amounting to six hundred, based upon the doctrine of the essential sinfulness of slavery, and the consequent duty of immediate and unconditional emancipation. And while they would encourage the Abolitionists of the United States to steadfast continuance, and increased exertion in their great work, they would offer them their cordial and zealous co-operation.Moved by J.B. LAW, Esq.Seconded by WM. ALEXANDER, Esq.3. That this meeting hail with delight the safe return of their distinguished countryman to his native land, and respectfully offer him their warm and grateful acknowledgments for his philanthropic and self-denying labors in the United States of America, in behalf of their suffering and oppressed fellow men.(Carried by acclamation, the meeting standing up.)Moved by GEORGE THOMPSON, Esq.Seconded by Rev. CHARLES STOVEL.4. That the thanks of this meeting be given to Richard Peek, Esq., for his kindness in taking the Chair on the present occasion.                                   

                   Go forth, at glorious morning's dawn,When birds their notes of gladness raise;When flowers, o'er verdant field and lawn,Breathe fragrantly their Maker's praise;Go, pour the fervent prayer to saveThe wretched, gloomy, fettered slave.Go thou, at noon-tide's sunny hour,And seek retirement's sweetest spot;Whether in Beauty's favorite bower,Or Nature's calm, sequestered grot;Go, and in faith, breathe thou the prayerFor those who groan in deep despair.Go when the sun is sinking lowBehind green trees and verdant hills;Then in thy Maker's presence bow,While sacred love the bosom fills:Pray that our God may speed the timeFor Freedom's reign, in every clime.When the still evening shadows come,And silence broods o'er all the earth,When thou art in thy tranquil home,And hushed is every sound of mirth;Raise thou; in hope and humble love,Prayer for the slave to God above!Pray thou, that mercy may be sentThat every band may broken be;Pray, that the tyrant may relentThat earth from slavery may be free!Pray thou to Heaven send there the cryThat tears be wiped from every eye.Then, blessings on thy head shall fall,Fair Freedom's light o'er earth will shineThe captive souls shall 'each and all,'Be guided by a hand divine;For surely, God will bow his ear,And stoop, the prayer of faith to hear!Milville.            faith      Then                 there        will  faith   Milville.

Soul of our fathers!Shrink we all craven-like, When the storm gathers?What though the tempest be Over us lowering,Where's the New Englander Shamefully cowering?Graves green and holy Around us are lying,Free were the sleepers all, Living and dying!Back with the Southerner's Padlocks and scourges:Go let him fetter down Ocean's free surges:Go let him silence Winds, clouds, and watersNever New England's own Free sons and daughters!Free as our rivers are Ocean-ward goingFree as the breezes are Over us blowing.Up to our altars, then, Haste we, and summonCourage and loveliness, Manhood and woman.Deep let our pledges be Freedom foreverTruce with Oppression, Never, oh! never!By our own birthright-gift, Granted of HeavenFreedom for heart and lip, Be the pledge given!If we have whispered Truth, Whisper no longer:Speak as the tempest does, Sterner and stronger:Still be the tones of truth Louder and firmer,Startling the haughty South With the deep murmur:'God and our Charter's right, Freedom foreverTruce with Oppression, Never, oh! never!                                                      

       We have been favored with the perusal of a letter from a gentleman in Cincinnati to his friend in this vicinity. It was not probably intended for publication, yet as it contained no injunction of secrecy, we are permitted to extract the following. Other portions, it is thought advisable to omit, for the present. Suffice it to say, that God it stripping off disguises from false professors and ungodly ministers with a rapidity so startling and instructive, that we feel under no temptation to blazon abroad their nakedness any faster than Divine Providence is doing it by their own hands, and in a way which spares us the unpleasant task of standing up us their accusers. But to our extract. Friend of Man.  Friend of Man    CINCINNATI, August 17, 1836.   'You have no doubt heard of the riots in this city. It has at length turned out as I supposed it would, having anticipated tremendous opposition in this city. Some had supposed that the crisis was past here, that the press had been so long time established that none would now think of tearing it down. I told them that it would be a perfect anomaly in Anti-Slavery history, if the opposition in this city was not more fierce, more bitter and unrelenting, than in any other place without the northern boundary of the slave states. Look at its locality, standing right on the border ground of the slaveholding dominions its inhabitants many of them wealthy slave-owners, and many more those who have made fortunes from the blood, and bones, and sinews of the slave, and retired to this place to spend the remainder of their days in squandering the wealth that is steeped in human tears its great commercial highway (the Ohio river) running right into the capital of this kingdom of iniquity, with the prospects also of having its importance quadrupled by a connection with the South through a stupendous rail way; add to this the fact that there is not a city of the same size in the Union that can furnish such a set of money gourmands as this; looking at all these things, I wondered that the smothered fires had not burst out long before this. But the storm came at length with tremendous power. I believe for cool, deliberate determination to put down the freedom of the press, no mob has surpassed the one in Cincinnati. The whole plan was concocted and carried into effect by 'gentlemen of property and standing.' Look at the committee. Burnet, Walker (of the Unitarian church,) Groesbeck (an Elder of Dr. Beecher's church,) Josiah Lawrence, of the Methodist church, professedly 'perfect,' having committed no sin for some years, Nick Longworth, (the Girard of the city ----- -----,) Morgan Neville (-----) et id omne genus. The association for putting down the Philanthropist, I am told, was organized some months ago, and has been gaining strength ever since. The initiation fee was large, some pledged, I am informed, as high as fifty dollars for the destruction of the press. From the aristocracy, the disaffection worked down through the lower classes into the coffee houses, (grog shops) thence into the sewers.* Dr. F ----- (member of Dr. Beecher's church) was one of our most violent opposers. He declared publicly that he would head a mob, to destroy the press, and tar and feather Mr. Birney.** Charles Hammond has been winning laurels for himself. He has taken a noble stand. Shortly after the riot, he came out and charged the mob upon the Market house Committee,*** and said they were responsible for all the damages. This awakened the ire of the dignissimi, and they began to stop their papers, but ten new subscribers were gained where one was lost. Things have now settled into a quiet state, but I presume the business is not yet ended. The Philanthropist will be out in a week or two, with the details of the whole affair, flaring the sins of the aristocrats in their faces. We are not yet slaves, and shall not obey the commands of the veteran Cincinnati mobocrats, until they can prove their right to us, as property. They will find it is not the way to loosen a man's attachment to his opinions, to pursue him with blood hounds. The great object now among the 'gentlemen of property and standing' is to get hold of Mr. Birney. I presume, could they get him into Kentucky, he would never repass the Ohio River. The gentlemen make no secret of their designs to murder him. Perhaps they do not say this in so many words; but such intimations are thrown out, as plainly indicate what would be done, were he so unfortunate as to fall into their hands. But I can give you only a faint idea of the state of things here. This will be the rallying point of opposition. When mobs, and murders, and the destruction of presses cease in Cincinnati, you may conclude that the day star from on high has arisen; that the waves of commotion are all hushed to rest, and that the ark of emancipation, universal and eternal, is safely moored in the haven of freedom.'  gentlemen of property and standing. et id omne genus.       * Dr. F ----- is a respectable practising physician, whose father is a Kentucky slaveholder.** Charles Hammond is the aged and able editor of the Cincinnati Daily Gazette, and a reputed infidel. (Let no one stumble at this. The Saviour told the Scribes and Pharisees that even publicans and harlots should go into the kingdom of heaven before them. The skeptical Saducees were far less virulent and hypocritical. ED.)*** When public meetings in Cincinnati are too large to be accommodated in the Court House, they generally do business in the Market House.        

       Hence, Belmour, perfidious! this moment retire; No further entreaties employ;Nor meanly pretend any more to admire What basely you wish to destroy!Say, youth, shall I madly rush on upon shame, If a traitor but artfully sighs?And eternally part with my honor and fame, For a compliment paid to my eyes?If a flame, all dishonest, be vilely professed, Through tenderness shall I recline;And seek to indulge the repose of a breast, That would plant endless tortures in mine?Can the wretch who suspects, nay, who wishes me base, Expect that I e'er should be kind?Or alone, with a paltry address to my face, For the injuries done to my mind?No, villain! a passion I can't but despise, Shall never find way to my ears;Nor the man meet a glance of regard from those eyes, Who would drench them forever in tears.Hence, Belmour, this instant! and cease every dream Which your hope saw so foolishly born;Nor vainly imagine to gain my esteem, By deserving my hate and my scorn.               tortures in mine?      mind?      tears.      hate scorn.

            The semi-annual meeting of this society was held at Danvers on the 15th inst. at the meeting house of Rev. Milton P. Braman. It was called to order by the President at 10 o'clock A.M. C.C. BURLEIGH, agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society, offered the first Resolution, asserting that the discussion of the subject of Slavery is a duty which we owe to God, to the oppressed, and ourselves.This resolution was sustained by the mover, Rev. D.T. Kimball of Ipswich and J. Blanchard of Andover.On motion of Rev. David T. Kimball of Ipswich, it was Resolved, That love of our country requires that we seek the speedy termination of slavery.Mr. Kimball sustained his resolution in a pertinent speech. Mr. Blanchard followed, pointing out the dangers which had attended slavery in the nations of the old world. He concluded with a highly wrought and affecting description of the utter desolation which had fallen upon Judea, once the garden of the Lord, in consequence of pride and oppression. Mr. Burleigh rose and stated that it was not necessary to look abroad or to go back to ancient times for examples most appalling of the dangerous and baneful influence of slavery. 'Look,' said he, 'at Eastern Virginia, fertile as a Paradise when first the plough of the settler broke its virgin soil. How was it now? Blighted and blasted and stricken with barrenness desolate as if seared by the avenging hand of Heaven! whole parishes depopulated the very wolf returning to his haunts of other centuries, and howling over the desolate hearth stone! Why but a short time ago, we were told that an ancient Church, an Episcopal House of Worship had been discovered in the woods of Virginia, which had been forgotten, and whose origin and history were unknown to the few inhabitants of the desolate vicinity! Slavery had there done its perfect work of evil: where the thronging worshippers once gathered; where the voice of praise and thanksgiving went upward fearfully mingled with the clank of the captive's chain; altar, aisle and arch were draped and tasseled by the weaving spider, the owl and the bittern flapped their obscene wings around it and the very memory of this sanctuary of Jehovah had been lost! Mr. B. spoke at length in an eloquent and forcible manner. He was followed in some brief remarks by Wm. B. Dodge of Salem and A. Sanger of Danvers.On motion of J. Blanchard of Andover, it was Resolved, 'That the doctrines of Emancipation are neither modern nor novel ones, having been held and advocated by the ablest divines, statesmen and philosophers, in this country and Europe.'On motion of S.H. EMERY, Secretary of the Andover Anti-Slavery Society, it was Resolved, 'That the sentiment that ministers of the Gospel and candidates for the ministry have nothing to do with slavery is false and deceptive, and ought immediately to be abandoned.'On motion of C.C. Burleigh it was Resolved, 'That, relying as we do, in a great degree, upon the circulation of Anti-Slavery publications, for the promotion of the cause of Emancipation, we cordially commend the Boston Liberator to the citizens of Essex county, as an independent, but consistent and valuable advocate of that cause.'Several gentlemen spoke upon this resolution. It was stated as a reason why the Liberator should be mentioned in a special manner, that the New York publications were circulated by the American Anti-Slavery Society, and were its organs, whereas the Liberator was an independent paper, and of course no society was pledged to support it. Some objections being raised in regard to the Editor's opinions on certain subjects unconnected with his advocacy of Emancipation, an animated discussion arose, which resulted in an entirely unanimous vote in favor of the resolution, recommending the paper solely on the ground of its efficient and praise-worthy advocacy of the cause of Emancipation and Justice.On motion of C.C. Burleigh, the following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That the circulation of memorials praying for the Abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia is a duty incumbent upon every friend of Liberty, especially at this moment when the GREAT RIGHT OF PETITION IS IN DANGER, and the people of the South are told by their own statesmen, that it is already practically annihilated.'A vote of thanks to the society who had offered their house for the meeting, and to the citizens of Danvers for their hospitality to the delegates, was passed; and the meeting adjourned at about 9 o'clock in the evening.       Resolved           unconnected with his advocacy of Emancipation entirely unanimous     Resolved      G.B. PERRY, Pres.   JOHN G. WHITTIER, Sec.    

         Soon shall the trump of freedom Resound from shore to shore;Soon, taught by heavenly wisdom, Man shall oppress no more:But every yoke be broken, Each captive soul act freeAnd every heart shall welcome The day of Jubilee.The tyrants' crown and sceptres, And victors' wreaths and cars,And galling chains, and fetters, With all the pomp of wars,Shall in the dust be trodden, Till time shall be no more:And peace, and joy, from heaven The Lord on earth shall pour.                    

       Among all the clerical opponents of the anti-slavery cause in this country, scarcely any one has betrayed so much bitter hostility, or dealt in such odious charges against the abolitionists, as Wilbur Fisk. Up to the last moment of his departure for England, he was incessant in his efforts to extinguish the kindling flame of philanthropy in the bosoms of the people; and warned his Methodist brethren, in particular, not even to join in petitioning Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia! Much curiosity has been excited to know how he would be received in England, and what language he would use in relation to the subject of slavery. At a meeting of the Wesleyan Conference at Birmingham, in July, he was called upon to give an account of the progress of the cause in America, when (according to the London Christian Advocate of Aug. 1,) 'he declared his abhorrence of slavery, and represented himself as being A DECIDED ABOLITIONIST'!!! 'In his opinion, slavery was evil only evil AND THAT CONTINUALLY'!! What monstrous tergiversation, and glaring contradiction! The following is an extract from his speech, the falsehood of which is equalled only by its effrontery:'Another cause of deterioration in America is our agitation on the subject of SLAVERY. Perhaps it may be proper for me to say a word on this subject in relation to myself. My name got to Birmingham before me. A circular has been distributed representing me as an abettor of slavery and as a slave-holder. If the gentleman who is the author of that document had read his Bible more, and meddled with the affairs of other people less, he would have learned not to bear false witness against his neighbor. I have been educated in a different school one of abhorrence of slavery; and, never having lived in the slaveholding states, I had scarcely seen more than five or six colored persons until I grew up to manhood; and all I have seen, in travelling in slaveholding states, since that time, has tended to strengthen and confirm my early impressions. In my opinion, slavery is evil, only evil, and that continually. The intimations of that circular are wholly unfounded. I do not believe that any such party as a pro-slavery party exists in the Methodist Episcopal Church in America. Some differences of opinion exist as to the best means of getting rid of slavery; and whether I, or those who think with me, have formed a right opinion on that subject, may be a debatable matter. On both sides, a difference of opinion exists as to the getting rid of this evil; and it is to be lamented, that this difference of opinion is greatly retarding or injuring the general work. In the practical difficulties we have to contend with on this subject, no man can sympathize, who has not has personally to deal with them. We need you pity, not your censure; if we deserve censure we have it plentifully from other quarters; be censure and vituperation are not likely to bring about the consummation we all desire. By the original constitution of the United States, the Congress have no more power to deal with the question, than the Parliament of Great Britain, neither have the non-slaveholding states. You know the excitement which existed between North and South on the Tariff question; just that was healed, the other agitation commenced and political men have said, that this is another instance of interference with the Southern States. The progress of emancipation gradually advances. Several States have emancipated six slaves; two or three were, as I believe, on the eve of adopting some efficient measures in reference to the abolition of slavery; many think that in point of interest even, such a measure is prudent; this impression, and other consideration will tend to work emancipation, slowly it may but surely. The attempt to propel the [ ] has produced great present resistance. The day will come, we trust, when we shall join with you in the triumphs of emancipation: but those who have so lately freed themselves of the [ ] which was not so interwoven with the state and society here as in America, ought not to censure us so severely, or indulge in accusations which only chafe and irritate. I am glad to be permitted to speak thus freely. My personal reception has been different from what I expected. I have not met with a rod or a club at every turn; in spite of out-door influence, you have waited for explanation, and you have treated me like a brother. For the purpose of relieving the mind of my brother, I will read from our book of discipline the rule on this subject. I wish to go to official documents. I am asked why our Conference have not passed a resolution opposed to slavery. I answer, that the standard doings of the Conference are such as not to require any new declaration on this subject. If any body of men have meliorated and softened the state of slavery, done any thing to prepare the way for emancipation, it is the Methodist body. (Here Dr. F. read the following Questions and Answers from the Second Part of the Book of Doctrines and Discipline of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Section 10.)OF SLAVERY. Quest. What shall be done for the extirpation of the evil of slavery?Ans. 1. We declare that we are as much as ever convinced of the great evil of slavery; therefore no slaveholder shall be eligible to any official station in our church hereafter, where the laws of the State in which he lives will admit of emancipation, and permit the liberated slave to enjoy freedom.2. When any travelling preacher becomes an owner of a slave or slaves, by any means, he shall forfeit his ministerial character in our church, unless he execute, if it be practicable, a legal emancipation of such slaves, conformably to the laws of the State in which he lives.3. All our preachers shall prudently enforce upon our members the necessity of teaching their slaves to read the word of God; and to allow them time to attend upon the public worship of God, on our regular days of divine service.4. Our colored preachers and official members shall have all the privileges which are usual to others in the district and quarterly conferences, where the usages of the country do not forbid it. And the presiding elder may hold for them a separate district conference, where the number of local preachers will justify it.Our general rules, I have said, are the same as yours. Only one condition is required of the members of our Society, a desire to flee from the wrath to come; but that desire is to be evinced by the observance of certain practices, and the forsaking of others. The buying and selling of men, women, and children, with intent to enslave them, is one of the forbidden practices.  No Conference has the power to alter our essential laws, but the General Conference, (held every four years,) and that only when three-fourths of the Annual Conferences have first recommended the change.'  he declared his abhorrence of slavery, and represented himself as being    slavery is evil, only evil, and that continually interest             buying and selling of men, women, and children, with intent to enslave them, is one of the forbidden practices.    

         The following articles, the first a communication, and the second editorial, we cut from the Jamaica Watchman, for the purpose of showing what people abroad, and even in the West Indies, till recently the very strong hold of slavery, think of us boasting republicans, and how they estimate our pretensions to liberality of feeling, and love of equal rights. Of course we do not hold ourselves responsible for the sentiments expressed. Every one can judge for himself as to their correctness or incorrectness.     B.   We are happy to perceive that the Americans in this island are ashamed of the conduct of their countrymen at home. Two of them (or perchance one writing under different signatures,) have been figuring in the columns of the Despatch and Chronicle. They might have done so without any notice from us, but for their assertion, that the letter of 'Jamaican' was written in this island, or by the tried and unflinching friend of the oppressed, Mr. Garrison, of the Liberator.We cannot undertake to say the letter was not written by Mr. Garrison, although we do not think it was. It appears to us extremely improbable that that gentleman would occupy his time in writing communications for a Jamaica newspaper when he had his own to attend to. But written by whom it was, it was written in New York, and not Kingston. As far as we can judge, it is the production of some colored person who has been silly enough to leave his native country (Jamaica or one of the Windward Islands,) for the boasted land of freedom, and who has been taught to his cost, that although professedly so, still in reality, as far as colored persons are concerned, it is the very focus of tyranny, prejudice, and injustice. It is not all gold that glitters, and our correspondent has experienced that little confidence is to be placed in the vainglorious boastings and lip-deep professions of liberty and equality put forth by the degenerate descendants of Britons. Their liberty and equality are intended only for such as wear a fair skin. They have none to spare even for their own offspring, if, perchance, he has African blood in his veins.It is worthy of remark that the writer in the Chronicle as well as the Despatch, attributes the letter we published to Mr. Garrison. One would be led to infer from this circumstance, that they considered no one in New York willing or able to write such a letter. If this be their opinion, they can know very little indeed of the colored persons in that city, or the extent of their acquirements. Indeed, this very ignorance is evidence of the correctness of our correspondent's statements, and we cannot help thinking, that a consciousness of the truth of the charges brought against the Americans, led the parties in question to endeavor to nullify the effect the communication in question is calculated to produce, and will produce, not only among the colored inhabitants of this island, but also among those of the other class who have risen superior to such narrow and unchristian views and feelings.An American (and he first appeared) denies only one of the statements of our correspondent, that 'a free man even here in non-slaveholding States is liable to be kidnapped and carried to the South, and sold.' The inference then is, that the others are correct. We might have been disposed to think with this writer that kidnapping would not be tolerated, although we have no right to doubt the correctness of our correspondent's statement, seeing that a native of America who leaves the place of his birth for a time, and subsequently returns to it, is liable to be taken and sold as a slave. If such a gross violation of the rights of free men is tolerated, nay, sanctioned by law, surely we have no right to disbelieve the assertion, that a free man may be kidnapped, carried to the South and sold. But, says an American, where are the colonization and emancipation Societies? Of the latter, we know nothing. From the tender mercies of the former, every colored man may pray to be delivered. We had thought the exposure made by Mr. Garrison of that Society in England, would have prevented its being again named in any place where correct notions of what is just and proper are entertained. It, no doubt, is an excellent society according to the American notions of excellence, but we can tell an American, if he does not know it, it is a stink in the nostril of every British philanthropist. The Colonization Society, a protection for colored men from being kidnapped, taken to the South and sold! We guess an American will labor long and hard before he gets us or any one else who knows anything of that Society, to believe such pure unmixed nonsense. As a matter of course, the American denounces the browns in America as limited in number, and together with the blacks extremely ignorant. It would have been extremely surprising had he failed to do this, and nothing we suspect but regard for public opinion, has prevented him from saying a great deal more with just about as much truth.With the Serpent's guile this liberty and equality man essays to make it appear, that our correspondent complained that the Americans did not make a difference between the browns and blacks. He did nothing of the kind, as a perusal of his letter will shew. The trick is old, and has been so often repeated, that it fails to produce the desired effect. The other American sneers at what he is pleased to term the small circulation of this paper. This is an error into which he and others like him pretend to fall. There is no paper more greedily, but stealthily sought after, and carefully read, than ours, and as the circulation affects no one but ourselves, we can tell C.D.P. it is quite sufficient for all good purposes, and quite satisfactory. This champion says, 'they (the colored persons) have churches of their own supported by themselves; their Officers, from the Parson down, are all chosen by, and FROM themselves.' Now, we would just like this liberal American, this advocate for liberty and equality, to tell us why it is that the colored persons have separate Religious Establishments, and even preachers from among themselves. Has this been the result of chance or choice, or have they been driven to it by the prejudices of the other class a prejudice reaching into the very House, and to the very Altar of the God they profess to worship, and who, if there be truth in Scripture, made of one flesh all the nations of the earth. The very fact adduced by C.D.P. is a damning proof of the extent of the illiberality and prejudice of which our correspondent complained. C.D.P. says, he is proud to own he is an American. Perhaps he is. Some men are lost to all sense of shame, and are proud even of a dishonorable action! Is not this American in this condition? We think he ought to blush for his country, and for men who, with a lie in their right hands, are continually vaunting their independence, and their miscalled liberty and equality.And after all, what is the sum and substance of these American defences? Sorry ones, certainly. One of the writers denies that free men can be kidnapped, and taken to the South and sold the other says, in effect, the colored population of the free States, of free America, have no cause of complaint, because, forsooth, they are ignorant, and have their own places of worship, which they support themselves, and their own parsons. Verily, if the land of liberty can produce no abler or better defenders than the two we have alluded to, it must be badly off indeed. These miserable attempts at justification, more than any thing else, prove the truth and correctness of the statements contained in the letter which elicited them; and how deeply indebted our class is to the British people, and how devotedly attached it ought even to remain to the British Crown. Talk about liberty. Let the vaunting sons of America look to Britain, and copy from her some of those noble and generous feelings which render her the pride and generous feelings which render her the pride and glory of the earth, and admit that their liberty is like the sounding brass and the tinkling cymbal. A mere empty and heartless profession.      nullify   guess   supported by themselves   free free

The wound was dangerous, though he appears to be recovering.One of the mob-leaders was an Engineer on board of the steamboat Motto.  He was dressed in a style somewhat remarkable, and during the work was known by the name of Santa Anna. A person engaged in the same boat, probably as assistant Engineer, was also a mob-leader.

 To the Editor of the Watchman:SIR, Through a laudable desire of giving information to my countrymen, I pen these lines concerning the treatment of colored people in this boasting, tyrannical, and hypocritical land a land boasting of its free institutions, yet countenancing and defending an oppression unequalled in the darkest and cruelist ages of antiquity of the equality of all men, yet most shamefully trampling upon the rights, civil, moral, and spiritual, of the black and colored race. I declare, upon the word of a Christian man, and from my own experimental knowledge, that there is not another nation under the sun, in which the colored race suffer such persecution, contumeliousness, and degradation. I have been amongst the Spaniards, who are accounted the most ruthless, and I never saw a thousandth part so much amongst them. A free man here in the Northern non-slaveholding States, is liable every day to be kidnapped and carried South and sold, and even here every obstacle is thrown in his way every door is closed against him; he cannot give even a verdict as a juror, in a court of justice; nay, so far is this abominable spirit carried, that many will not even deal with him in a commercial way. The lowest, the vilest, the most ignorant, and the most contemptible, point at him the finger of scorn. One thing more I would deeply impress upon you is this they make no distinction between a black man, and what we call colored. They call them both negroes (and negro with them is a term more contemptible than dog.) It matters not how fair you are, how much European preponderance you have, so you possess the least tincture of African blood. Moreover, they call the black man a colored man, and vice versa, the colored man a black, or negro. Now, I do not say this for disparagement of the black man, or through prejudice to him; far be it from me, but that I may warn others of the rock upon which I have split. The mariner just from his voyage, speaks of rocks and sand banks, storms and tempests the raging ocean, the howling tornado, and the hurricane's blast.America will certainly fall under the Divine displeasure for her cruelties; nay, already the viols of wrath are being poured out upon her. We see it in the daily cries of fire in the wild warwhoop of the savage Indians, who are now deluging the domestic floor with blood and death. We see it in mobs, in disorder, confusion, and universal panic, and if they don't acquiesce speedily in the commands of Heaven, and let the oppressed go free, we shall soon hear the trump of retribution resounding from Niagara's dashing falls to Mississippi's wide expanded mouth. My design in writing you is threefold: First, that I might put every colored man in Jamaica in full information of the low state in which his class is held here. 2dly that I might inspire them with more burning loyalty to our beloved government; and thirdly, that I might apprize those who should be desirous to come here of the crosses which await them, and so I beg you will give wide circulation to this communication.

 The Troy Mobocrats. A friend informs us, that 13 of those who were engaged in mobbing the Abolitionists, have been indicted as rioters. At the head of the list stands KELSEY HAZEN, a dry goods merchant of the city. Some of the rioters have obtained bail, and some of them are in prison because they cannot get it. It is said that they have applied for bail to some of those who instigated them, but in vain; and that they think it rather hard to do their dirty work for them, and then have to lie in prison for it, for want of bail. Ib.

       The editor of the New York Sun, of the 22nd, quotes the following extract from General Houston's letter to General Dunlap, of Nashville, 'for a portion of this force we must look to the U. States.  It cannot reach us too soon. There is but one feeling in Texas, in my opinion, and that is to establish the independence of Texas, and to beattached to the United States' and then remarks:Here, then, is an open avowal by the commander-in-chief of the Texian army, that American troops will be required to seize and sever this province of the Mexican republic, for the purpose of uniting it to ours; and this avowal is made by a distinguished American citizen, in the very face of that glorious constitution of his country, which wisely gives no power to its citizens for acquiring foreign territory by conquest, their own territory being more than amply sufficient to gratify any safe ambition; and in the face, too, of the following solemn and sacred contract of his country with the sister republic which he would dismember:'There shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace, and a true and sincere friendship between the United States of America, and the United Mexican States, in all the extent of their possessions and territories, between their people and citizens respectively, without distinction of persons or places.'In the earlier days of our republic, when a high-minded and honorable fidelity to its constitution was an object proudly paramount to every mercenary consideration that might contravene it, an avowed design of this kind against the possessions of a nation with whom the United States were at peace, would have subjected its author, if a citizen, to the charge of high treason, and to its consequences. When Aaron Burr and his associates were supposed to meditate the conquest of Mexico, and attempted to raise troops in the southern states to achieve it, they were arrested for treason, and Burr, their chief, was tried for his life. But now, behold! the conquest of a part of the same country is an object openly proclaimed, not in the letters of General Houston alone, but by many of our wealthiest citizens at public banquets, and by the hireling presses in the chief cities of our Union. The annexation of a foreign territory to our own by foreign conquest, being thus unblushingly avowed, and our citizens who are integral portions of our national sovereignty being openly invited and incited to join the crusade with weapons of war, it becomes an interesting moral inquiry what is there on the public mind to excuse or even to palliate so flagrant a prostitution of national faith and honor in these days, any more than in the days that are past? The answer is ready at hand, and is irrefutable. An extensive and well organized gang of swindlers in Texas lands, have raised the cry, and the standard of 'Liberty!' and to the thrilling charm of this glorious word, which stirs the blood of a free people, as the blast of the bugle arouses every nerve of the war-horse, have the generous feelings of our citizens responded in ardent delusion. But, as the Commercial Advertiser truly declares, 'Never was the Goddess of American Liberty invoked more unrighteously;' and we cannot but believe that the natural sagacity, good sense, and proud regard for their national honor, for which our citizens are distinguished in the eyes of all nations, will speedily rescue them from the otherwise degrading error in which that vile crew of mercenary, hypocritical swindlers would involve them. The artful deceivers, however, have not relied upon the generosity and noble sympathy only of our fellow citizens, for they insidiously presented a bribe to excite their cupidity also. They have not only falsely represented the Texian cause as one of pure, disinterested liberty and justice, as opposed to perfidious tyranny and cruel oppression, but they have themselves assumed something more than the liberty which they basely and hypocritically advocate, by impudently promising a fertile paradisaical piece of Texian land, a mile square, to every American citizen and foreign emigrant, who will sally forth to capture it from the Mexican republic! Induced by one or both of these objects, many hundreds of our enterprising citizens left their own sample and unobjectionable country, to unite with Irish, English, and other foreign adventurers in a war, from the fullest success of which, only some six or eight Land Companies, who have fraudulently and audaciously monopolized the Texian territory, would gain an important benefit. And to this shrine of Mammon, concealed by the crowding banners of ostensible liberty, have many hundreds of our gallant youth been treacherously sacrificed sacrificed by a mercenary treachery, compared to which that exercised by Santa Anna, in defence of the Republic of which he was President, was innocence and patriotism.Had we in the Texians, a brave and injured people, struggling in the land of their birth, or even of their adoption, for those abstract and social rights of mankind which were the objects of our revolution, and which we obtained and enjoy, theirs would be a cause with which angels might sympathize, and which the bolts of heaven might well be launched to aid. But is it such a cause? Deceived by misrepresentations, we were ourselves led so to consider it, in its earlier efforts; but a fair examination of facts has undeceived us, and we look in vain either for such a cause or such a people in the Texians. What are the facts?We pledge ourselves to answer this question with a perspicuity which shall defy all future obscuration, and with a rigid adherence to truth which shall defy the most desperate efforts to refute. We have, at present, only room to state, in brief, that the Texian revolution was concerted by the planters and slave speculators in the southern states ever since the first permission given by the Spanish authorities to Moses Austin, of Missouri, in the year 1820, to introduce 300 families, professing the Catholic religion, as colonists of a grant of land which he obtained upon this express condition. From that time to the present moment the aggressions have been on the part of the colonists, under the sanction of the southern speculators; and not until their purpose of getting a physical force into the province which should detach it from Mexico, and make it a slaveholding state, became flagrant and undisguised, had the settlers, ever received aught but protection, encouragement, toleration and kindness, from the Mexican government. They paid no taxes, had their own laws and tribunals, were allowed to profess and exercise all the religions they chose, though contrary to the Mexican constitution; enjoyed all the fruits of a beautiful and bounteous soil without return or tribute to the government to which it belonged, and were, without exception, the freest civilized people upon the face of the earth. But the object of the colonizing land agents of the South was to make this prolific province their own, and the field of a new and lucrative negro slavery. To this they still tenaciously adhere; and if they can induce a strong force of our American youth to shed their blood for the unjust and avaricious cause of slavery, under the name of Texian liberty and independence, they will undoubtedly secure their object. We doubt not the ability of our gallant countrymen to exterminate any number of Mexicans that can be brought against them, but in fighting for the union of Texas with the United States, which is the avowed meaning of 'Texian Independence,' they will be fighting for that which, at no distant period, will inevitably DISSOLVE THE UNION. The slave states having this eligible addition to their land of bondage, with its harbors, bays, and well-bounded geographical position, will are long cut asunder the federal tie, which they have long held with ungracious and unfraternal fingers, and confederate a new and distinct slaveholding republic, in opposition to the whole free republic of the North. Thus early will be fulfilled the prediction of the old politicians of Europe, that our Union could not remain one century entire; and then also will the maxim be exemplified in our history, as it is in the history of the slaveholding republics of old, that liberty and slavery cannot long inhabit the same soil. If this be true, then the sooner Texas becomes the wedge which shall divide the Union, the better for the cause of liberty. Already are the sacred rights of free public discussion, and of a free press, prostrated in the northern states to the influence of the southern; and either the latter must give up their slaves, or we must be added to the number. The annexation of Texas may save us from this; but it is upon this ulterior effect, and this only, that we can admit the cause of Texas to be the cause of liberty.  for a portion of this force we must look to the U. States.  and to be attached to the United States       a mile square   our we     

 MR. GARRISON has lashed with caustic severity the editors of the Vermont Chronicle, Boston Recorder, New Hampshire Observer, and Christian Mirror, for their meanness and hypocrisy not only in crushing the slave and upholding the master indirectly; but seizing on every opportunity of attacking, directly and indirectly, the Liberator and himself; and especially, by invoking the prejudices of sectarianism against him for incidentally noticing the day of the Christian Sabbath, in which he differs in opinion from most christians. This opinion, though incidental, we were sorry to see introduced by Mr. G. not because we hold, in common with the christian community, sentiments entirely different, but because he is engaged successfully in a great and difficult enterprise, which has no connexion with this which requires all Mr. G's time and talents, and which would be likely to suffer by such a diversion. We foresaw that the enemy of freedom and righteousness would seize upon this circumstance to prove that Mr. G. was a fanatic, unworthy of public confidence; and, knowing as we do the sordid mind of the editor of the Vermont Chronicle, we are not surprised to find him invoking the passions and prejudices of a sectarian spirit against the Liberator and the Abolitionists. But Mr. Garrison has answered these cavillers with great spirit and force, and we wish that anti-slavery readers, who have not seen the leading editorial article in the Liberator of Sept. 10, would procure that paper, and read that article. Lynn Record.   indirectly attacking, himself; Lynn Record.   

       We suspend our remarks on this subject for this week. In the meantime a correspondent desires some friend of the A.S. Society in Philadelphia to inform us, if he knows, whether a certain physician of that city, who is a Vice-President of the Pennsylvania Young Men's Colonization Society, did not, during the past winter, sell eighty thousand dollars worth of lands and human beings in a slave state; and whether the said physician was not, about the same time, elected an elder in a Presbyterian church, into which office he was not ordained, on account of the opposition made by the church, arising from the transaction above alluded to, which opposition resulted in the physician's leaving the church. Emancipator.(We can satisfy the enquirer. Alexander Mitchel, M.D. of this city, one of the Vice Presidents of the Young Men's Colonization Society, was the owner (?) of a large number of slaves, in Alabama we think. Last winter when at the south he sold them for a very large amount, whether it was for $80,000, we cannot say. This however does not alter the fact in question. While absent, he with two other gentlemen were elected elders in the church (Mr. Winchester's) to which he belonged; the others by an unanimous vote, and he by a majority. On returning, having understood that some persons voted against him, while others refused to vote at all on the ground of his being a slaveholder he left the church. As we worshipped at the same church, we heard much about it at the time and believe that these statements are strictly correct. If we have mis-stated any thing we shall be happy to rectify it. Philad. Times.  Emancipator.   Philad. Times.   

                 After a protracted sojourn in Connecticut, the editor is once more located in Boston; consequently, letters may no longer be addressed to him at Brooklyn, Ct. He is indebted to his able friend Mr. C.C. Burleigh, for many articles of interest communicated and published during his absence. For several months past, his health has failed him, but he is now better. Of course, sickness and absence have prevented him from giving that care and attention to the paper which it needed, and which he shall now endeavor to bestow upon it. Some articles have been inserted which he should have omitted, had they been submitted to his inspection; and very many others have been excluded which would have appeared, had he been present to prepare them. His thanks are due both to the publisher and the patrons of the Liberator, for allowing him to be absent so long, with so little of complaint, although they have desired his presence continually in the city.A large mass of communications has accumulated upon his hands, which, among such mountainous piles of anti-slavery matter as are thrown up weekly in all parts of the land, it will be difficult to reduce, so narrow are the limits of his paper. It is hoped correspondents will not be offended, nor suppose that their favors are not duly appreciated, if they should not obtain so speedy a hearing as is desirable. What can be done shall be done to meet their expectations more cannot be promised, more they will not ask.

       An edition of 1250 copies of the Discussion at Glasgow between George Thompson and Robert J. Breckinridge, has already been disposed of, except a few copies for retail at the Anti-Slavery Office; and several orders remain unsupplied. A second edition will therefore be put to press immediately, accompanied by copious notes and animadversions from the pen of Mr. Garrison: but the price will not be enhanced. The account of the public meeting at Glasgow, in reference to this notable discussion, which occupies so large a portion of our paper to-day, will be inserted in an Appendix. Our friends are requested to send in their orders as promptly as possible, (and it is hoped that they will be large, for the cause of emancipation cannot be aided more effectually than by the circulation of this pamphlet,) that we may be able to determine somewhat accurately upon the number of copies we may be safely authorized to print.    

 Mr. Henry, Smith Cashier of the Gloucester bank, committed suicide on Monday morning about 7 o'clock, by cutting his throat. He rose from his bed and went to the barn, where he committed the fatal deed. No cause assigned for this rash act.     

       The death of this long-tried, untiring and zealous friend of the colored race is, humanly speaking, one of the greatest afflictions which have yet befallen the anti-slavery cause. He was one of the few individuals, who, at the commencement of my labors as an abolitionist, bade me God-speed, and proffered the hospitality of his delightful home. At first, as an abolitionist of the old school, he hesitated awhile before be heartily embraced the principles and measures of the new; but when the National Anti-Slavery Convention assembled in Philadelphia, he enrolled his name as a member, took an active part in its deliberations, and up to the hour of his last illness, was a manager of the American Society, and constant in his attendance at all its annual meetings. But, for the space of-thirty years, he signalized himself in an especial manner, by espousing the cause of such persons as were seized and claimed as runaway slaves; and by his benevolent and prompt interference, hundreds of captives were set free, and the designs of the slave-catchers frustrated. On all occasions of distress, or whenever they needed aid or advice in an emergency, the colored people of Philadelphia always resorted to him as their most devoted friend and benefactor and they never applied in vain. The language of Job is peculiarly applicable to this worthy individual for with the man of Uz he might say, 'When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was a robe and a diadem. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. I was a father to the poor; and the cause which I knew not, I searched out. And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.' Yet, though sedate, he was branded as an enthusiast; though cautious, he was styled a fanatic; though a friend of peace, he was reckoned among incendiaries and cut-throats by a wicked and an oppressive people. There is nothing hyperbolical in the assertion of our correspondent below, that friend Shipley by his death 'has left a vacancy in the community, which very few men in the world are qualified to fill.' I trust some particulars of his life will yet be given to the world, in the shape of a biography. In the grief of his bereaved wife and family, whose kindness I shall never cease to remember with feelings of gratitude, I largely participate.The decease of this good man reminds me of a few striking coincidences. It is now nearly three years since the DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS was first promulged to the world by the Anti-Slavery Convention in Philadelphia. Notwithstanding the fury of the times, the tempting rewards offered for the abduction of the most conspicuous abolitionists, the riots which have disgraced and desolated every part of this fair land, the murderous spirit which has every where prevailed, of the sixty-one signers of that Declaration, not one of them has perished by the hand of violence, and only two have died. These two belonged to Philadelphia; both of them were members of the Society of Friends, (though holding conflicting religious opinions,) both were alike from early youth devoted to the cause of bleeding humanity, and both were remarkable for moral courage and disinterested philanthropy THOMAS SHIPLEY and EVAN LEWIS. The latter was indeed a pillar of strength.The following letter, from one of our sterling coadjutors, giving some account of the death and burial of friend SHIPLEY, will be read with thrilling emotions:   because I delivered the poor that cried and him that had none to help him. I searched out. And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.   sixty-one      

               Buffalo, August 29, 1836. Buffalo, August    Mr. EDITOR: Sir I enjoyed the pleasure of attending the anniversary of the Holland Purchase Baptist Association, which was held at Aurora, on the 24th and 25th inst. This association consists of all the Baptist churches in the county of Erie, and some in adjoining counties. It was an interesting occasion. The annual epistles from the several churches seemed to breathe the spirit of christian harmony and good will to all. Several excellent sermons were delivered in reference to the Bible cause, and Foreign and Domestic Missions. Among other items of business, not the least interesting and important, was the adoption of the following resolution:Resolved, That Slavery, as it exists in these United States, is a national sin a hindrance to the spread of the gospel and the extension of the Redeemer's kingdom; and that it calls for the prayers and efforts of Christians to bring it is a speedy termination.The resolution passed without opposition. The congregation being requested to rise, the expression was nearly unanimous, very few only remaining seated. It has long been an inquiry with me why this department of the Christian church, who are republicans in sentiment, and peculiarly so in their form of church government, should so long have remained silent and inactive in regard to this alarming sin against God, and the rights of man? But may we not reasonably hope that this indication of returning life will be speedily followed by more energetic efforts to shake off from the denominations the shabby fig leaf covering of expediency, that they may no longer countenance or tolerate a system of wicked oppression, not only incompatible with Christianity, but which stands condemned in our Declaration of Independence, and ought to be deprecated by every good citizen? A FRIEND OF TRUTH AND HUMANITY.        

     PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 19, 1836.   DEAR GARRISONI have just returned from the funeral of our beloved THOMAS SHIPLEY, the friend of the oppressed, the opener of the prison doors to them that were bound, the successor of Benezet, Franklin, Harrison and Hopper. That benignant, pure, meek, indefatigable, yet quiet spirit, took its departure from this life on Saturday last, about 12 o'clock at noon. His illness was short, and supposed, until a few hours before his death, not to be dangerous. His death has left a vacancy in this community, which very few men in the world are qualified to fill. For thirty years, he has been the untiring and most successful champion of the rights of man in the persons of the poor, the trampled and despised. By day and by night, in sunshine and in storm, in this State, and out of it, he has struggled in their behalf, and wrought the deliverance and vindicated the freedom of hundreds. Our colored brethren and sisters may well weep for him from one end of this continent to the other, and in the isles of the sea; and I wish those, who say that they have no heart, no gratitude or capacity of moral elevation, had been present in this city this day. Arch-street, in which the late mansion of the deceased stands, was filled either way as far as the eye could reach. I was unable to see where the dense assemblage terminated. The majority were colored, but a vast number of whites were interspersed. Nothing could be more respectful and respectable, solemn and decorous, than the appearance and deportment of this immense multitude. It was evident they       within   It was the genuine homage of the heart. It was not an emptying of stables to array a string of empty carriages, to follow in solemn mockery and well and empty fame; but it was that deep and unfeigned expression of love and reverence, which bears witness to the world, that 'the just shall be had in everlasting remembrance.'The remains of THOMAS SHIPLEY were borne to their resting place by colored men. It was delightful to the heart of an abolitionist to see the attachment of this class to their deceased benefactor. At the grave, the voice of a woman of the Society of Friends rose in clear, full and touching accents from the midst of the crowd. I would not, my dear brother, be without the recollection of that moment for a great deal. The discourse was clear, quiet and unaffected eloquence, like Thomas Shipley's own conversation. Like the patriarch ladder, 'it touched the earth and reached to heaven,' concluding with that most beautiful and consolatory text, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren ye have done it unto me.' Other remarks were made, and a prayer offered, as the grave was closing over our friend. I must not omit to mention, that the countenance of the deceased looked as if he were not still upon earth. The lips wore a benign expression, resembling a benevolent smile, and seemed just ready to speak. I never saw so remarkable a look in death. It was much more like celestial life.Farewell, my dear friend, May God bless you and our cause, and sanctify to the good of both this dispensation of his Providence.    my      C.     

       About the year 1790, a sturdy veteran, one Peter Priestley, was clerk, sexton, and gravestone cutter, at the beautiful parish church of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He was an old and very respectable inhabitant of that town, commendably proud of his various offices, and not at all addicted to superstitious fears; if he had ever been so, his long connection with the repositories of the departed, had considerably allayed his apprehensions.It was on a Saturday evening, in a cheerless and gloomy season, that Peter sallied forth from his dwelling to finish an epitaph on a stone, which was to be in readiness for removal before Sunday. Arrived at the church, within which for shelter he had been working, Peter set down his lantern, and lighting his other candle, which stood in a 'potato candlestick,' he resumed his task. The church clock had sometime struck eleven, and some letters were still unexecuted, when lo! a singular noise arrested the arm of Peter, and he looked around him in silent astonishment. The sound perhaps cannot be better expressed than by the word 'hiss,' or 'hush.'Recovering from his surprise, Peter concluded that he had been deceived; especially as his sense of hearing was not remarkably perfect, and he therefore resumed his mallet and chissel very composedly; but in a few minutes his ear was again greeted with the fearful sound of 'hiss!'Peter now rose straight up, and lighting his lantern he searched in vain for the cause whence this uncommon sound proceeded, and was about to quit the church, when the recollection of his promises and imperious necessity withhold him, and he resumed his courage. The hammer of the clock now struck upon the great bell, and it sounded twelve.Peter, having now little more to do than examine and touch up his new letters, was surveying them with downcast head, and more than ordinary minuteness, when louder than ever came upon his ear the dreadful note 'hiss!'And now in truth he stood appalled. Fear had succeeded doubt, and terror fear. He had profaned the morning of the Sabbath, and he was demanded to desist or peradventure the sentence of death had been passed upon him, and he was now himself to be laid among'Whole rows of kindred and acquaintanceBy far his juniors.'With tottering gait, however, Peter now went home and to bed: but sleep had forsaken him. His wife in vain interrogated him as to the nature of his indisposition. Every comfort that the good housewife could, during the night, think of was administered to no purpose. In the morning the good woman, happening to cast her eyes upon the great chair where Peter's wig was suspended, exclaimed with vehemence 'Oh, Peter! what hast thou been doing to burn all t'hair off one side of thy wig?' 'Ah! God bless thee,' vociferated Peter, 'thou hast cured me with that word.' The mysterious 'hiss,' and 'hush,' were sounds from the frizzling of Peter's wig by the flames of his candle, which, to his imperfect sense of hearing, imported things 'horrible an' awfu'. The discovery and the tale afforded Peter and the good people of Wakefield many a joke.        twelve.             

       The following letter has been received from the Count ALEXANDER DE LABORDE at Paris, Secretary of the French Society for the Abolition of Slavery. I deem it an honor to be associated, by election, with the distinguished philanthropists whose names are affixed to the letter, and their benevolent colleagues, not on account of the high conventional rank which they hold in France, but because the object of pursuit is one of mercy and good-will to a people scattered and peeled, meted out, and trodden under foot, and one of glory to God in the highest and because it cannot but be honorable to be recognized in other lands as the steadfast friend of universal liberty, and the uncompromising enemy of brutal slavery. In Scotland, they have given a similar token of approbation of my humble labors in the great cause of human rights, by placing me upon the same list of honorary and corresponding members with George Washington Lafayette and Victor de Tracey of France, and Daniel O'Connell of Ireland. These marks of respect are gratifying chiefly as they serve as fresh refutations of the flagrant charges brought against me, in common with my abolition brethren, by the enemies of emancipation in this country.A powerful union is now formed between the abolitionists of England, France, and America, for the extirpation of slavery and the slave trade from the face of the whole earth. 'A three-fold cord is not easily broken.' In this grand alliance, other nations will be invited to join, and the glorious work of redemption will be consummated in due time, wherever a slave pines in bondage.    America    PARIS, July 23, 1836.   SIR:We have the honor of informing you, that the French Society for the Abolition of Slavery has elected you a corresponding member of its association.We hope that you will consent to unite your philanthropic efforts with ours, for the success of the worthy cause, the triumph of which we so ardently desire, and for which you have already done so much.The Society will receive with gratitude, sir, all the documents concerning the abolition of slavery published in America, and will transmit to you all those published in France.Receive, sir, and dear colleague, the assurance of our high consideration, &c.LA ROCHEFOUCAULT LIANCOURT,AL.

       Our indefatigable coadjutor, Mr. H.B. STANTON, has lectured in this section, since our last notice of his proceedings, as follows:Dover, Concord, and Great Falls, N.H. Wednesday evening, Sept. 7, he addressed an audience in the Rev. David Root's church, at Dover. In the afternoon of Thursday, he met the friends of the cause, and after explaining the operations of the American Society, a subscription was opened, which, with the liberal sum given by the ladies, amounted to $100. Thursday evening, he addressed a highly respectable audience in Mr. Root's church. Friday evening, our friend addressed a large audience in the Town Hall at Concord. The County Court being in session, several gentlemen in attendance on business from the country, were present. All was concord within and without, and liberal donations were made to the cause. Sunday afternoon, Mr. S. spoke to a large audience, nearly two hours, in the Baptist Meeting-house at Great Falls. The cause takes deep hold in this flourishing village. Our friends, though not rich in this world's goods, gave freely to maintain the work. Sunday evening, Mr. Stanton spoke again in Dover.Portsmouth, N.H. Monday afternoon, he addressed a few friends of the cause in Portsmouth. The anti-aristocratical principles of abolitionism have made but little progress, as yet, in this town. But, 'upward and onward' is the motto of our friends there.Portland, Me. From Portsmouth, our fellow laborer went the next day to Portland. Here the demon of mobs marshalled his forces. We extract the following account of the riot from the Portland Journal of Reform, of the 21st inst.:'ANTI-SLAVERY IN PORTLAND, MOBS, &c. Notice having been given that Mr. H.B.

Anti-Slavery Society, would lecture upon Slavery at the Friends' Chapel on Tuesday evening last, a large number of our citizens assembled at the appointed hour, for the purpose of listening to his remarks.At the commencement of the lecture there were few if any indications of a riot, and it was thought that the meeting would pass off, as many similar ones have in our peaceable city, without disturbance. But the lecturer had scarcely commenced speaking before the sound of a tin horn 'braying horrible discord' and a shout loud enough to drown his voice, undeceived us. The house was immediately surrounded with a host of miscreants, who commenced pelting the windows with stones, throwing some very heavy ones into the house, and in various ways trying to break up the assembly.Stanton very judiciously advised his audience to keep quiet, fix their eyes on him, and pay no attention whatever to what was going on outside. By this means, less embarrassment was experienced than was apprehended. The shouting, &c. was continued till the close of the address, when the rioters dispersed of their own accord. No police officer was present.Subsequently, another meeting was appointed for the next evening, and the Mayor was requested to provide force, to suppress disturbance if there should be any. Before the hour of meeting arrived, a dense crowd had assembled about the door, so that it was with difficulty the well disposed could make their way into the house. They were likewise collected here and there in squads, using exciting and threatening language, and evidently getting warm for a fierce onset. But the Mayor had done his part in sending several constables, and appeared among them in person, and thus no doubt a large amount of the turbulence which was to have been displayed, was checked.The lecturer began, while a Sabbath stillness reigned out of doors as well as in: a stillness which lasted with only two or three interruptions till he closed. At one time there was a general shout; at another a slight rush near the door, and occasionally, the rattling of glass told that the stones were flying through the windows. Though the mob had assembled, and were organized, with leaders and a watchword, with the avowed intention of breaking up the meeting and dragging Stanton from the desk, yet the calmness of the speaker and audience, and the resoluteness of the Mayor completely confounded them. When Stanton left the house, the mob followed him, shouting; but though unprotected, not one of them dated to lay the weight of this finger. By the advice of the City officers, they soon after dispersed; and so ended the first Anti-Abolition Mob of Portland. It is pleasing to add, that there was not among them a single 'gentleman of property and standing'; not one, who can lay any claim to respectability.Perhaps, after the retraction which our citizens have made, of sentiments advocated and approved by them at the City Hall on the evening of the 5th of August, 1835 by sending one of the men whom they then denounced as an insurrectionist, a disorganizer, and a traitor, to represent their interests in the State Legislature; and after R.A.L. Codman, by certain resolutions offered by him at the recent convention at Gray, deprecating the slightest infringement upon the free discussion of any subject, has retracted the threat, we will put Abolitionists down, peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must, which he then made, it may seem ungenerous to attribute this mob, its origin, and the great moving power of it to that meeting. Yet we know not where else to look for its source; and justice to the rioters, and several facts within our knowledge, compel us to say that there this brat was born, and if 'gentlemen of property and standing' were not otherwise related to it, they may at least thank themselves for having begotten it.No one who attended that meeting, can doubt that its legitimate tendency was to breathe into the bosoms of the degraded, half-reasoning beings who are among us, a hellish, mobocratic spirit, and to direct its fury against the peaceable, unoffending heads of Abolitionists. Let the fiendish yells that shook the Hall, when John Neal spoke of mobbing Thompson, and Codman uttered the sentiment above alluded to, bear witness. The seeds of this mob, and of every future one, should there by any, were there planted, and all who were active in getting up and conducting that meeting, are the sowers, and are responsible for the fruit. True, it is a year since it was held, and all has hitherto been quiet. What then? This is the first opportunity Abolitionists have ever given for the manifestation of the spirit there inculcated. It is the first time they have held an evening meeting to listen to an Anti-Slavery address, since the 15th August, 1835. But another fact will settle this point. I ask that it may be deeply pondered, and if there is one who was active in that assembly, who has not repented of his base and wicked conduct, let the shame kindle now. Said one who may be considered a leader of the mob, 'The PEOPLE have said, that IF ABOLITIONISTS CANNOT BE PUT DOWN BY FAIR MEANS, THEY MUST BY FOUL, and that is the way we mean to serve them.'Mr. Stanton informs us, that he lectured five times in Portland. The last meeting was on Thursday afternoon, and was not molested. All the Churches in the town were closed against the lectures. Whether this had a tendency to encourage the rioters, all can readily determine. The refusal to permit a meeting-house to be used for the discussion of a subject, when politely asked for by respectable citizens, is virtually saying that such subject is unfit to be discussed in a meeting-house. If these things are done in a green tree, what will be done in the dry?  That is, if churches refuse to open their doors that the cause of the Lord's poor may be advocated in their pulpits, what will the profane and the intemperate do? Answer.  Mob down the friends of the cause, and hurl brickbats and stones at the heads of its advocates. We believe all the orthodox Congregational ministers in Portland, belong to the 'American Union for the Relief and Improvement of the Colored Race.' Of course, they have no sympathy with the Abolitionists. The rabble know this.During the riot, our friends stood their ground firmly yet peaceably. They were determined to exercise their rights. While stones of a dangerous size were hurled through the windows, scarcely a muscle moved, and the whole audience sat with eyes riveted, on the speaker, who, for about two hours, advocated, not unmoved but undismayed, the rights of man, bond and free. The ladies particularly evinced a calm courage above all praise.Effects of the riot. Mr. S. visited Portland, to procure funds for the American Anti-Slavery Society. When a subscription was opened, one gentleman remarked that he had intended to give five dollars, but, in consideration of the mob, he would give fifteen. Another gentleman did the same. Another remarked, that he had thought of giving about $10, but he now thought he would add a cypher at the right hand.  He gave $100.North Yarmouth, Me. Thursday evening. Mr. Stanton lectured to a quiet and intelligent audience, in North Yarmouth, and returned to Portland the same evening.Bradford, Mass. Friday evening, the 16th inst., Messrs. Burleigh and Stanton addressed a large audience in the Rev. Gardner B. Perry's meeting house at Bradford. Our friends in that section are taking vigorous measures to send in a large petition to Congress, praying for the Abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia. We believe Essex Co. will be erect at the opening of the next Session of Congress, and will be represented there by a strong array of petitioners, male and female.Weymouth and Braintree.  Sunday evening, Mr. Stanton spoke nearly two hours to a large audience in the Rev. Mr. Perkins's meeting house. A liberal donation was made to the cause by the friends present.Hanover. Monday afternoon, he spoke at Hanover; in the Rev. Mr. Duncan's meeting house. A very respectable audience was present. Here a pleasing incident occurred. A company of Artillery were performing military duty, in the immediate vicinity of the meeting house. Instead of taking opportunity to disturb the meeting, they marched into the house at the beat of the drum and quietly seating themselves, listened more than an hour to the remarks of the speaker. In the evening, Mr. S. addressed a crowded auditory in the Baptist church. A strong impulse was given to the cause, and nearly $200 paid over to sustain it.Groton. Thursday evening, and Friday afternoon and evening, Mr. S. lectured in the Congregational meeting house, at Groton. The cause is onward in G., notwithstanding the great opposition our friends encounter.Dorchester.  Last Sunday evening, our friend spoke two hours to a crowded audience in the town hall at Dorchester.Cambridge-Port.

       THE Subscriber has opened a boarding house, at No. 81, 'Weybosset Street, Providence, for the accommodation' of genteel persons of color.     WINSOR GARDNER.   Sept. 17.    

       Whoever has candidly read the discussion between Mr. Thompson and Mr. Breckinridge, at Glasgow, will require no other evidence to convince him that the triumph of the former, in decorum, urbanity, argument and eloquence, over his haughty opponent, was as signal as any ever yet witnessed by an impartial world. Indeed, the utter discomfiture of Mr. Breckinridge is made apparent by the silence and mortification of our pre-slavery opponents. So contemptible an opinion does even the editor of the Boston Recorder hold of the manner in which Mr. B. vindicated this country, that he very significantly says, the controversy is not worth reprinting on this side the Atlantic! meaning that the Maryland champion having made a bad matter worse, the public sentiment is too far enlightened in this country, now, to be influenced by his representations, except in favor of the abolition cause: for if he had succeeded, even plausibly, in his defence, our opponents would not have been backward in publishing the entire debate instanter. To the distinguished abilities of Mr. Thompson, millions bear witness Mr. B. is also, indisputably, a man of no ordinary powers of mind. Now, for the Recorder to say, that the discussion between such renowned antagonists, in a city like Glasgow, and on a subject involving the character of American Christianity, is not worth reprinting here, is in other words plainly acknowledging that Mr. T. was victorious.But we have now the decision of the most enlightened citizens of Glasgow, expressed in the most unequivocal and public manner, upon the discussion alluded to, which will be found in our columns to-day. The tribute to Mr. Thompson is indeed as splendid as it is gratifying. The speech of Rev. Dr. WARDLAW must prove, in all its parts and particulars, a blister to the lips and tongues of our opponents, and the slanderers of Mr. Thompson: it is worthy of the head and heart of that eminent divine, chaste, pungent, generous, eloquent, irresistible. How strong is the testimony which he bears to the moral and intellectual supremacy of Mr. T.; to his matchless efforts in the cause of emancipation; to his triumph over him able but malignant antagonist! And how ought it to make such men as Dr. Fisk, David M. Reese, the editors of the New York Observer, Boston Recorder, and all of like affinity, hang their heads in confusion and shame. We should think, too, that the editor of the Christian Register would feel as small as the moto that floats in the sunshine, after his false and sneering charge against Mr. T., that 'his reported addresses, since his return, abound in similar gibes and jeers, vehement invectives, bitter denunciations, and exaggerated personalities, for which they were distinguished here.' The American correspondent of the New York Press, at Glasgow, must also feel in a comfortable predicament, after writing an account of the result of the controversy, as follows:'Mr. Breckinridge received, at the conclusion of the debate, the hearty applause of the crowded audience, and there is no doubt now that the people of Glasgow have a true idea of the real condition of the United States as it regards slavery. Mr. Thompson has hitherto been a lion in Glasgow, and has carried all before him, but Mr. Breckinridge handsomely caged him in this contest. The Americans in Glasgow who heard him, behaved nobly. Though their feelings would have prompted them at times to tear him in pieces, when he was denouncing their beloved land, yet they listened with as much apparent calmness, as if they were Englishmen.  It is understood that Mr. B. has received from many of the most intelligent citizens in Glasgow, the warmest acknowledgements for his candid and intelligent exposure of the real condition of slavery, and of the parties relating to it in the United States.'What veracity and consistency! It is amusing to hear of men listening with calmness, yet feeling prompted to tear Mr. T. in pieces!We have not room for further comment, except to advise Mr. Joseph Tracy to read and digest the remarks of Dr. Wardlaw upon West India emancipation. The pill will be hard to swallow.      Though their feelings would have prompted them at times to tear him in pieces they listened with as much apparent calmness, as if they were Englishmen.        

       It seems, by a letter from the Rev. John Scoble, inserted in another column, that Mr. Thompson, 'the renegade, the felon,' &c. &c. has been received by a great meeting in Exeter Hall, London, with unbounded applause, which was addressed by him with electrical effect. A report of his speech will probably be received soon. The resolutions adopted at the meeting will animate our abolition brethren exceedingly. Truly, the moral power of the world is on our side, and against the slaveholder and his vile abettors. Our cause is onward, mightily.    

 CINCINNATI MOB. We have just received in pamphlet form, a 'Narrative of the late riotous proceedings against the Liberty of the Press in Cincinnati with remarks and historical notices, relating to Emancipation' from the pen of JAMES G. BIRNEY. It is ably written, and discloses scenes, and records sentiments, which will shock and astonish posterity.     

 The great length of the report of the public meeting in Glasgow unavoidably compels us to defer the remainder of the very able Argument of Ellis Gray Loring, Esq. to another number.     

 The 'beautiful lines' ascribed to our pen in a late number of the Essex Gazette, by our poetical and philanthropic friend Whittier, were not written by us.
