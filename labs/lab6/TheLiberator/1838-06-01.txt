       The last number of the Pennsylvania Freeman (edited by John G. Whittier, and published in Philadelphia) contains a long, able and eloquent address of the Eastern Executive Committee of the State Anti-Slavery Society to the Citizens of Pennsylvania giving a circumstantial and accurate account of the various meetings which were held in Pennsylvania Hall, prior to its destruction by the mob, and also of the savage outrages which have afflicted and disgraced the city of Philadelphia. Our limits will allow us to insert only the following extracts from this address the spirit of which is worthy of a martyr-age, and of the best men of any clime or people. It furnishes a striking contrast to the vulgar, billingsgate, malevolent spirit exhibited in the article we have copied from the Colonization Herald.Not in vain, we trust, has the persecution fallen upon us. Fresher and purer for its fiery baptism, the cause lives in our hearts. We now know and feel our responsibilities. Called, even in our weakness, to stand forth as the asserters and defenders of freedom, in the place and her of her extremest peril, woe unto us if we falter through the fear of man! If, shrinking from a manifest call of duty, we yield up great PRINCIPLES a sacrifice to popular fury, if to save life and property we offer up all that can make the one tolerable or the other useful, we commit a crime against God and humanity, which words cannot measure. Were we to yield a single principle at this crisis, the voice of a world's execration would justly brand us as TRAITORS TO LIBERTY.Citizens of Pennsylvania! your rights as well as ours have been violated in this dreadful outrage. The blow has been aimed at the universal rights of man! The sacrifice of a beautiful temple dedicated to liberty, and bearing the motto of our state, 'VIRTUE, LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE,' has been made to SOUTHERN SLAVERY to a system whose advocates unblushingly declare that the laborer should every where, at the North as well as the South, in Pennsylvania as well as in Carolina, be made the property of the employer and the capitalist. In the heart of your free city within view of the Hall of Independence, whose spire and roof reddened in the flame of the sacrifice the deed has been done, and the shout which greeted the falling ruin was the shout of Slavery over the grave of Liberty. It was such as greeted the ear of the Russian despot over the dead corpses and smouldering ruins of conquered Warsaw such as the Turkish tyrant heard amidst the ghastly horrors of Scio. We ask of you as men jealous of your own rights, and your own liberties, to reflect upon the inevitable consequences, which must follow the toleration of such an outrage. If you have studied the history of past republics, you have not yet to learn that the sacrifice of the rights of a part of the community, has ended in the enslavement of all. The rights of the individual have never been disregarded by any nation or people with impunity. It is an ordinance of Providence, that that community which violates its own principles for the purpose of depriving any of its members of their acknowledged rights, digs in so doing the grave of its own liberties.If it be inquired of us, what course we mean to pursue in this time of trial, our answer is brief. We shall move onward in the right line of duty, persevering in the promulgation and defence of those righteous principles which we have ever upheld, confining ourselves, as we ever have done, to the exertion of moral power, and the use of peaceful means. We shall plead with renewed and still increasing energy, the cause of the down-trodden poor, acknowledging in our practice, as well as our words, the universal brotherhood of man, and that we believe, what almost all profess, that 'all men are created equal' in rights, and that those rights are inalienable. We are well aware that the wordly wise would recommend a temporising expediency a pause in our exertions a bending to the storm, till its fury be overpast. The rhetoric may be fine which enforces such counsel, with similes of the reed rising after the blast, and the rigid oak shivered and prostrated for its obstinacy; but the policy it recommends, we utterly repudiate. The yielding reed may rise, but it bends again at the next gust. Who would lean on it for support? Who would rely on it as a prop to his feeble steps? The pliancy which saves it, proves it not worth saving. No! never let this supple plant, which seeks safety by tamely bowing before violence, be the emblem of the Anti-Slavery cause or its advocates. Let them be rather like the rock-rooted oak, which gathers fresh strength from its resistance to the tempest, and never bending till it breaks, continues to give support to those who recline against it, as long as it can sustain itself. Are we told of the events of the past week, and warned of the future? Our answer is ready. Our fathers preferred the maintenance of their rights to the preservation of life itself, and we should be degenerate sons indeed, if, when not our own rights alone, but those of the enslaved millions of our sinful land, of the millions yet to be born to an inheritance of degradation and oppression, or of liberty and honor, according as we succeed or fail, are depending on the issue of our moral enterprise, we should tremble and falter, and shrink from the contest as soon as [ ] waxes warm, and thickens with difficulty and [ ] and peril. Are we pointed to the smoking ruins of that beautiful Temple of Freedom, which we fondly hoped would long have echoed the noble and free sentiments of a Franklin, a Rush, a Benezet, a Lay, and as we look sadly on its early downfall, are we bidden to learn hence the fate of our own dwellings, if we persevered. Think not the intimation will drive us from our post. No! rather will we gather in handfuls, the yet warm ashes of the ruined edifice, and cast them toward heaven, that they may come down in boils and blains upon the monster Slavery, eating with caustic energy to his very vitals, and consuming his life-blood with what he had vainly deemed should be his nourishment. We shall go on then, calmly but firmly. Our work is too holy, too great, too intimately [ ] with all that we hold dear for ourselves, [ ] for our fellow-men, or desire for our [ ], to be lightly abandoned at the appearance of difficulty, or timidly given over at the approach of danger. We feel that God has called us to this work, and if it is his purpose that we should finish what we have begun, he can preserve us, though it be as in the lion's den, or the seven-fold heated furnace; that he will deliver us out of every danger, and uphold us by His free Spirit, until all is accomplished that he has given us to do. If he has otherwise ordained, and designs to permit the wicked to triumph for a little season, and the witnesses for his truth to be slain in the streets of our city, we shall have at least the satisfaction of reflecting that we fall at the post of duty, with our wounds in the breast and not the back; and that he whose work we are doing can raise up other laborers to reap the rich harvest whose seed we have sown, and whose growth our blood will have nourished.      every where, the property of the employer and the capitalist.    believe, profess,

Edward Beecher, President of Illinois College:     'ILLINOIS COLLEGE,'March 11th, 1838.    Dear Sir, It is quite doubtful whether my duties to the college will allow me to visit the East this spring. ... Should it seem my duty, on general considerations, to make the journey. I shall find great pleasure in attending the meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society, and doing all in my power to promote its interest, and to promote the holy cause in which it is engaged. ....May the Spirit of the Lord be with you at your next meeting, and may he at once arouse this nation fro[ ] lethargy on this momentous subject, and give a speedy triumph to this glorious cause.

 Letter from F. Julius LeMoyne, M.D., Washington Co., Pa., President of the Pennsylvania State Anti-Slavery Society:      WASHINGTON, PA., Feb. 27th, 1838.   Dear Sir, Your letter containing the request of the Executive Committee, of which you are Chairman, that I should participate in the anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, to be held in New York, on the 8th of May next, is before me.After giving the request due consideration, I am compelled, with reluctance, however, to decline your kind invitation Duly sensible of the honor conferred by your selection, and aware of the duty which rests upon each advocate of the cause of God and the slave, to make great sacrifices to meet the responsibilities which are involved in the present crisis of the reformation. I yet cannot see that it would be consistent with other responsibilities, which surround me, to meet you on that occasion.'The solemnity of our position seems to me to be increasing every day. We stand as it were between the living and the dead betwixt an offended and insulted God, and a guilty (and unless we soon repent) a devoted and doomed people. Oh! how prudent and faithful how devoted and prayerful how zealous and self-sacrificing we ought and must be laboring as if every thing depended upon our efforts yet depending upon [ ] and so implicitly, as if all our exertions were as nought, and His blessing the one thing needful.You have our sincere desires and prayers for such a meeting as will tell powerfully upon the present and eternal welfare of this people, both bond and free, and hasten on a day of jubilee, which will overshadow our present Holiday, which will be had in everlasting remembrance, when liberty will be proclaimed throughout all the land, and unto all the inhabitants thereof.

       Abolition Riot. Our town, like many others in the country, has at length been disgraced by an abolition riot. Bills were posted up in various parts of the town, the latter part of last week announcing that an abolition meeting was to be held on Monday evening, the 21st inst. at the New Market Church; but very little notice, however, was apparently taken of it at the time. On the evening of the meeting, however, some five or six hundred persons, as we understand, gathered in front of the building, and soon after commenced the work of destruction by breaking in the windows, doors, &c. with stones, which soon dispersed those inside. After these had retired, the mob also soon dispersed, without doing any more injury to the building.But we do not wish to dwell on these painful and disgraceful proceedings. However misjudged the measures of the abolitionists may be deemed to be, it must be regretted that any portion of a professedly free and intelligent community should suffer themselves to be led to the perpetration of lawless violence with a view to prevent them. Even if it were not a violation of the sacred rights of freedom of opinion and free discussion, but a mere question of policy, a moment's reflection would show that all the advantage gained is on the side of the abolitionists, while crime and disgrace, and perhaps punishment, are the only fruits reaped by those who riotously oppose them.  Abolition Riot     

    'Lewis Tappan, Esq., New York.     WASHINGTON, April 7th, 1838.   'Dear Sir, I have duly received your letter of the 29th of last month, communicating to me the invitation of the Committee of Arrangements of the American Anti-Slavery Society, of my attendance at their fifth anniversary on the 8th of next month at New York.'I feel myself honored by this invitation, and however the operations of my own judgment have brought me to conclusions, with regard to the expediency of certain measures deeply interesting to the Union, and anxiously favored by them, different from theirs, I entertain a sincere respect for their intentions, and welcome in the purposes of their association the most efficient means prepared by Providence for the preservation of the freedom of our country from the contamination of slavery.'My public duties will detain me here probably through the whole month of May. During the session of Congress, I do not hold myself at liberty to absent myself voluntarily from the service of the House, a single day: Such is my estimate of the representative duty, confirmed by a positive rule of the House itself, not the less obligatory for being little observed. It will not, therefore, be in my power to attend the meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society upon their anniversary, but my best wishes will be with them, that their institution may be blessed with the smile and approbation of Heaven for the promotion of the general cause of human liberty, and for the extermination from the face of the earth of the doctrine fit to have issued from the head of Caligula, or the heart of Nero, that bondage is the appropriate corner-stone to the temple of freedom.

                 The present is an important week for the anti-slavery cause in New-England. The Convention will organize this morning, (Wednesday,) at 8 o'clock, for business, in the vestry of the Marlboro' Chapel; a public meeting is to be held in the Chapel this afternoon, at 3 o'clock also to-morrow (Thursday) morning, at 9 o'clock, in the same place. It is intended, also, to hold public meetings in the Chapel on Friday forenoon, afternoon, and evening, at which time the Convention will probably adjourn. Our paper goes to press too early to enable us to give any account of the proceedings in our present number. The delegates are flocking into the city from all quarters, embodying a large amount of the talent and eloquence of the country. We anticipate highly interesting meetings. The late Vandal acts in Philadelphia will give a new impulse to the Convention.    

             Delivered at the late annual meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Delivered at the late annual meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society     Dr. Smith said  Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I rise to offer a resolution, expressive of our high satisfaction in the noble efforts of the abolitionists of Great Britain and France, who, although they are separated from us by the width of an ocean, and by distinct political institutions, are nevertheless united with us in sentiment and exertion in the sacred cause of immediate and universal emancipation: and, sir, whether we look at their position amongst the nations of the earth, the principles by which they seem actuated, or the measures which, in this cause, they have adopted, we have abundant reason to rejoice, and cannot but be thankful to Him who hath raised up for us, in our time of need, such devoted and efficient coadjutors.With these two nations we are connected by ties of the closest amity, and enjoy greater reciprocal influence than with any others upon the globe. To these nations, our struggle for independence gave the first impulse to the path of liberty, which, if they have trod with slower, they have trod with more consistent steps than we: for every step they have advanced, each measure they have gained, has been an advantage not only to themselves, but to all who are dependant on them. And whenever the people of Great Britain or of France have obtained any portion of civil liberty, their first exercise of it has been to extend the precious boon to their fellow-subjects, held in the galling chains of West Indian Slavery. In the last century, the first Convention elected by the French people, immediately abolished slavery in two French Colonies: and in the present, the passing of the British reform Bill, has rapidly been followed by the abolition of British West Indian slavery. France, indeed, set the first, the most glorious and most instructive example. It was the most glorious example, because liberty was conferred without stint or restriction, without any lengthened delay to sicken hope, or purgatorial state to blast expectation; it was sudden and entire; the man who until yesterday had toiled in the field, and had known no other incentive to labor than the cartwhip, was to-day raised to the dignity and privileges of a citizen of the republic; the woman who until yesterday had sobbed over her youngling, and besought the grave to snatch it from the horror of existence, to-day held it towards the skies and shrieked, He is free!This example has proved most instructive; for when France again bent her neck to the iron yoke of a ruthless tyrant, and suffered her sons to be slaughtered at the altar of ambitious despotism, the men whom she had so suddenly liberated showed themselves worthy of their freedom: for, against the veterans of Europe's conqueror, against an armament sent out by the empire which overwhelmed Napoleon, amidst the loathing and scorn of a neighboring republic, and the cold and bitter neglect of all nations, they have maintained their freedom, until now, when generous and consistent France, inspired with the genius of modern abolitionism, by acknowledging the independence of Hayti, completes the triumph which revolutionary France began. France, then, has been the first to grant immediate and entire emancipation, and the first to acknowledge the right and capacity of a community of freedmen to rank among the nations of the earth. And although she (France) still holds 260,000 slaves in some of her dependencies, yet recent movements, nearly akin to her pristine efforts, promise these a speedy liberation. At the session of 1837, M. Passy gave notice to the French Chamber of Deputies, that he would, in the ensuing session, bring forward and take occasion to discuss the question of the emancipation of those slaves. When the next session arrived, that gentleman in the fulfilment of his promise brought forward a resolution to the effect, that the children of slaves born after the promulgation of an act for the purpose, should be free. After an able and interesting debate, which involved the whole question of slavery, not only was this resolution adopted, but the Deputies seemed very desirous that the gentlemen should go still further, and propose a measure that might strike nearer to the root of the evil. M. Passy is the Vice President of the French Abolition Society, an association, by the way, which almost owes its existence to the remonstrances of the Glasgow Emancipation Society; and who can imagine the joy of his heart, when, in presenting the resolution to the Legislature, doubtful whether they would even discuss the question to which it related, he found them not only willing for discussion, not only adopting his motion, but actually desirous to go beyond it! There was some opposition certainly, and this as usual came from the ministry. Strange what a link there seems to be between ministry and slavery, that men in the possession of political power are such warm advocates for the continuance of slavery yet the resolution passed, and the next session will probably witness a still more glorious movement in favor of abolition. Sir, this transaction is one of the most cheering that has occurred in the history of abolitionism. For we here find a legislative body, without any recurrence to the primary assemblies of the people, without being urged by petitions or bound by pledges, without being incited by the tales of horror that always accompany slavery, for it is a remarkable fact that the slaves of Catholics are better fed and better treated than those of Protestants: I say we find a legislative body without any of the ordinary inducements, at the first discussion of the subject, not only adopting the measure proposed by the most sanguine of the abolitionists, but actually desirous of advancing still further. This was a manifestation of principle, at which we may blush as Amerinans, but rejoice as men: and unwilling as I am to utter any remark or draw any comparison reflecting even the slightest discredit on  Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen          yet there is something in the facts, which, however humbling, may yet prove instructive. The very year that witnessed in our Hall of Representatives, the appalling spectacle of a venerable man, hooted and howled at when he sought even the right to petition in behalf of the slave, the same year beheld the legislature of King-ridden, priest-ridden, and as some say, infidel France, cheering on an abolitionist in his measures for emancipation.Mr. President, if we next turn our eyes toward Great Britain, on whose dominions the sun never sets, whilst they extend through every clime, we find her the neighbor of almost every nation, and therefore capable of influencing all: and this influence is regulated by those sound principles for which she is so justly distinguished, which are her shelter in the hour of danger, and her glory in the day of prosperity. Sound as these principles are on all other questions, they are pre-eminently so on that question which we are this day met to forward. For if, unwittingly, the British people became deeply imbrued in the blood-guiltiness of slavery and the slave trade, yet as soon as they became aware of the enormity of the crime, and possessed the power to remove it, they made signal and instantaneous atonement, by the immediate emancipation of their 800,000 slaves. And this great movement was distinguished by none of the bitterness of a political contest, none of the selfishness of a political victory. And when the battle was over and the victory won, the men who had gained it the dissenters of England and Scotland still heard the clank of chains, the groans of men and the wail of women held in slavery by other nations. They heard these sounds, and they felt the principles by which they had recently been stirred still glow within them, and expand their benevolence beyond the limits of a single empire: they felt the force of that sentiment uttered nearly a thousand years ago by an African slave, Homo sum humani nil alienum a ma puto. They felt that their country was the world, their countrymen mankind, and were urged by motives that they could not resist to make the attempt to disenthral all their countrymen: and they bound themselves by solemn compact, to begin a moral agitation that shall not cease until the last fetter shall fall from the last slave upon our earth.They formed the British Society for the immediate and universal emancipation of slaves, and the consequent destruction of the slave trade throughout the world.Sir, what are the means by which they hope to obtain so glorious a result? The means are simple, but with God's blessing, they will prove efficient. With the Bible in their hands, and its precepts for their guide, they are determined calmly, but earnestly and incessantly, to remonstrate with all slaveholders, and to beseech them to liberate their slaves.Their first effort was directed against slavery and the slave trade in our republic. They subsequently determined, by means of the same gifted and devoted agent whom they had sent here, thoroughly to abolitionize Great Britain and Ireland, in order that remonstrances might be sent from the great body of christians of that empire, imploring the christians of these United States to abolish American slavery. Some of those remonstrances we have already received. And although, at the present time, their efforts are devoted to another and more appropriate object, the entire abolition of the last vestige of slavery, which yet lingers in their colonies under the name of apprenticeship, yet as soon as they have abolished the apprenticeship system and they will do so, even if it be but one hour sooner than its appointed expiration, yet they will obtain that hour, in order that the principles of immediate emancipation may, in their colonies, vanquish the chicanery of slavery in its very metamorphosis then, sir, with the renewed zeal, the additional experience, and the force of the complete example which this victory will give them, they will bring all their energies to bear upon slavery as it exists in these states.We may rejoice then, sir, in the present efforts of the British abolitionists, on account of the principle for which they are made. It is a struggle for immediate instead of gradual emancipation, and must, therefore, merit the sympathies, the good wishes and the co-operation of all who are in favor of immediate emancipation. We may rejoice in their efforts, on account of the proof which they give to the world of the superiority, nay the necessity of immediate, instead of gradual emancipation. Should the apprenticeship, which works so badly, be permitted to continue until 1840, the evils which have resulted, and the insurrections which might arise from it, would be, to the slaveholder, an argument against emancipation in any form, and to many friends of liberty, an argument for very gradual emancipation. The position in which the British abolitionists are now placed, must convince slaveholders that they must grant, and abolitionists that they must obtain immediate emancipation, else they will be forced to 'fight their battles o'er again.'We may rejoice in these efforts, on account of the renewed zeal which they will infuse into the abolition party of Great Britain; for it is the peculiar glory of abolitionism, as well as of all moral enterprises, that contest whets the mind, and invigorates it for other and more difficult undertakings. One moral victory gained, raises the mind to an eminence whence it perceives others that must be achieved, and inspires it with new energies for the struggle. The British slave trade being abolished, the British Anti-Slavery Society for gradual emancipation was formed; from this, sprung the society for immediate emancipation; this, as it was thought, being obtained in the British colonies, their (the abolitionists') views grew larger, their benevolence embraced the globe, and the society for immediate and universal emancipation was the result and since, in this manner, each step advanced has increased their zeal and enlarged their views, we cannot doubt that their present efforts will be attended with similar effects. Indeed, sir, their present exertions have not only increased the zeal of the abolitionists, but they have added new and invaluable auxiliaries to their ranks. The flame of abolitionism is no longer confined to the dissenters of Great Britain; it has even penetrated within the walls of the church established by law; and bishops of the church of England have at length discovered that the advocacy of the cause of God's suffering poor, is not inconsistent with apostolic order. Men of every rank and of every sect are gathering around the standard of abolition, and they forget the rancor of party, and the clashing of creeds, in their common anxiety to disenthral the slave; and the great principle from which this anxiety grows that of loving all men is, imperceptibly to themselves, diffusing its healing influence over the hostile parties for once united; dissenter and churchman, protestant and papist, standing on the broad platform of humanity, and covered with the mantle of charity, are beginning to love one another whilst united to manifest their common love towards the crushed and bleeding slave. And when the apprenticeship is abolished, this mass of mind, animated by the principle which now unites it, and in the exercise of the same, will devote its entire energies to the emancipation of our slaves. And the christians of Great Britain will call upon those of these states in one long and loud and incessant series of remonstrances, entreating them to follow the British example.Sir, I admire this method of remonstrance. Judging from those we have already received, they seem to be of the right tone, and calculated to effect much good. I deem the method of remonstrance right, because it is warranted by the usages of nations in past and at the present time. In our own time, one government has freely remonstrated with another on the destruction of the African slave trade: why, then, may not one people who are the source of all governmental power remonstrate with another for the abolition of slavery? The people of these United States, at least that very large and respectable portion of them which constitute the American Temperance Society, have remonstrated with the British people on the sin of intemperance; have not the people of Britain an equal right to remonstrate with us on the equally heinous sin of slavery? But, sir, not only has remonstrance, in other words, moral interference, been sanctioned by common usage and our own practice, but British interference in our slave question has actually been solicited, and solicited too by all the good and the great of our land, who are at this moment receiving pecuniary assistance from a few of the British people for the abolition of American slavery by means of colonization. Can the good and the great complain, then, if other British subjects, once solicited by the same agent, see fit to strive for the self-same object by remonstrating with the slaveholder on the justice, safety and expediency of immediate emancipation?But, Sir, common usage may be wrong, the Temperance and even the Colonization Society may be wrong in sanctioning national interference in national sins. I still plead for the right of remonstrance on higher grounds than common usage, or the sanction of moral reforming associations. Christians are governed by the laws peculiar to the Commonwealth of Christ, and which are independent of mere human laws imposed by human communities; the citizens of the Church Catholic of the Redeemer may be spread through many climes, and subject to various forms of political government, but no difference in clime, no diversity in form of political creed, can break the links which make them fellow citizens in Christ, or free them from obedience to the precepts of the Saviour. One of these precepts is, that they may rebuke one another in love; and another is, that they may exhort each other to 'good works.' Reposing on these precepts and obedient to them, the christians of Britain have a right to call upon the christians of these United States to desist from the sin of slaveholding. I have thus, sir, imperfectly laid before you a few reasons why we may rejoice in the noble efforts of the Abolitionists of France and Great Britain. Of the latter, after five years' residence among them, during all which time I was favored with a seat in their councils, and marked their every movement, I may state it as my deliberate conviction that they are actuated in this cause by the purest benevolence, and the most sound discretion. And it is my firm belief that could their hearts be laid bare to the inspection of any southern slaveholder, he would find nothing there but christian love toward the master himself, as well as toward his slave.Mr. President, the resolution which I hold in my hand, states that we not only rejoice in the efforts of the transatlantic abolitionists, but also pledge them our co-operation in the cause. Sir, in order to co-operate with them, we must not only acknowledge their principles, we must also adopt their practice. If we look at the British example, we find that in their pursuit of the Universal, they omit no one of the particulars of which that universal is made up. Their abolitionism is thorough. It began at home. They first consecrated their own soil to liberty so that 'slaves cannot breathe' thereon. They next purified their colonies from the stain of slavery. Their principles now compel them, before they can call upon other sovereign people for immediate emancipation, first to practise immediate emancipation themselves by abolishing the apprenticeship. Mr. President, are there no apprentices around you? Are there not five hundred thousand apprentices to liberty, not for one year or six years, but for a time not yet defined, scattered throughout this and other states in which abolitionism almost reigns? How then can we co-operate with Great Britain how can we emulate her example, unless we abolish the last vestiges of slavery in our own states, before we send our remonstrances to other sovereign states? Or, how can we call upon the South for immediate and entire emancipation, whilst we permit gradual emancipation in the North? It may be said, sir, that this society is pursuing the great general object of the emancipation of all the slaves, and that when this is obtained, the elevation of the colored people of the North will follow of course. Sir, it was a similar train of reasoning and of conduct that has entailed upon the American people the necessity of forming an American Anti-Slavery Society. Our ancestors for they were mine as well as yours fought for and obtained the precious boon of republican liberty of equal rights but they omitted to extend the same to those who had been slaves at the South, believing that the great object being obtained for all, liberty would as a matter of course be given to these unfortunate bondmen. Sir, we now behold the consequences of that omission. Let us beware of following so disastrous a precedent, else we will entail on the present generation, or those who may come after us, the necessity of a still more radical anti-slavery movement. Let us then, sir, thoroughly do the work. Let us begin at home. Let us first purify our own soil, and then may we call upon the South to follow the example. An eloquent gentleman who addressed you this morning observed, that if the whole moral and intellectual power of the North be brought to bear upon the South, it must accomplish the abolition of slavery. Sir, the North cannot collect nor concentrate its moral and intellectual power whilst there is slavery in the North for semi-emancipation is slavery still and it is my firm belief, a belief which springs from the deepest and strongest conviction, that that which will tell most, and do most toward the abolition of southern slavery, will be the sight of freed colored men, elevated in these northern white communities to the dignities and privileges of citizens of the republic.    Homo sum humani nil alienum a ma puto                    

    To the Editor of the Liberator.  DEAR SIR I perceive by the notice given by the N.F.A.S. Convention, that there is no mention of a meeting to be held any evening this week. I trust such is not the intention of the directors of the meeting. If the fear of a mob is the cause, better that the Free Church should be converted into its original state, a Stable. I trust and hope that I am mistaken in regard to the movements of the party. If not, I shall be disappointed, in common with many other young men of this city.  Free Church    JEFFERSON.   'JEFFERSON' should have clearly perceived, ere this, that abolitionists, whether in Boston or elsewhere, are not the men, ay, or the women, to be deterred from holding their meetings, either in the day-time or evening, by 'the fear of a mob.' It is the mob who fear them, not they the mob. The only reason why the Convention holds no public meeting this (Wednesday) evening, or to-morrow (Thursday) evening, is, because it can obtain no other suitable building than the Marlboro' Chapel in this city; and as the Chapel is to be occupied those evenings by other societies, the Convention, of course, cannot use it. On Friday, however, during the day and evening, we believe it is the design of the Convention to hold public meetings in the Chapel, which will then be at their service. Due notice will be given of the arrangement. Efforts were made, long before the Chapel was completed, to secure it three days successively of the present week, for the N.E. Convention; but as so many other benevolent and religious associations wished to occupy it during the same period, the managers of the Chapel declined granting the request. This explanation will, we presume, satisfy our correspondent whether he be an abolitionist, jealous lest some concession shall be made to mobocracy, or an enemy, eager to excite tumult, on ascertaining when a favorable opportunity will present itself for so doing.    

               Delivered at a great meeting of the citizens of Alton, a few days before his death   We have seen two notices of this speech one in a letter from the Alton correspondent of the Cincinnati Journal, and one in the Memoir of Lovejoy. They are both extremely affecting, but it is confessed, furnish only a faint idea of the character of the speech as delivered. We rejoice that President Beecher has given a full report of this remarkable speech. He states that Mr. Lovejoy, at his request, immediately after the meeting, wrote down all that he could recall of it, and he (Pres. Beecher) from memory added the rest. It will be recollected, that the meeting was composed of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of Alton ministers, merchants, civilians, politicians and also of the lawless part of the community.The Committee appointed to prepare a set of compromise-resolutions as they were called, performed their task in such a way as to concede every thing to the mob, and demand from Mr. Lovejoy the surrender of the liberty of the press, of which at this crisis he was the appointed sentinel. We give what follows in the language of Dr. Beecher. The speech of Mr. Lovejoy is, with one or two exceptions, a model of eloquence; we never read one that affected us more deeply; it deserves to be printed in letters of gold. We cannot but think, that if it were circulated every where throughout the nation, it would do more to win respect and admiration for Mr. Lovejoy's character, than all that has been written about him.'As Mr. Lovejoy arose to reply,' says Mr. Beecher, 'I watched his countenance with deep interest, not to say anxiety; I saw no tokens of disturbance. With a tranquil, self-possessed air, he went up to the bar in which the chairman sat, and in a tone of deep, tender and subdued feeling, spoke as follows:           'I feel, Mr. Chairman, that this is the most solemn moment of my life. I feel, I trust, in some measure, the responsibilities which at this hour I sustain to these my fellow-citizens, to the church of which I am a minister, to my country and to God. And let me beg of you, before I proceed farther, to construe nothing I shall say as being disrespectful to this assembly; I have no such feeling far from it; and if I do not act or speak according to their wishes at all times, it is because I cannot conscientiously do it. It is proper I should state the whole matter as I understand it before this audience. I do not stand here to argue the question as presented by the report of the committee. My only wonder is, how the Hon. gentleman,* the chairman of that committee, for whose character I entertain great respect, though I have not the pleasure of his personal acquaintance, my only wonder is how that gentleman could have brought himself to submit such a report.'Mr. Chairman, I do not admit that it is the business of this assembly to decide whether I shall, or shall not, publish a newspaper in this city. The gentlemen have, as the lawyers say, made a wrong issue. I have the right to do it. I know that I have the right freely to speak and publish my sentiments, subject only to the laws of the land for the abuse of that right. This right was given me by my Maker, and is solemnly guarantied to me by the Constitution of these United States, and of this State. What I wish to know of you is, whether you will protect me in the exercise of this right, or whether, as heretofore, I am to be subjected to personal indignity and outrage. These resolutions, and the measures proposed by them, are spoken of as a compromise; a compromise between two parties. Mr. Chairman, this is not so; there is but one party here. It is simply a question whether the law shall be enforced, or whether the mob shall be allowed, as they now do, to continue to trample it under their feet, by violating with impunity the rights of an innocent individual. Mr. Chairman, what have I to compromise? If freely to forgive those who have so greatly injured me; if to pray for their temporal and eternal happiness; if still to wish for the prosperity of your city and state, notwithstanding all the indignities I have suffered in it; if this be the compromise intended, then do I willingly make it. My rights have been shamefully, wickedly outraged; this I know, and feel, and can never forget; but I can and do freely forgive those who have done it.'But if by a compromise be meant, that I should cease from doing that which duty requires of me, I cannot make it. And the reason is, that I fear God more than I fear man. Think not that I would lightly go contrary to public sentiment around me. The good opinion of my fellow-men is dear to me, and I would sacrifice any thing but principle to obtain their good wishes; but when they ask me to surrender this, they ask for more than I can than I dare give. Reference is made to the fact, that I offered, a few days since, to yield up the editorship of the 'Observer' into other hands. This is true, I did so; because it was thought, or said by some, that perhaps the paper would be better patronized in other hands. They declined accepting my offer, however and since then we have heard from the friends and supporters of the paper in all parts of the state. There was but one sentiment among them, and this was, that the paper could be sustained in no other hands than mine. It is also a very different question, whether I shall voluntarily, or at the request of friends, yield up my post, or whether I shall forsake it at the demand of a mob. The former I am at all times ready to do, when circumstances seem to require it, as I will never put my personal wishes or interests in competition with the cause of that Master whose minister I am; but the latter, be assured, I NEVER WILL DO. God in his providence, so say all my brethren, and so I think has devolved upon me the responsibility of maintaining my ground here; and, Mr. Chairman, I am determined to do it. A voice comes to me from Maine, from Massachusetts, from Connecticut, from New York, from Pennsylvania; yea from Kentucky, from Mississippi, from Missouri, calling upon me in the name of all that is dear to heaven or earth, to stand fast; and by the help of God, I WILL STAND. I know I am but one, and you are many. My strength would avail but little against you all: you can crush me if you will, but I shall die at my post, for I cannot and will not forsake it. Why should I flee from Alton? Is not this a free state? When assailed by a mob in St. Louis, I came here as to the home of freedom and of the laws. The mob have pursued me here, and why should I retreat again? Where can I be safe if not here? Have I not a right to claim the protection of the laws? and what more can I have in any other place? Sir, the very act of retreating will embolden the mob to follow me wherever I go. No, Sir, there is no way to escape the mob, but to abandon the path of duty, and that, God helping me, I will never do.'It has been said here, that my hand is against every man, and every man's hand against me. The last part of the declaration is too painfully true. I do indeed find almost every hand lifted against me, but against whom in this place has my hand been raised? I appeal to every individual present; whom of you have I injured? whose character have I traduced? whose family have I molested? whose business have I meddled with? If any, let him rise here and testify against me. ----- No one answers.'And do not your resolutions say that you find nothing against my private or personal character? And does any one believe that if there was any thing to be found, it would not be found and brought forth? If in any thing I have offended against the law, I am not so popular in this community as that it would be difficult to convict me. You have courts and judges, and juries; they find nothing against me, and now you have come together for the purpose of driving out a confessedly innocent man, for no cause but that he dares to think and speak as his conscience and his God dictate. Will conduct like this stand the scrutiny of your country, of posterity, above all, of the Judgment Day? For remember, the Judge of that day is no respecter of persons.'Pause, I beseech you, and reflect. The present excitement will soon be over; the voice of conscience will at last be heard; and in some season of honest thought, even in this world, as you review the scenes of this hour, you will be compelled to say, 'he was right he was right.''But you have been exhorted to be lenient and compassionate, and in driving me away, to affix no unnecessary disgrace upon me. Sir, I reject all such compassion. You cannot disgrace me. Scandal, falsehood and calumny have already done their worst. My shoulders have borne the burden till it sits easy upon them. You may hang me up as the mob hung up the individuals at Vicksburg: you may burn me at the stake as they did McIntosh at St. Louis: you may tar and feather me, or throw me into the Mississippi, as you have often threatened to do; but you cannot disgrace me. I, and I alone can disgrace myself, and the deepest of all disgrace would be, at a time like this, to deny my Master by forsaking his cause. He died for me, and I were most unworthy to bear his name, should I refuse, if need be, to die for him.'Again, you have been told that I have a family who are dependent on me, and this has been given as a reason why I should be driven off as gently as possible. It is true, Mr. Chairman, I am a husband and a father, and this it is that adds the bitterest ingredient to the cup of sorrow I am called to drink. I am made to feel the wisdom of the Apostle's advice, 'it is better not to marry.' I know, Sir, that in this contest, I stake not my life only, but that of others also. I do not expect my wife will ever recover from the shock received at the awful scenes through which she was called to pass at St. Charles. And how was it the other night on my return to my home? I found her driven into the garret through fear of the mob, who were prowling round my house. And scarcely had I entered the house, ere my windows were broken by the brick-bats of the mob, and she so alarmed as rendered it impossible for her to sleep or rest that night. I am hunted as a partridge on the mountain. I am pursued as a felon through your streets; to the guardian power of the law I look in vain for that protection against violence, which even the vilest criminal may enjoy. Yet think not that I am unhappy. Think not that I regret the choice that I have made. While all around me is violence and tumult, all is peace within. An approving conscience and the rewarding smile of God, are a full recompense for all that I forego, and all that I endure. Yes, Sir, I enjoy a peace which nothing can destroy. I sleep sweetly and undisturbed, except when awakened by the brick-bats of the mob.'No, sir, I am not unhappy; I have counted the cost, and stand prepared freely to offer up my all in the service of God. Yes, sir, I am fully aware of all the sacrifice I make, in here pledging myself to continue this contest to the last. (Forgive these tears; I had not intended to shed them, and they flow not for myself but for others.) But I am commanded to forsake father and mother, and wife and children, for Jesus' sake, and as his professed disciple, I stand pledged to do it. The time for fulfilling this pledge in my case, it seems to me, has come. Sir, I dare not flee away from Alton: should I attempt it, I should feel that the angel of the Lord with his flaming sword was pursuing me wherever I went. It is because I fear God, that I am not afraid of all those who oppose me in this city. No, sir, the contest has commenced here, and here it must be finished. Before God and you all, I here pledge myself to continue it, if need be, till death; and if I fall, my grave shall be made in Alton.'With reference to this manly and affecting speech which never was surpassed in the 'times that tried men's souls' by any effort of James Otis, or Samuel Adams, or Patrick Henry President Beecher remarks:'I have been affected often times with the power of intellect and eloquence, but never was I so overcome as at this hour. He made no display there was no rhetorical decoration no violence of action. All was native truth, and deep, pure and tender feeling. Many a hard face did I see, wet with tears, as he struck the cords of feeling, to which God made the soul to respond. Even his bitter enemies wept; as for me, I could not endure it. I laid down my head, and gave way to my feelings without control. When he had closed, I could not doubt that the whole audience was convinced that he was right, and that if the authors of the report would have said so, and exhorted to defend him, it would have carried the whole audience with electric power.'    right     me                  * Hon. Cyrus Edwards, Senator from Madison Co., and whig candidate for Governor.    

 TO BE REMEMBERED. 'If ye were of the world,' said Jesus to his disciples, 'the world would love his own.' The persecution which abolitionists are receiving at the hands of the violent, the drunken, the profane, the ungodly, throughout this blood-stained land, whenever they lift up the voice of warning and supplication in behalf of the oppressed, is demonstrative proof that they are actuated by a spirit with which a dark and rebellious world have no affinity. 'Remember the world that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.'Take another test. It cannot be denied, that all that is lawless, oppressive, unprincipled, licentious and murderous, is arrayed in deadly hostility to the persons and property, the principles and measures of the abolitionists. It is not less certain that abolitionists, as a body their enemies being judges are conspicuous for their peaceable behaviour, their zeal in every good enterprise, their lowliness of mind, their willingness to suffer rather than do wrong, their regard for the rights of all men, their uncompromising opposition to every popular vice. Who are the most fearless, consistent, unwavering friends of the Temperance cause, if not the abolitionists? Who are doing so much, both theoretically and practically to advance the cause of Peace, as themselves? Who feel a deeper interest in the purification of the land from the pollution of licentiousness? Who are better neighbors or citizens better husbands or wives better moralists or christians? Who are more ready to relieve the poor and needy, to succor the on cost, to bind up the broken-hearted, to condescend to men of low estate, to engage in every benevolent and holy enterprise? Who hold up the precepts and examples of Jesus Christ more constantly than they? Who are hated, like themselves, for refusing to be respecters of persons, for rejoicing in the fact that God has made of one blood all nations of men, for denouncing the heathenish spirit of caste? Say we these things exultingly? God forbid. But, being true, what shall be said of their revilers and persecutors? Most certainly, the wrath which is visited upon the heads of abolitionists, is not all excited by a knowledge of the fact that they are the enemies of slavery. No. It is because they are known to set their faces like a flint against war, intemperance, lewdness, profanity, and immorality of every kind, that vial after vial of 'public indignation' is poured out upon them, seeing they are determined to give the sins of this nation no rest, and to pronounce a woe upon all who are at 'ease in Zion.'       

            The 'gentlemen of property and standing' in Philadelphia have succeeded in reducing the character of that city to the level of some of her neighboring cities, by the destruction of the Pennsylvania Hall, under the eyes of the civil authority, and if not with their connivance, certainly without any efficient attempts on their part to prevent it. If we could persuade ourselves to believe, that the spirit which has excited, and attempted indirectly to justify, the riots which have disgraced several of our cities within the last five years, was the prevalent one of the country, we should, indeed, consider the days of free institutions, in this land, as nearly numbered. For, it is very certain, from the evidence of all history, and from the very nature of the case itself, that, when existing institutions fail to protect the people in their persons and properties, they will resort to others, which will secure that grand object of all political organization. If, though retaining the name of liberty, the spirit the extinct; if the form of free government be made but the cloak of tyranny; the desire will not long continue, to retain that which has failed to accomplish the object of its institution. If the definition given by the Reverend Hubbard Winslow, in his thanksgiving sermon, is to prevail, that 'republican liberty is, to do that which the prevailing voice of the brotherhood will allow and protect,' and if 'the brotherhood' are to be exhorted and instructed to 'allow and protect' only such things as conform to their views of expediency, then is Russian despotism, or almost any other despotism, preferable to 'republican liberty.' The very worst despotism that can be imagined, is the despotism of anarchy the despotism of a lawless mob; and where this long prevails, people will enlist themselves under the banner of any leader who holds out a fair prospect of releasing them from it, however arbitrary or tyrannical his character may be.But we are not yet prepared to believe that the spirit, which has thus manifested itself in the cities, is the prevailing one of the country. On the contrary, we have found it shrinking under the withering rebuke, which it has received from the less contaminated portions of the community, whenever it has been manifested in such outrageous acts. Thus, in Boston, where a few inoffensive women were mobbed, when peaceably, quietly, and unostentatiously assembled for a legal and constitutional purpose, the rebuke following that act has produced such a change, that large meetings of all classes of citizens are now allowed to meet and discuss the same question in the most public manner possible, and even the hall of legislation is thrown open to them for that purpose. In Utica, too, where a convention was broken up and driven from the city, some of the most prominent citizens taking part in the act, such a reaction has taken place, that those, who were sustained by the popular voice, in riding, roughshod, over the rights of their fellow citizens, now find themselves in a meagre and contemptible minority. So, too, it is in other places, and so, we firmly believe, it will soon be in Philadelphia. The 'City of Brotherly Love' will not be content long to remain in her present disgraced and humbled condition. She will not be satisfied to continue a hissing and a by-word throughout the land a mark for the moral finger of the whole community to be pointed at.In the mean time, the friends of liberty and of free discussion have a solemn duty to perform. Let them sustain the proprietors of the hall in enforcing their claim for the destruction of their property, and let them forthwith take measures for raising a new hall, Phoenix-like, on the ruins of the last, before its ashes are yet cold a hall, like that, sacred to the principles of liberty, and sacred to a 'free discussion of all questions, not of an immoral tendency.' Mass. Spy.  will liberty, form Reverend      Mass. Spy.   

 HOW TO STOP 'AGITATION'! First, be inflamed to personal madness against the advocates of liberty; then get as many lawless madmen to join in a riotous assault upon them as money and rum can purchase; then, under cover of night, make an attack with brick-bats and deadly weapons upon a peaceable assembly of men and women, whose principles forbid them to return evil for evil; then set fire to the building in which they had congregated, and consume it to ashes, under the shelter of the city authorities; then apply the torch to an asylum for orphan children; then make an assault upon the private dwellings of the most exemplary followers of William Penn; then demolish the windows, &c. &c. of certain meeting-houses; then attempt to destroy certain printing-offices, for daring to maintain the liberty of the press; and, finally, vex the pure atmosphere with profane and polluting words, startle the dull ear of night with frantic yells and howlings, and trample under foot, for the space of five days, all law and order, all fear of God and regard for man calumniate the good, abuse the innocent, threaten the weak, assail the defenceless, and multiply slanders and falsehoods 'as the sands upon the sea-shore, innumerable.' This is the modern recipe to allay excitement, discovered and administered by the friends of American slavery and of African colonization! What calm philosophers! what wise contrivers! what profound geniuses! Is this indeed the mode to stop all agitation of the subject of slavery? Why, the infamous and terrific transactions, above alluded to, will in one month make more excitement, and create more discussion, throughout the land, than a host of anti-slavery lecturers could do in half-a-dozen years! They will furnish a fruitful theme for each of the fifteen hundred newspapers in the republic; they are setting in motion ten millions of tongues on this continent, and will move twice ten millions in Europe; from the child of six years, to the grey-haired sire of eighty, in every city, town, village and hamlet, they are the grand topic of conversation and inquiry; the mails are destined to groan with letters and publications, giving details of these dastardly outrages; fifteen hundred anti-slavery societies will be quickened to newness of life by their commission; a thousand pulpits will speak out in thunder-tones against that system of lynch-law, slavery, in consequence of these things; and mighty and indescribable is to be the 'agitation' growing out of this 'fanatical' attempt of colonization persecutors and slaveholding tyrants, to put down 'agitation'! Rejoice, then, friends of humanity, advocates of the oppressed, seeing that the crafty are taken in their own craftiness, and the counsels of the forward are carried headlong! If our God is causing even the wrath of his enemies to praise him, shall we not cry, 'Alleluia?'      

       Since our last, a riot of a most infamous character has occurred in Philadelphia, which resulted in the wanton, unresisted, and deliberate destruction by a mob of a large and expensive public building, erected for public lectures and free discussion. The papers say that of the many thousands, who crowded in the vicinity to witness the conflagration of this beautiful edifice, the larger part were 'respectable and well dressed persons, who evidently looked on with approbation.' Can it be so? Has human nature sunk so low? Are all the great moral distinctions so obliterated in our minds, that we can perceive no longer a difference between order and anarchy, between justice and injustice, between liberty and licentiousness, between humanity and cruelty? Are all generous and just affections so paralyzed within us; have avarice and tyranny so fixed their gangrene in our souls, that all sentiment of liberty and honor has become extinct within us? Has divine Providence, in its awful and just retribution, sealed the fate of our Republic, once the glittering pole-star of the friends of liberty throughout the world; so that a moral desolation, as blighting as the Simoon of the African desert, has come over us; and human passions, defying all the restraints of government, of reason, of religion, are suffered to run riot like devils incarnate; and the terrific scenes of the French Revolution are to be acted over in our young community? Do not men see, where mob violence is suffered to prevail, all law is at an end; and no man's property, or house, or person, or life, is secure a moment.But it is our province only to give facts yet it seems as though our pen would drop from our hands while we trace these facts. The glare of this conflagration flashes before our disturbed vision, as though the flames of Hell itself had burst up through the earth for where else indeed could such fires have been kindled?The Hall was dedicated to free discussion, excluding only subjects of an immoral character. The Hall was dedicated to 'VIRTUE, LIBERTY, and INDEPENDENCE.' The sole objects of the particular meetings holden in it on this occasion were the discussion of the great principles of civil and universal liberty, and of universal justice and love. This was not to be tolerated, and yet this was the whole of the offence. Yet in a country calling itself the only free country in the world, the rights of speech and the press are to be trampled under foot, and the cause of freedom shall not even be discussed.It is said that when the roof of this noble temple of liberty fell in, there was a universal shout of triumph. Strange that such a shout in such a city should not at once have called the spirits of Franklin and Rush from their graves. Some of the public buildings and squares in this beautiful city, are adorned with the statues of these noble sons of liberty, these friends of universal humanity. Let the next efforts of the Philadelphians be to melt down these statues, which heretofore they have pointed at with pride; and let them replace them at once with the appropriate statues of Nero, Caligula, Danton and Robespierre.We understand that the afterpiece intended to follow the first performance was an attempt to set fire to the asylum for orphan colored children. Good Heavens! has all humanity fled the earth? Why had not these true savages, these 'respectable and well dressed' cannibals, have brought these miserable children into their State House yard; and having transfixed them with pine splinters, have burnt them in the true Indian style? It certainly would have been good enough for such wretches as choose to offend a Christian community by being guilty of wearing a black skin. New-England Farmer.          New-England Farmer.   

 We intended to continue our own sketch of the riotous proceedings in Philadelphia, as witnessed by us but, in making room for the indignant responses of the public press, and the communications of H.C.W. on this subject, we are driven into narrow limits.     

 THE 'CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE.' We had flattered ourselves that the day of abolition mobs had gone by that the rabble had become sane enough to know that their lawless violence only served to build up a set of opinions which they were endeavoring to put down. But it seems that Philadelphia the far-famed city of brotherly love must have her turn with these frantic orgies. The recent riot and arson committed at that place appears to have been the work of cold blood. Men had banded together in the different wards for the express purpose of disturbing the public peace, and setting the authority of law at open defiance. We are therefore not to look upon it in the light of such a mob, as that which, in a paroxysm of sudden indignation at fancied wrongs, destroyed the Ursuline Nunnery at Mount Benedict, but in the worse light of a savage, brutal, premeditated, diabolical outrage upon the rights of others. The destruction of property was the more wanton, because it was committed after the concession had been made by the abolitionists, of giving up the key of the building into the hands of the mayor.The statement of this affair in another part of this paper (copied from the Philadelphia papers) we have reason to believe, from information received of persons who were on the ground, is essentially erroneous; particularly that part of it which states that 'whites and blacks, arm-in-arm, were thronging the streets in scores.' This story was spread through the city in order to inflame the angry passions of the multitude, and then used by the newspapers in order to give a color of reason to this most diabolical outrage.It is not a little singular that the first building erected in this free country, and under the guardian eye of our free and equal laws, for the express purpose of free discussion, and solemnly dedicated to that, which forms the very corner stone to our great fabric of liberty and equality, should have been demolished by that most intolerable and irresponsible of all despotisms, the sovereign mob! But, startling as it is to every real lover of liberty, such is the naked truth. It may be urged that public opinion is the supreme law; but that kind of public opinion which denies to the minority those rights solemnly guaranteed by the Constitution, is nothing more nor less than a despotism. It destroys at once all protection to life or property, and renders men amenable not to the right, but to the law of the strongest. Constitutions are formed for the express purpose of protecting the weak, because the strongest can take care of themselves. Boston Times.      color   free mob! Boston Times.   

       The undersigned ask the attention of their fellow-citizens to the following statement. They are authorized to make it in behalf of one hundred and twenty-four legal voters of the city of Boston, who presented a petition to the Mayor and Aldermen on the 14th inst., praying the use of Faneuil Hall, for the purpose of holding therein on the 31st of May, at 2 o'clock, P.M. a public meeting of citizens in favor of the immediate abolition of slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia.On the 14th inst. this petition was laid on the table. But, after earnest request on our part, it was taken up at the meeting of the Board on the 21st inst., and rejected.On the 26th, the undersigned addressed a communication to the Board, of which the following is a copy:         BOSTON, May 25, 1838.     To the Mayor and Aldermen: To the Mayor and Aldermen  GENTLEMEN The undersigned have been authorized to act as a committee of one hundred and twenty-four legal voters of the city of Boston, who recently petitioned for the use of Faneuil Hall, for the purpose of holding therein, on the 31st inst., a meeting of those opposed to slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia.    The petition in question was rejected by your Board on Monday last.  The object of our efforts has been approved by solemn votes of the last legislature of this Commonwealth, passed with unexampled unanimity; and the petitioners are unwilling to acquiesce, silently and at once, in the summary rejection of their petition, lest it might appear, (what they trust is not the case,) that in their attempts to purify the capital of our common country from slavery, they are without the sympathy and good wishes of the municipal authorities of this moral and free city.The undersigned are now directed to solicit a re-consideration and reversal of the decision of your Board; or, in case this should not be granted, most respectfully to request your Board to state the grounds on which the petitioners are denied a privilege so usually accorded to any respectable body of men, having a common public object.This application came before the Board at its meeting yesterday afternoon, and was laid on the table; that is, virtually rejected.In glancing over the Records of the Board of Aldermen, for the last eighteen months, we find there have been, besides our own, fifteen applications for the use of Faneuil Hall, coming from men of the most various opinions, and with comparatively unimportant objects. Fourteen of these have been promptly granted. One only was rejected. Need we say, that this was the petition of WM. ELLERY CHANNING and others, for a meeting to commemorate suitably the outrage on life, order and freedom, at Alton? The Board, however, even in that case, vouchsafed to the petitioners their reasons for the refusal reasons which will, we doubt not, be long remembered by our fellow-citizens; and in less than a week after, the Hall was opened for the same purpose, 'the circumstances,' as the Board remarked at the time, 'being materially different.'We learn that individual members of the Board have stated, in private conversation, that our petition for the Hall on the 31st inst. was rejected in consequence of its being engaged for the dinner of the Medical Society. One word will be a sufficient reply to this. The dinner of the Medical Society takes place on Wednesday, while our application was for Thursday afternoon. We may add, that we have received, in answer to our inquiries, a communication from the person who has been employed, for several years past, in putting up the tables for public dinners in Faneuil Hall, in which he writes that the Hall may be readily cleared of the tables in half a day, and in much less time if required; and that the expense of putting up and removing them would not exceed ten dollars.Fellow citizens, would Faneuil Hall, in similar circumstances, have been refused to either of the powerful political parties in our city?We are not unaware, that the Board of Aldermen are entrusted with a discretionary power over Faneuil Hall; but this discretion was not given them to be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously, but impartially and on principle. It was not intended to invest them with a censorship over opinions, or to enable them to stigmatize, by invidious distinctions or contemptuous treatment, any class of their fellow-citizens. We have, indeed, been cheered by the countenance of the State. The Legislature has twice opened the State-house to us. But the Cradle of Liberty, though rocked two years since by the apologists for slavery, has never yet been allowed to pass, for one hour, into the hands of the friends of universal freedom. We are not allowed to be heard on that sacred spot. Are we to believe, as is sometimes intimated, that our city government really stands in terror of a mob? or is it feared that, if heard, we may convince? Is it that        reasons     in half a day putting up and removing        'Men grow pale,Lest their own judgments should become too bright;And their free thoughts be crimes; and earth have too much light?    We feel it to be our duty to the cause we represent, and to the community in which we live, not to let these facts pass in silence. It is the more necessary we should speak out, inasmuch as all notice of our petition and its rejection is suppressed in the usual newspaper report of the doings of the Board.Fellow citizens, we have come reluctantly to the apprehension, that there is not in our municipal Rulers, due solicitude to measure out equal justice to such as hold our unpopular sentiments. We have, in vain, most respectfully asked to know why we are not to be treated like other citizens. We are now driven to this appeal. Do not, however, understand us as asking any thing at your hands. Our only wish is, to have it precisely understood, for the sake of others far more than ourselves, how we are habitually treated. The privilege of occupying Faneuil Hall may not, of itself, be an important one; but it is important that, both in great and small things, our rulers should guard equally the rights of all.

 It is somewhat curious to observe the tone of the political presses those daring conservators of liberty and the rights of man relative to the late outrage at Philadelphia. Most of them (we believe there are a few honorable exceptions) profess to deprecate not only this outrage, but all mob violence whatever; yet they couple their stricture with a 'but' and an 'if,' which the quick-sighted eye of the rabble, ever ready to catch the least token of approbation, immediately translates in its most significant sense. All the mob ask for, is a qualified censure of their works: and those inuendos, which they know are full of meaning, will repair all damage to their consciences. The proper way for the public press, if it intends to exert a healthful influence upon the public mind and morals, is to condemn unqualifiedly every outrage upon the public peace, from whatever source or whatever occasion it may proceed. One mob is just as good as another; for the occasion of it, whether good or bad, does not enter into the account at all. Every mob, no matter what its object or its cause, is totally and entirely execrable; and every mobocrat he alike who acts, or who justifies the outrage is deserving of both the pillory and the State Prison. His offence is aggravated by the fact that he seeks to injure others without benefitting himself. The poor horse thief hopes to reap a personal advantage from the theft he commits, but the mob cannot plead this justification, or even the necessities of the case. His acts are therefore more than criminal they are diabolical. Ibid.   Ibid.   

 The foregoing Appeal speaks for itself. The facts which it discloses are certainly disgraceful to the city authorities, both as it respects the rejection of the petition, and the treatment of the petitioners; and they prove the overshadowing influence of slavery among us. How contemptible is that spirit which excludes from the newspaper report of the doings of the Board, all notice of the petition above referred to! We do not think it important to enquire, who is responsible for the omission; but we cannot suppose it altogether undesigned. Not an order for paving a street or laying a drain can be passed, without its appearing punctually in the published proceedings of the Board; while all notice of the reception, the laying on the table, and the subsequent rejection of our petition, belonging as it does to an object, which lies at the very heart of the people of this Commonwealth an object for which sixty or eighty thousand of her citizens are petitioning Congress, and to which her Legislature has repeatedly set the seal of its approbation, is dropt out of the printed record of the Board, as too insignificant for notice!     

 It was with some surprise, that we heard two or three respectable merchants considered such by themselves and others on the arrival of the news of the mob at Philadelphia, openly, in a public reading room, express their approbation at such riotous proceedings, and declare they were glad the building was burned. When men of large property and high standing give utterance to such feelings as these, it is high time to look around them, and contemplate the tendency and the inevitable result of their doctrines. It is such men as these who have the greatest stake in the preservation of order and law. Think they the rabble will be sated by a single victim? Think they that when the time for a general 'division of property' comes, as come it surely must, if things go on at the present rate, their property will be spared amidst the general wreck? Alas, they greatly mistake the nature of the mob. The 'gaunt wolf,' who, after having obtained a taste of human flesh, harbors thereafter an insatiable appetite for the same kind of food, is not more insatiable than the mob which has had one taste of plunder. For our own part, we have little to lose by a mob; but we have always advocated to the best of our ability the majesty of the laws. When, however, the sword of violence and mob empiricism shall have fairly leaped from its scabbard to waste and to destroy, our efforts shall not be wanting to give the merchants, to whom we have alluded, their full share of the bitter fruits. Let those who sow the wind have a care for the whirlwind. Ibid.    Ibid.   

 A serious attempt was made in this city on Thursday of last week, to get up a mob to attack the Marlboro' Chapel during the delivery of the dedicatory sermon that evening. Placards were posted in various parts of the city, calling for a riotous assemblage. Accordingly, thousands of persons assembled in front of the building in the evening a very large portion, doubtless, drawn thither by motives of curiosity. There was a good deal of yelling, but no violence was done, owing to the disheartening fact, that the Mayor had ordered four light infantry companies to be in readiness with 100 ball cartridges each, at the tolling of the bells, to put down the rioters. Several persons were arrested by the police officers, and the next day sentenced to pay fines for their misconduct. Had it not been for the energetic conduct of the Mayor, there is no doubt that the Chapel would have been seriously damaged, if not destroyed.   ball   

 How long the saturnalia of the Torch and Club are to last, remains to be seen. Riot the third took place last night. Hands that strike in dark care not for size or color of victims, and so a mob attacked an asylum for orphan children, under the charge of some benevolent ladies (neither politicians nor abolitionists) and set it on fire. It is a large new building in the northern part of the city, but the children (little black sinners) and their protectors, had not yet occupied it. The alarm being immediately given, the police and firemen were soon in attendance, and extinguished the flames, with creditable promptitude. Heaven knows what is to come next. We would sooner run our chance with a menagerie let loose than a mob. The one has ferocity tempered with nobleness and sagacity, and operates only with teeth and claws, and can eat its fill. The other is blindly cruel and systematically noxious; its means of harm are indefinite, and its appetite insatiable. Those who wink at a first outburst of popular violence, have often to mourn at a second.The justice of a mob is not troubled with forms, ceremonies or quibbles. It is at once judge, jury and executioner. Whether we are to be again visited with its promptitude and energy is unknown. At present, we have the evidences of our eyes that it flourishes capriciously in place of legitimate law, and if we doubted the fact, we have the opinion of the Bench to substantiate it. Philad.

              MY BROTHER:  I sent you an account of the state of this city up to 4 o'clock, p.m. Friday, May [ ]. After that date to the present time, the following are some of the proceedings. A large crowd of the mobocratic merchants, mechanics, and laborers, urged on and inflamed by the slaveholders now in the city, had been stationed near the Hall during all Friday. About sunset, thousands began to collect from all parts of the city, stimulated by rum, southern kidnappers, and colonizationists, prepared to go wherever the spirit of Slavery and Colonization should direct, and to do whatever works of plunder and death it should dictate. After a time, in the evening of Friday, a rush was made to a school house belonging to Jacob Pierce, in Cherry street. In this building, the Convention of Women had met during the day. Of this fact, the mob were aware; but from ignorance, or some other cause, they missed the house.The mob rushed on, and, probably through mistake, hurled stones at Wetherel's Factory. They also stoned Grace Church. They then surrounded the house of Edward Needles, corner of Twelfth and Race. There they howled and roared for half an hour the inmates of the house sitting within, calm and collected, putting their trust in God. That noble woman, emphatically the friend of the oppressed, Mary Needles, had set out her table, and covered it with food, to feed her cruel enemies, should they burst into the house. Merchants of Market street were said to be in the mob, exciting their fury against Edward Needles, because he befriended the friendless. The cry was, that there were colored people and amalgamators lodged in the house; but no injury was done to the house or its inmates, though the infuriated mob raved and roared without, several thousands, like the roaring of many waters.After a time, the mob started for the 'Shelter for Colored Orphans,' near by a new building, not yet occupied. This they fired and burnt partly down, when the firemen appeared, and extinguished the fire. Colonization, as advocated by Elliot Cresson, and that man who tells us he is exiled (for what?) from his native land, Dr. Sleigh, are determined that these dear outcast orphans shall have no shelter here. Then the mob started away, passed down by Edward and Mary Needle's. As they passed, it is said that a custom house officer tore down one of the signs of Edward Needles. Without further particulars thus a mob of thousands, unawed and uncontrolled by the opposition of moral or physical power, went up and down the city, working their will during the night, though I cannot learn that any further damage was done to property or life on Friday night. The moral cowardice of the peace men of the city was no less conspicuous than the recreant meanness of the Mayor and his posse.During the forenoon of this day, Saturday, groups have been collected in various places, plotting destruction to public and private buildings. Our friends, James Mott and Edward Needles, were particularly obnoxious, owing to their firm and noble stand in favor of humanity and liberty. Again, I repeat, the civil authorities of this city may be termed the mob the mayor, JOHN SWIFT, the king of mobocrats. They had sworn to protect the citizens and the city. This they might have done, without a resort to arms. The moment any symptom of a mob appeared, had the mayor and his posse, with a sufficient number of friends, stood forth all clad in robes of peace, and armed with the resistless power and energy of high moral daring, that hall had been now standing, and this city had not been for three days and nights under the control of a drunken, infuriated mob. The blood-thirsty kidnappers of the South would have cowered before them. The menstealers of the South, armed with bowie-knife and pistol, in their moral degradation and meanness, would have quailed before the majesty of truth and forgiveness, and the dignity and noble moral daring of their stern rebukers. But the mayor and his posse did no such thing. Are they not perjured? John Swift demanded the key of the hall. The key was given to him. He promised to protect the hall. How did he redeem his promise? He made a courteous speech to the mob, for which they cheered him; he gracefully bowed to Slavery and Colonization, bid the mob farewell for the night, and then the mob went at the work of destruction, assuring one another that the mayor was on their side, and hated the abolitionists as much as they did. The mayor was recreant to his oath of office not that he did not resort to arms, and pour out the life's blood of his fellow citizens like water, but that he used no means to prevent the mob, and no moral resistance to quell it when aroused. I can but think that the burning of that hall, the triumph of mobism. The deliverance of the city into the power of kidnappers and their agents, may be traced to the mayor and his posse, because they might have prevented the mob without bloodshed, but did not. The civil authorities of Philadelphia have appeared to me as the willing tools of southern menstealers and colonizationists, in casting this city into the power of the [ ], and in the destruction of that beautiful hall. The kidnapping ministers and ranters of the South, now in the city, have said southern institutions must not be discussed in Philadelphia. In effect, the city authorities responded, 'No! the abolitionists shall not discuss them in this city. We will burn down their hall first.' No wonder. Is not Col. Johnson, of Va. a slaveholder? Is he not now in this city? Is not the mayor intimately connected with him? Are there not many kidnapping ministers in this city, met in the Old School General Assembly of a kidnapping, manstealing church, with a slaveholder at their head? The wishes of such men are not to be slighted by an unprincipled dough-face and man-pleaser.Human government, based on violence! A magistrate invested with discretionary power over life! Let no man, after this, talk of the protection of the sword. So far from affording protection, I should rather have thrown myself into the hands of the mob, obnoxious as I became to them, than have fallen into the hands of the mayor and the civil authorities of Philadelphia. My peace principles thrice delivered me from the violence of the mob but save me from the grasp of that poor tool of southern despotism, the mayor, especially when guided by the dictation of southern kidnappers! I would fear to ask protection of the civil or military arms, when protection is to be given by butchering my deluded brother. The mob may pour out my blood, and scatter my brains, if they choose; but none shall injure a hair of their heads, if I can help it. For three days and nights this city has been like a raging volcano, rocked and up-heaved as by an earthquake. But thanks to Heaven, while the mayor and civil, or rather uncivil authorities have basely and meanly crawled away into their hiding places while the ministers and christians of every name have skulked away, afraid to suffer and die for the cause of God and his poor and while we have been given over to the pleasure of a furious mob, no moral efforts being made in our behalf the peace of God has been in some hearts. Some have been prepared to die non-resisting. Again I bless God, that none have had, as yet, sufficient brute ferocity and murder to resort to arms to quell the mob.

In him will I trust.'    covered it with food, to feed her cruel enemies   Shelter for Colored Orphans  exiled shelter   prevent moral without bloodshed Old School    based on violence un moral  non-resisting    H.C.W.     

 The only reasons or excuses which, to our knowledge, have been assigned for this riot and outrage, are the two following:First; that at the meetings held in the Hall, the audience were seated without any discrimination as to color, an arrangement, by the way, which is adopted in the services of every Catholic Church in the Union. At least we know that such is the case in the seat of government and in the city of New Orleans;Second; that during Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, divers white and black people were seen, in different parts of the city, walking arm and arm; but this latter fact does not seem to be very well authenticated. We do not see it stated in any of the Philadelphia papers; it comes to us only through the Journal of Commerce and the Commercial Advertiser of New York.Now, whether black people and white shall sit in the same pew, or walk the streets arm in arm, is purely a matter of usage, fashion, or fancy; and if a brutal and ferocious mob, headed by a few boys, and protected in the execution of its purposes by some fifteen or twenty thousand well dressed citizens, is to set itself up as the arbiter of taste and fashion, and burn down houses when people do not conform to its supreme decision, it will not be long before we shall be glad to find refuge against the capricious tyranny of such a tribunal, under a despotic government backed by a standing army. Order, security in person and property against the assaults of the malicious and mischievous, is the first necessity of civilization; and a social system which does not secure this, is good for nothing.A mob, or illegal violence of any kind, under any pretence whatever, is never to be tolerated. This is the first principle of all law, and if this principle be once abandoned, there is no telling where we shall end. Salem Register.           Salem Register.   

        PHILADELPHIA, May 20th, Sunday noon.     MY BROTHER:  Since Saturday, 12 o'clock, the city has continued in the hands of the mob though threats have been more numerous and bloody than deeds. But few on Saturday collected around the Hall that was now a smouldering ruin; but groups collected in various parts of the city, openly laying their plans for the night. The printing-offices of the Ledger and Journal were mobbed, and several private houses of the most conspicuous friends of humanity and equal rights. Threats loud and frequent were made against Edward and Mary Needles. They had been mindful to entertain strangers, colored as well as white Garrison among the rest, and myself whom these mobocrats accuse of calling Washington a manstealer and robber, because he held man, the image of God, as a chattel, an article of merchandize and of being seen walking with my brethren and sisters of a darker skin than my own. At 4, P.M. the firemen and other citizens held a meeting in Independent square. The meeting adjourned without doing any thing, because not called in a manner to suit the whims of the firemen, to meet at 8, P.M. in the same place. They met, and passed some resolutions.Darkness settled on the city. The grogshops, licensed by the city authorities for public good, and gambling hells, the haunts of slaveholders and kidnappers, began to disgorge their inmates. The Ledger office was their first object of attack, because that paper, edited by Jarvis, had fearlessly condemned the doings of the mob and city authorities, together with kidnappers and menstealers. Many collected late in the evening. Not enough being present to make the attack, several of the mob were sent in different directions to bring the scattered forces to a point. Soon thousands came rushing from various quarters to the scene of action. But, from some cause, the mobocrats did not attack the building. They roamed about the city, unmolested, most of the night. It is reported this morning, that they threw stones at several private dwellings, and that several men were killed during the night in Sixth street. They did not attack Edward Needles', nor break open any private dwelling that I can learn. It is said they stoned the Bethel, where our oppressed brethren and sisters worship.The banks were threatened last night. The mayor then began to bestir himself, and to talk of mowing down the mob with grape and cannon shot thus showing his willingness to murder his fellow-men to protect the property of the rich, while he would not incur the displeasure of the mob by bold rebuke and expostulation to extend protection to those generous, noble minded, fearless men and women, who are ready to peril life for the principles of human freedom and for human rights.Yesterday, Judge Todd, of the city, gave a special charge to the Grand Jury. According to his testimony, the city since last Wednesday, has been under the dominion of a mob. 'Our properties, our liberties, and our lives,' he says, 'are no longer secure. We are, it would seem, at the mercy of a mob. (Wonder he did not learn that before.) Our institutions and our laws have been trampled upon and contemned. WE, EVEN IN THE TEMPLE OF JUSTICE, ARE MERE TENANTS BY SUFFERANCE.' From this, coming from a judge of the court, you may infer what has been the condition of this city the last four days and nights. My soul is pained, not that the mayor did not unsheathe the sword, call out the military, and open a path to order through the heart's-blood of thousands and cut his way to peace and tranquillity through the very bowels of humanity thus involving himself and the city in the crime of foul and inexcusable murder; but that the civil authorities of this far-famed city of brotherly love, and so many of its citizens, should harbor in their hearts such a spirit of malignant, bitter hatred to the colored man should shrink like cowards before the brutal, blustering rage of southern kidnappers and robbers should be the dupes of that scheme of fraud and injustice, the Colonization Society and so ready to offer up themselves, and the whole city, at the shrine of that spirit of slavery, that 'breathes nothing and can breathe nothing but the spirit of the bottomless pit.' I was forbidden, on Friday last, by four southern kidnappers, on pain of death, ever again to call slaveholders thieves and robbers in the city of Philadelphia. I here repeat, what I repeated to them that I know every slaveholder of the south every man that claims a right to hold and use men as property be he professed minister or Christian, be he Legislator, Judge, Governor or President, is a MAN-THIEF and a ROBBER. I say this not in defiance and bravado, but with a solemn conviction that it is true that the slaveholder will never repent, never humble himself before his crushed victim, till the world looks upon him, and he looks upon himself, as more degraded than the slave till his true character is known and read of all men. To the outraged slave and to me, his brother and fellow sufferer, the slaveholder who claims a right to traffic in our bodies and souls to use us as mere instruments to his brutal lusts and love of dominion D.D. or L.L.D. though he be, is little else than a fiend incarnate. There is but one step further in human crime; i.e. MAN-KILLING.Philadelphians, arouse yourselves! Now is the time to free yourselves from the galling, infamous yoke fastened on your necks by southern kidnappers. Purify your courts, and never again allow your brother, who flees to you for refuge from southern tyrants, to be carried back to the land of chains and whips. There stand the blackened walls of your Temple of Liberty, a monument of southern insolence and tyranny over you. If the scenes of the last four days, occasioned purely by the dictation of southern kidnappers, will not arouse you, then stoop your backs to the burden, kiss the iron hoof of slavery, crouch and cringe to southern threats, to southern daggers and bowie-knives; and let the tyrant set his foot upon your necks. But I know this outrage on your rights will arouse every noble heart among you, and nerve you up to deeds of high and holy daring in behalf of crushed and bleeding humanity. You will now throw yourselves into the 'imminent, deadly breach,' clad in the panoply of Christ, prepared to take your part with the suffering and the dumb, presenting to the kingdom of brute violence in every form, the resistless weapons of love, forgiveness, and non-resistance.   threats deeds was  chattel     banks         H.C.W.     

 CARRYING OUT THE PRINCIPLE. Enlightened public opinion as it was called when the mob murdered a number of men at Vicksburg, and burnt another to death over a slow fire at St. Louis has been busy in Philadelphia every night since Wednesday last inclusive, in carrying out the principle, and in enabling us to form a just estimate of the blessings to be derived from that self-adjusting process, which is said to manifest itself in every community, when the unnatural restraints of law are removed. We are in the midst of that which some men tell us is a purifying operation a wholesome outbreak in the body politic and we certainly cannot complain that the glorious experiment in civic economy has not been thoroughly tested. 'Hurra!' as we heard a loafer exclaim at Pennsylvania Hall, when the mob dashed in the doors, and fired the edifice. 'Hurra that's liberty!' and he writhed and kicked in the very ecstacy of delight at seeing his abstract idea of the goddess made so palpable to his physical perceptions. If that be indeed liberty, as this same learned Theban so impressively assured us, then most assuredly she has selected Philadelphia for her spring residence, and walks abroad in the evening in all her native beauty. In the first place, her followers proved their valor by throwing brick-bats into a hall filled chiefly with women secondly, she vindicated her cardinal principle of liberality, and her golden axiom, that error of opinion may be safely tolerated when truth is left free to combat it, by burning the house used by a minority for the exercise of the right of free discussion. Glorious liberty! every one has license to do exactly what we think proper. 'That's liberty!' said the Jeremy Bentham of Sixth street. Freedom of opinion being vindicated by fire in one instance, the heaven-born goddess, 'to leave no flaws or botches in the work,' next set forth to carry out the principle, and to show her love for philanthropy and popular education, and the mob attacked and fired a house erected as an asylum for colored orphans. 'Let them starve, or turn ignorant thieves and ferocious cut-throats,' must have been the moving impulse of our modern reformers in this case. Being defeated in the movement thus alluded to, religion and the freedom of the press were next to be cared for, and we find 'public opinion' demolishing the windows of a church, with the intent of likewise committing it to the flames, and on the same night clustering in thousands around a newspaper office, muttering dire threats and horrid imprecations against those who ventured to say that they entertained different notions of liberty from those cherished by the votaries of Judge Lynch. The bullet and the bayonet, however, looked so frowningly upon 'public opinion,' that the freedom of the press and the right of worship were so unfortunate as to escape being 'regulated' according to the latest and approved pattern, and doubtless he who exclaimed 'that's liberty,' put his hands into his pockets, and retired moodily to his home, mourning the obstinacy of men who are so unreasonable as to oppose being subjected to the health-giving process, and will take no lessons, although the schoolmaster is abroad. Pennsylvanian.

       The American Union have lately given signs of life, by publishing a volume of 'Letters from the West Indies,' by Sylvester Hovey, Professor in Amherst College a work neither so explicit, nor so much in detail, as that of Thome and Kimball; but perhaps its statements coming from one who avows himself 'neither an abolitionist nor a colonizationist,' may have weight with those who seem to consider abolitionism conclusive evidence of falsehood. Mr. Hovey agrees with Thome and Kimball in his representations of the result of the West India experiment. Do not the following confessions look as if the slaves were ready for freedom, for immediate emancipation? and if in Jamaica, why not in Carolina?  conclusive ready immediate      'With regard to the preparation necessary for emancipation, the experiments in the West Indies show, that is at least as essential on the part of the master, as on that of the slave; for in no case has the success of the experiment been endangered, by the conduct of the negroes, which can by no means be said of the planters, especially in Jamaica.' page 166.  for in no case has the success of the experiment been endangered, by the conduct of the negroes      The slaves, 'having been long taught unlimited obedience in the school of individual and irresponsible power, it will not appear surprising that they readily submit to the milder and more reasonable requisitions of civil authority. They manifest no incapacity to understand the nature of law, so far as it applies to them; and as was universally admitted, are peculiarly awed by its forms. I heard of no instances in which they had resisted the civil arm, or refused to acquiesce in the decisions of a legal tribunal.' page 160.Now, if this be the case in Jamaica, where, says Sir Lionel Smith, the Governor, 'the negroes are in a deplorably backward state' 'in point of intelligence,' adds Hovey, 'and moral cultivation, much behind the other Islands', surely it is a possible and probable result in Virginia and the Carolinas.The following confessions I look upon as peculiarly important, coming from one not an abolitionist. They are put forth as three general principles, established by the experiment in the West Indies.'Emancipation, instead of promoting a spirit of insurrection, is the surest means of eradicating it. Many of the troops in the colonies are already disbanded, and it is supposed that a small force, composed of negroes, to man the garrisons, will eventually be sufficient for their defence.' p. 173.'The second general principle confirmed by the experiment of the emancipation in the West Indies, is, that there is no difficulty in obtaining labor from liberated slaves for wages.' p. 175.'I state as a third general principle, deduced from the history of emancipation in the West Indies, that free labor is as cheap as slave-labor. If, in the beginning of the experiment, and under many disadvantages, free labor is as cheap as slave-labor, what may be expected in a more advanced state of the system?' p. 178.We are frequently met with an objection, that free colored people are never able to support themselves. The following picture, by those who cannot be suspected of partiality to abolition, of the condition of the colored race when the laws allow them to take care of themselves, will help to answer this. We have no right to judge of their capacity from what we see at the South, where they are burdened by oppressive laws, and blighted by the presence of slavery. The West Indies give us a specimen of what they can and will become. Having quoted the evidence of Admiral Fleming, before the House of Commons, 'that he never saw a beggar in Hayti,' Mr. Hovey remarks, speaking of the equality of the races:  they had resisted the civil arm, or refused to acquiesce in the decisions of a legal tribunal             laws allow them that he never saw a beggar in Hayti      'If from these (the slaves) we turn to the free colored and black population, we shall find still stronger evidence of natural equality. It consists in an advancement in knowledge and mental development, corresponding with their advancement in privileges. As a class, they are by no means so respectable as the whites. Some of them are more degraded than the slaves, but they can number many highly esteemed and valuable citizens. It speaks much in their favor, considering the prejudices of the planters, that in nearly every colony, they were admitted to the civil rights and privileges of the highest classes. They are found in the stations of mechanics, merchants and magistrates, also as members of the Assemblies, and in all the professions. A large proportion of the magistrates of the city of Kingston are colored and black men. Four members of the assembly are colored gentlemen. To one of whom, a well educated and highly respectable merchant of Kingston, I am indebted for many attentions. Some of them are men of wealth, though they are generally employed in the lower occupations of life, where they obtain a mere competency. There are, however, fewer people who depend upon charity among them, than among the whites, by three to one. They are able to carry on a profitable trade in the various departments of industry, and successfully to compete, either in price or skill with white people, who are engaged in the same business. Some of the most respectable mechanics in Bridgetown and Kingston are negroes, who own large establishments and employ workmen of their own color.' p. 204.To support this representation, Mr. Hovey quotes from a work entitled 'Christianity and slavery,' by Archdeacon Eliot of Barbadoes, as follows:'The free blacks have, by their superior industry, driven the lower order of whites from almost every trade requiring skill and exertion. I believe that not one in twenty of the working shoemakers in Barbadoes is a white man. The working carpenters, reasons, tailors, smiths, &c. are for the most part men of color, and this at a time when a large white population are in the lowest state of poverty, of wretchedness. In the application for casual charity, the number of white persons soliciting relief is far greater than that of free colored. The free black and colored inhabitants have always contributed, in their full proportion, to the parochial taxes for the support of the poor whites, while their own poor receive no parochial relief, but are supported by private contributions among the more wealthy of their own color.'Why should they not be the same here, when freed and protected by law? None need fear they will become a tax and burden on the charity of the whites.  mechanics, merchants and magistrates as members of the Assemblies, and in all the professions There are, however, fewer people who depend upon charity among them, than among the whites, by three to one   Christianity and slavery   a large white population lowest state of poverty, of wretchedness in their full proportion, to the parochial taxes for the support of the poor whites, while their own poor receive no parochial relief, but are supported by private contributions among the more wealthy of their own color     BOSTON.

 If the citizens of Philadelphia are resolved upon maintaining a regular government of laws, and saving their fair city from the anarchy which disgraces some other portions of our common country, they have but one course in this emergency. This course is, to strain every nerve for discovering and apprehending the perpetrators, and for inflicting upon them, after conviction, the utmost penalties of the law; and also to adopt the most vigorous measures for preventing a renewal of such outrages. If the right of discussion, upon any subject, a right made common to all by our constitutions and laws, both State and Federal, may be invaded with impunity, all freedom among us is abolished, and we are the slaves of the very worst of all tyrants, the mob. Is this the destiny of Pennsylvania? We trust that the citizens of a commonwealth, founded upon the broad and deep foundations of democratic liberty and Christian benevolence, have spirit enough to defend their fair heritage against the devastating incursions of wolves and tigers in human shape.From the symptoms manifested throughout the city, we cannot but entertain strong apprehensions of further violence. Let every citizen who would maintain the laws, buckle on his armor for fighting in earnest. Let our Mayor, who never flinches from duty because danger is in its path, call upon the military to aid the civil arm; and let our volunteer companies, under direction of the civil authority, be upon the spot, with bayonets and ball cartridges. Better is it that all the ruffians in our city, even were they a hundred thousand instead of three thousand, should bite the dust, and leave their blood knee deep in the streets, than that the great principle of freedom of speech and the press be surrendered. In our revolution, this principle cost to our country a hundred thousand valuable lives.

In the course of an animated debate, last week, in Congress, upon the spurious Treaty with the Cherokees, Mr. Legare, of South Carolina, said, admitting the fact that the Treaty was made with a power incompetent to make it on the part of the tribe, he wished to ask, whether the terms of the Treaty were illiberal whether they had not got a good price for their lands, and a better country in exchange? This Mr. Legare is one of the elite of 'southern chivalry,' and of course a highminded and honorable man! What a sacred regard for justice and humanity is evinced in his interrogations! It is of no consequence it seems whether the Cherokees are to be driven from their homes at the point of the bayonet, in order to propitiate the land-stealers of Georgia; whether they have given their sanction to any treaty for their removal, or not; whether they are protesting, in the most solemn and affecting language, against being coerced into a distant wilderness; provided they get what their rapacious persecutors choose to consider a good price for their lands, they have no just cause of complaint! Atrocious logic!   elite   

 We are told that there were black people in the assembly at Pennsylvania Hall, and even that people of different colors walked and conversed together. Well, what if they did? It might have been in bad taste, it might have been imprudent; but that is no reason for breaking a man's head, or burning his house down. Are those delicate gentlemen so particular on all other subjects? No. Had a few speeches been made in that hall, in defence of the right of slavery, no incendiary hand would have applied the torch, though hundreds of blacks had attended to hear themselves doomed to everlasting slavery. Had the hall been thronged with well-dressed debauchees and courtezans, every arm in Philadelphia would have been ready for its defence; and blacks, too, if they are only in a menial capacity, do not at all offend the delicate olfactories of the most refined society: as slaves, they can ride in stages, and be admitted to the steam-boat cabin nay, more! as cooks and body servants, they literally swarm in the kneading troughs and bed chambers of the Southern gentry; but the moment they are free, they smell so horribly, their noses are so flat, and their heels so long, they must not sit on the same level, or walk the same street, with the whites. Haverhill Gazette.   menial capacity, slaves, free, Haverhill Gazette.   

 SCORCHED OUT. It is said that Charles G. Finney, who formerly preached in the Chatham-street chapel, New York, and is now at Oberlin, styled Philadelphia 'the devil's great arm-chair, in which he rocks himself to perfect repose.' It is certain that the foul fiend has lately been disturbed in his slumbers in that city, and fairly scorched out of his easy-seat. He is bestirring himself mightily and this is a cheering sign for he comes down in great wrath, only when he knows that his time is short.     

 We turn from the sickening details with abhorrence. Our heart grows faint in the recital of this brutal outrage. It is a fearful demonstration of the triumph of licentiousness over law and good order. The demon spirit of mobism is in the ascendant, and as it rises, the star of national liberty must proportionately decline. None can have the least assurance of protection for person and property, so long as the actors, aiders and abettors in such nefarious deeds, are permitted to perpetrate them, and afterwards to go unpunished. We say permitted, because mobs always act by permission. It will not be pretended that the orderly portion of the citizens of Philadelphia could not have prevented this disgraceful transaction, if they had attended to it in season. Where was the police of the city? Where was the Mayor? Where was the Sheriff at the period when a comparatively small force would have driven these land pirates from the ground, and caused them to skulk to their hiding places, with their courage oozing out at their fingers' ends. It is true, they were there; but not at the right time, nor with sufficient force to overcome the spirit of mischief.Whose property these mob gentry intend shall next feed the flames, none but themselves can tell. The dwelling places of some of the most respectable citizens, enkindled by the torch of these outlaws, may next illuminate the darkness of midnight. If these sovereigns, who rule the city of Philadelphia, should resolve that a particular doctrine should not be taught in one of its churches, who should dare to gainsay it? And may they not take exception to what may be there uttered? We presume they have quite as little fellowship with the doctrines of the gospel as with the doctrines of abolitionism. Let those, therefore, who have anything at stake, and who look calmly and quietly on this diabolical outrage, (and there are too many such) have a care lest they themselves fall under the ban of proscription. Let them, instead of sitting down in shameless inactivity whilst the house of their neighbor is sending up flames towards heaven, bestir themselves, and assist in putting down this vile spirit of mobbing. Let them not console themselves with the reflection that they hold no opinions which it may be dangerous to utter. By to-morrow the tide may turn; expressions that are blameless to-day, may by tomorrow become treasonable; and whatever the mob declares to be treason, must be punished as such.But it behooves all of us to set our faces against this growing evil. In proportion as the orderly part of community denounce it, and evince a determined opposition to it, will it decrease. If, however, it be much longer permitted to display itself, we may bid farewell to our liberties we shall have no motive to make an attempt to preserve them; and men will seek under a stronger form of government, that security which they will be unable to find under the present.   permitted,   sovereigns,     

 MURDER ADDED TO RIOT AND ARSON. The Philadelphia Daily Focus states that an aged colored woman died on Saturday night, 19th ult. instantaneously, upon hearing the shouts of the mob in the neighborhood of where she resided, somewhere in Shippen street. She suffered considerably during the riots in Southwark a few years ago, and supposing she would be massacred, the effect was so great upon her mind, that she expired almost without a groan. Every one, therefore, who participated in the recent riot, or gave any countenance to it, is chargeable with the guilt of murder. It is a fearful thing to go with the multitude to do evil.     

 The dishonoring outrage, and invasion of the rights of person, property, and conscience, which the Postscript in yesterday's paper announced to our readers, as having occurred in Philadelphia, must and should, like all such acts of lawless violence, re-act against the doctrines by which it was stimulated.This propitiation to the Genius of Slavery, in such a city as Philadelphia, in such a State as Pennsylvania which from its earliest history has borne unwavering testimony against the blight, the curse, and the crime of holding our fellow-creatures in bondage will fill that Commonwealth, and the whole of free America, with such indignation as will infallibly accelerate the downfall of the atrocious system, which can thus, even in the midst of freemen, and where laws, and arts, and civilization prevail, prompt to such enormities.So far, then, as the ultimate result is concerned, we, who desire most earnestly to see this republic uncontaminated with slavery, and who feel that each new outrage of its votaries but hastens the period of its extinction amid our regrets at violated laws, and our indignation at the supineness of magistrates, who were forewarned by the events of the preceding evening, and should have been prepared to suppress, by grape-shot and the bayonet, if other means should fail, the lawlessness of a mob, find consolation in the reflection, that every outrage, every robbery, every arson, every murder, committed in the name of slavery, converts and diverts thousands, and tens of thousands, from its support or toleration.While, then, we truly mourn that private rights, and public law and authority, have thus been audaciously defied and insulted in Philadelphia, yet, from the very crime, we derive increased confidence both in the rectitude and the nearer triumph of the opposing cause, the cause of freedom, of morality and religion. N.Y.

 THEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS. Our correspondent 'OMEGA' is mistaken in supposing that the Liberator 'is open to theological discussion' and therefore we must decline inserting his communications upon the Moral Law and the Sabbath. All that we have published, relating to either of these subjects, was extorted from us in self defence against the malignant attacks of the signers of the Clerical Protest. The occasion of this diversion from the grand object of our paper, the abolition of American slavery, having passed away, we are not disposed to renew a theological strife in our columns. 'Omega' can have his manuscripts.     

 This attempt to put down free discussion, in a free country, will never do. It evinces a disrespect to the sovereignty of Law, absolutely dangerous and humiliating. Besides what sect or party was ever put down by persecution? Every persecuted party is like certain vivacious insects, which multiply by dissection. If Abolitionists are wrong, refute them by arguments. Gospel Banner.   Gospel Banner.   

 It seems by the following article, that the planters of Barbadoes have fully determined on having their dwellings plundered and fired, their plantations made desolate, and their own throats cut, on the 1st of August next, by giving immediate emancipation to all their slaves i.e. turning them all loose on that day! Very shocking especially as it is added that 'from all classes, there is a general expression of joy and congratulation,' in view of this approaching catastrophe!! Verily, the planters are tinctured with abolition insanity!Extract of a letter from Barbadoes to a commercial house in this city, dated 30th April.'In my last, I alluded to the prospect that the slaves, apprentices in this Island, would all be made free on the approaching 1st of August. It is now reduced to a certainty that such will be the case. The Governor, in a special communication to the House of Assembly, some time since, recommended the measure in the most explicit terms. The executive council, on the 17th instant, came to an unanimous vote in favor of it, and set forth their reasons, as published in a paper which I send you herewith. Last of all, the House of Assembly, on the 24th inst. after having laboriously canvassed the whole Island to obtain possession of the views and feelings of their constituents, appointed a committee, with 'instructions to bring in a bill for the entire emancipation of all classes of slavery apprentices, on the first of August, 1838.' I doubt whether any measure ever passed in this Island has given such general satisfaction as this. I speak not of the apprentices themselves, of whom there are upwards of 80,000 to be restored to their 'unalienable rights,' but of merchants, planters, proprietors: from all classes there is a general expression of joy and congratulation.' New-Haven Herald.       unanimous New-Haven Herald   

       THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.     Almost every paper which now reaches us, contains a burning rebuke for our mob ruled, and law-abandoned city. The voice of condemnation will reach the perpetrators of the outrage and their abettors from all quarters. Those who by their sympathy with the mob and their neglect of duty in taking no early and efficient measures to prevent it, have made themselves in a degree responsible for the disgrace which has fallen upon our city, will soon find their position an unenviable one.Letters are pouring in to us, encouraging us at this crisis, and pledging co-operation and ample assistance. Men not abolitionists, indignant at the outrage, call upon us in the name of Freedom and Justice, to go on. We make an extract from a letter we have just received from an able and influential member of the Democratic party at Washington, hitherto bitterly opposed to our measures, and, if we mistake not, a slaveholder.       WASHINGTON, D.C., May 20th, 1838.     MY DEAR SIR:  I do not let this mail depart, without bearing to you my congratulations upon the late outrage upon all decency, order, law, right, upon every sentiment and principle dear to American freedom, patriotism and pride, of which a Philadelphia mob has been guilty. Congratulations, not condolements! The building has done you more good in its single day of existence, than if it had crumbled back to the earth through whole ages of peaceful appropriation to common uses! The phoenix will of course rise again before its ashes are cold. I have a great deal of fault to find, in my judgment, with your societies but on the common ground of freedom of thought, speech, and person, and of philanthropy in a great moral cause, not the less noble because, in my opinion, unwisely pursued no prudential consideration shall restrain the expression of my sympathy for the outrage of which you have been made the objects, and of indignation towards its perpetrators. Alas, for the good old city of Penn! How has the glory departed! A few more such persecutions will compel thousands who must participate in the feelings which have prompted this letter, to leave every thing, and throw off every tie and restraint, to join you!  congratulations

 A SPECIMEN OF COLONIZATION SYMPATHY AND REGARD FOR THE COLORED RACE! BILLINGSGATE SLANG AND CONTEMPT!The spirit of African Colonization, as manifested by the great body of those who support that unnatural and hateful enterprise, is the spirit of the devil, full of malice, wrath, pride, vulgarity, proscription, and every evil passion. Never have we seen the mask more boldly thrown aside, than in the following instance. The Colonization Herald, published in Philadelphia, makes the following comment upon the burning of Pennsylvania Hall:The main object for its construction, was soon displayed by the lectures and proposed discussion on abolitionism, in which citizens of other States, both men and women, bore a conspicuous part, and to which men and women, both black and white, largely resorted. The mixing up of the people of the two colors, by their being seated promiscuously in the Hall, and their going to and returning from it in the same fashion, were not calculated to soothe the prejudices of the populace, nor to prevent any outbreaks endangering the public peace. The latent savageness in all men, and especially abundant in the ignorant and uneducated, and those without the restraints of religion, can soon be made fearfully evident. And hence it is the part not only of worldly policy, but of moral kindness, to withhold all provocatives to its display, unless some great and practical and evident and indisputable good, is to result from running counter to it. Such a maxim, however, seems to be regarded as evidence of timidity and abandonment of principle by the Anti-Slavery school, which in its demonstrations for two or three days preceding the catastrophe of Thursday night, acted as if with full intent to work up into uncontrollable fury the excitable feeling of the class of persons just mentioned.In another editorial article, in the same paper, facetiously headed 'The Philadelphia Carnival,' the following brutally contemptuous and fiendishly malignant language is held towards the friends of emancipation, and those whose cause they espouse. And this, forsooth, is the benevolent and pious spirit of Colonization, yearning for the temporal and eternal interests of the colored race!! Mark the phraseology how obviously selected to stir up the murderous fury of mobocracy! The man, who can write such an article, is a ruffian, capable of committing any crime within the achievement of human villany. The passages in italic are thus marked by us:In our quiet city of Philadelphia, in which masquerades are forbidden by legislative enactment, there has been, notwithstanding, a season of carnival. Some hundreds of persons, of both sexes and of all colors, the more prominent of whom were white, black and yellow, had agreed to keep high festival, in honor of a hybrid and piebald equality, which they invoked in a new and spacious edifice recently erected by some of their associates in the idolatrous worship.Acting on a resolution of the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, which was convened in New York in May 1837, of having 'our colored friends seated promiscuously in all our congregations,' these meetings exhibited, we learn, the desired commingling in the Pennsylvania Hall. Whatever might be thought of the taste of those who went there, to enjoy the various appeals made to their senses, always excepting common sense, as the visit of all was voluntary and with a foreknowledge of the circumstances, they could not rightfully complain. But when the exhibition became still more public, and out of doors, by groups of white and black intermingled here a black beau escorting two interesting and pretty white females there a white man, more advanced in years, parading up and down a street with a sable dame on each arm, and a procession in the most public street of black and white duly intermixed the people began to express their dissatisfaction in various terms and degrees of intensity, against an innovation for which they could not see or divine any useful purpose in the interests of either the white or the black race. They forgot, however, the privileges of carnivals, and that it is among the reserved rights of the sovereign people, or of any portion of them, to play the fool after every imaginable variety of fashion, within the pale of law. Sometimes deficiencies and omissions in the last are supplied by presentments of grand juries for nuisances, and occasionally the safety of the passengers in the street, or the quiet of a neighborhood, is secured by an order de lunatico inquirendo. Recourse might have been had to one or both of these means, according to the extravagance of deportment and language of these black and white mummers, and mockers of philanthropy.Unhappily, Folly with her cap and bells was not the only president of these doings. The Lord of Misrule was also there, or at least his part was enacted by one who, first in Baltimore, and subsequently in Boston, had figured so conspicuously in the same character. The man who, when in England, as agent of the New England Anti-Slavery Society, declared the Constitution of the United States to be 'the most bloody and heaven-daring arrangement ever made by man for the continuance and protection of a system of the most atrocious villany ever exhibited on earth' and again, that 'such a compact was, in the nature of things, and according to the law of God, null and void from the beginning;' this same man, the too notorious William Lloyd Garrison, who has also declared Washington to be worse than a robber and a pirate, was the acting Lord of Misrule, chosen to aid in reconciling Philadelphians to the new carnival. Caution and moderation were, we learn, abjured by him; he insisted on more excitement; he was for agitation the watchword of his party.Misrule, by the abrogation of existing institutions and a scornful and bitter denunciation of the constitution and laws, and denial of their binding character on the citizens, preached in abolition halls, and debated and urged by abolition presses, must unsettle the minds of the thoughtless, the discontented in any way, the ignorant and the passionate, and drive them to excesses against which no repressing influence can be brought to bear, because none is acknowledged. But one excess provokes, and gives excuse for another. Modern abolition denounces and dooms to perdition all who do not without restriction or reserve adopt its dogmas in full. Thus far speech; but it also acts out its dogmas in a manner to annoy and distress all, and to goad to outbreaks of violence, others who plead plausibly, though erroneously, the very freedom of action, which is so much insisted on by the abolitionists themselves. Abolitionists deny the validity of the grand compact by which we are held together as a nation they decry and vilify the churches, whose pastors and members do not think precisely as they do. One set of anti-abolitionists act out this radical doctrine, and contravene and set at nought the laws made under the constitution, and the doctrines and examples of peace set by the reviled churches. Law and religion are to abolitionism a dead letter, unless they both conform to its constructions made with reference to the natural law of entire and unconditional equality. Availing of this example, certain anti-abolitionists recur to what they would call the first principles of society, and set up natural laws of their own, by which they judge, and condemn, and punish, their opponent abolitionists. Thus is the misrule preached and advocated by abolitionism in one sense, acted out by their passionate opposers in another sense; and thus not only this community, but the whole Union, is to be alarmed and agitated, and its institutions broken down, and the laws set at nought, and the security of person and property to become a dead letter. A remedy for these evils must be found, and speedily forthcoming. It is not to be of the nature of force or violence repressive it may be, but not vindictive. It must be a well regulated and clearly understood, but not even loudly expressed public opinion. It need not be exhibited at all in town meetings and resolutions, any more than in mob assemblages, and fire and destruction. The true remedy is in every citizen making up his mind clearly, distinctly and deliberately, not merely to abstain from, but steadily by deportment and conversation and in social intercourse, to oppose that fierce fanaticism, which, under the name of abolitionism, would abrogate the Constitution of the United States, declare illegal and void the constitution of each separate State, and the laws administered under it, and revile the religion and the most disinterested piety of any and every sect which should be in the least adverse, or even not directly in unison with its schemes of revolutionary change, and of foreign alliance and aid. Cold and formal neutrality will not now suffice. It is by such indifference to the question agitated, and quiet contempt for the fury of these abolition fanatics, that they have gathered strength claiming that they were strong wherever they were thus impliedly tolerated. Let the good sense of the people draw the line of demarcation clearly, and it will then be easy, by a distinct perception, and full knowledge of the nuisance, to abate it, and to procure additional aid in new laws, if the present are found to be inefficient.        both black and white, two colors, promiscuously prejudices populace,  acted as if with full intent to work up into uncontrollable fury   facetiously italic   white, black yellow, piebald idolatrous worship.

     PORT-AU-PRINCE, May 5, 1838.   The town is in commotion, from an attempt to assassinate Gen. Inginac on the morning of the 2d. The General was shot in his chamber by a ruffian, stated to have been sent express from Leogane. The ball passed through his neck, coming out through his mouth, breaking his under jaw. A revolt, it is said, took place this morning at Leogane. The National Guards are all under arms, and great anxiety is manifested on all sides. We hope, however, for a peaceable result. The wound of Gen. Inginac is supposed to be mortal. (He stands next in rank and office to President Boyer.)    

 An Arrest. We learn that a man, who is represented to be of a highly respectable family, was arrested on Tuesday, and taken before Alderman Binns, charged with having been concerned in the recent destruction of Pennsylvania Hall. Mr. Shotwell appeared as the principal witness, and testified that he was in the Hall on the night of the conflagration, and saw the prisoner busily engaged in tearing down the blinds, and inciting others to the destruction of the building. He has known the prisoner for eight or ten years, and is positive as to the individual, who was bound over in the sum of three thousand dollars for his appearance before the Aldermen on Friday, at 12 o'clock. Philad.

       THE FOURTH ANNUAL MEETING of the New Hampshire Anti-Slavery Society will be holden on Thursday the SEVENTH of June next, at ten o'clock forenoon, at the South Church in Concord. Every auxiliary society, it is hoped, will be fully represented. All abolitionists are invited to attend, and take a part in the doings of the meeting. Several distinguished philanthropists of other states are expected to attend.    

                      WHEREAS, I have learned with the deepest regret, that the soil of Pennsylvania has been disgraced, the rights of her peaceful citizens outraged, and their property destroyed by acts of lawless riot. For the first time the orderly city of Philadelphia has become the theatre of scenes heretofore only contemplated at a distance, as dangerous excesses on the part of others. They have now been enacted in our midst, and assumed a form, the most destructive of property and domestic quiet, the most inimical to individual rights, and the most ruinous to social harmony and public order that can be conceived.The torch of the incendiary has been applied by unmasked violaters of law, in the darkness of night, in the heart of a crowded city, and for the avowed purpose of preventing the exercise of the constitutional and invaluable right of 'the free communication of thoughts and opinions.' And whereas, if it be true, that if even 'error of opinion may be tolerated while reason is left free to combat it,' the practice of combating supposed error with the firebrand, or of punishing even crime without the established process of law, must be the very essence of tyranny. And whereas, it is the duty of the magistrate to protect all in the exercise of their constitutional rights without respect to the question whether their respective objects be or be not agreeable to himself or others, so long as their deportment is peaceful and the object lawful.And whereas, it is the duty of the Governor of this Commonwealth, 'to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,' especially in cases where enormity transcends the magnitude of common guilt:Therefore, for the purpose of promoting and securing the apprehension of the wrong doers in the premises, I, Joseph Ritner, Governor of the said Commonwealth, do hereby offer a reward of five hundred dollars for the apprehension and conviction of each and every person engaged in the burning of the building called the Pennsylvania Hall, in Sixth street, in the city of Philadelphia, on the night of Thursday, the 17th inst., or in setting fire to the building called the orphan's asylum, in Thirteenth st., in the said city, on the night of Friday, the eighteenth instant, to be paid on the due conviction of each and every one of the persons aforesaid.And all Judges, Justices, Sheriffs, Coroners, Constables and other officers within this Commonwealth, are hereby required and enjoined to be attentive and vigilant in inquiring after and bringing to justice the person or persons guilty of the crime aforesaid.Given under my hand and the Great Seal of the State, this twenty-second day of May, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Commonwealth the sixty-second.              By the Governor.     THOMAS H. BURROWS,Secretary of the Commonwealth.      

               On visiting the grave of a near and beloved friend.     I come to view the sacred spot, Where restest thou, departed one;To thee affection's tear is nought, The voice of grief an idle tone.       The storms of winter, wild and loud, Have spent their fury o'er thy head;New verdure crowns thy still abode, And flowers their sweetest fragrance shed.       Yes, spring returns, but not to me, With gladsome smiles, and balmy breath;On all around, beneath, I see The image and the gloom of death.       The Son of God with anguish wept, Above the dark sepulchral stone,Beneath whose moss-grown bosom slept A friend, a Saviour's love could own.       Then shall not one sad-stealing tear, For thee, its secret fountain leave,Who slumberest where alike appear The tyrant and the tortured slave?       The infidel may fiercely scorn Affliction's ready sign to show;But dark the bosom and forlorn, That cannot feel becoming wo.       O grave insatiate! though thou hold, Within thy grasp, the mouldering dustThe spark immortal, uncontroll'd, Shall mingle with the ransomed just.       Lamented one! my soul salutes Thy spirit with unconquer'd loveAffection only deeper roots, As time's swift currents onward move.       If thou art of the countless throng, Who wear the snow-white robes on high,And ceaseless chant the eternal song Of glory, praise and victory;       Then why should sorrow crush the heart? Why sadness rest upon my brow?Joy should abate the deep-felt smart, The breast with living rapture glow.       O Thou, who only wounds to heal! 'Twas thine to call for what thou gave;Then teach submission to thy will Me from repining kindly save.       Grant me to catch the patriarch's faith, And mercy see in all thy ways;What else can gild the darksome path? The hopes of care-worn pilgrims raise?       Thy mercies speed the chastening blow, And cherished prospects early blight,To bring us at thy footstool low, Thou centre of all life and light.       Into thine all-sustaining hand, My dearest, earthly trust I yieldUpon the glass-like sea to stand, With immortality revealed.       Lynn, 5th mo. 1838.     O.     

          MAYOR'S OFFICE, May 23, 1838.   The excitement growing out of the daring outrage perpetrated against the laws, having subsided, I take the earliest opportunity of making known to my fellow citizens my determination of adopting every means within my power to arrest and bring to trial those who so recklessly defied the Law. I therefore hereby offer a reward of TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS, for the apprehension and conviction of the vile perpetrator or perpetrators who, on Thursday night last, broke into and fired the Pennsylvania Hall.   May 23, 1838.     JOHN SWIFT, Mayor.   In our opinion, as well as that of thousands, the Mayor of Philadelphia ought to be the first person to be sent to prison, and Sheriff Watmough is the second, for their conduct during the riot. Why does not some one have these men arrested, and claim the reward offered as above?    

                    'Woodman, spare that tree.'     Sportsman, spare that bird, On that old oaken bough;Its song my soul hath stirred, And I will save it How.In my forefather's cot, I've listened to that lay;Then, sportsman, harm it not, But let it fly away.           That sweet familiar song, I still would gladly hear;It swells both clear and strong On my delighted ear;Through many a far off sky, It pours forth that sweet layI cannot see it die: Thy murderous purpose stay!           Look up to yonder tree; There rocks its little nestYoung man, it must not be Wound not its gentle breast,Upon that old oak tree, He carols forth his joy;It once o'ershadowed me, When I was but a boy.           O let that robin sing! I listen to his lays,And memory seems to bring The scenes of other days.Go seek some other game, Thy sporting pouch to fill;Forbear thy deadly aim, And let it warble still!            G.     

              Afric! thou shalt be free, The mandate has gone forth,Thou shalt no longer be A by-word on the earth.       Captive! lift up thine eyes; See yonder dawning light,Which streaks the Northern skies, Amid the gloom of night:       It is no fitful ray, Gleaming athwart the heaven;Ere it shall pass away, Thy fetters shall be riven.       Dark clouds will skirt the sky, By angry tempests driven;Hoarse thunders pealing by, Break through the arch of heaven.       Yet, still that light shall rise Higher, and yet more high,And spread to Southern skies, And beam on every eye.       Afric! thou shalt be free! That day shall surely come;The trump of jubilee Shall call the exile home.        B.     

              Must we leave our native land? Falsely, cruelly beguiledMust we, poor heart-stricken band, Journey to a distant wild?       White Man! see this lovely vale! Mark yon mountains' lofty brow!Lo! one universal wail, Forms their only echo now.       Here, our infant footsteps strayed, All our boyish sports were here,Here, beneath this forest shade, Manhood chased the bounding deer.       Here, our peaceful hamlet rose, Scene of all our early loves,Here, our Father's bones repose, Shrouded in their native groves.       Oh, how cruel memory brings, Thronging to this burning brain,Thoughts, that every fibre wrings With the ceaseless throe of pain!       Aged Mother! dry that tear; Hush! Oh! hush, my weeping child;Cease my Wife that mute despair, Do not drive Yazooma wild.       Oh! that agonizing sob, How it makes my life-strings start!'Twas the last convulsive throb, It has burst this-aching heart.       Camden, N.J. May 19th, 1838.     S.

On the 14th, agreeably to public notice, the doors of the PENNSYLVANIA HALL were thrown open, and the spacious Saloon filled with one of the largest audiences ever assembled in this city. The President of the Association, DANIEL NEAL, took the chair at 10 o'clock.WILLIAM DORSEY, from the Committee of Arrangements, made the following statement:'A number of individuals of all sects, and those of no sect, of all parties, and those of no party being desirous that the citizens of Philadelphia should possess a room, wherein the principles of Liberty and Equality of Civil Rights could be freely discussed, and the evils of slavery fearlessly portrayed, have erected this building, which we are now about to dedicate to Liberty and the Rights of Man. The total cost of the building will be about 40,000 dollars. This has been divided into two thousand shares of twenty dollars each. A majority of the stockholders are mechanics, or working men, and, (as is the case in almost every other good work,) a number are females.The building is not to be used for Anti-Slavery purposes alone. It will be rented from time to time, in such portions as shall best suit applicants, for any purpose not of an immoral character. It is called 'Pennsylvania Hall,' in reference to the principles of Pennsylvania; and our Motto, like that of the commonwealth, is      Liberty Equality of Civil Rights   is not to be used for Anti-Slavery purposes alone. any purpose not of an immoral character.

     Letter of Hon. Francis James of the Senate of Pennsylvania.      HARRISBURG, Dec. 22d, 1837.     Gentlemen, I received your favor of the 18th inst. yesterday. Gentlemen,  The acceptance of the invitation with which the Managers of the 'Pennsylvania Hall Association' have been pleased to honor me, circumstances, not within my control, oblige me respectfully to decline. But I do so with the kindest feelings toward the objects for which the building was erected, and to which it is to be dedicated.My humble efforts have been uniformly directed to the maintenance of Freedom of Speech, and of the Press, as well as to the Rights of Man generally; and I rejoice to know that there is, at least, one house within this great commonwealth, wherein those rights may be advocated, free from interruption.Please present my acknowledgments to the Managers of your Association, for the honor intended to be conferred upon me, and accept for yourselves and them assurances of my friendship and regard.Very respectfully,           FRANCIS JAMES.     Messrs. Saml. Webb,Wm. H. Scott,Committee. Saml. Webb,Wm. H. Scott,     

     PETERBORO, Dec. 26th, 1837.     Messrs. S. Webb and Wm. H. Scott.  Much esteemed Friends, Your favor of the 18th instant came to hand yesterday. I had, several days before, received the Extra of the National Enquirer, containing a very interesting account of the celebration in 'the Carpenter's Shop,' and my whole heart rejoiced in the noble enterprise of the stockholders and builders of the 'Pennsylvania Hall.' Long may this Hall stand to testify to the sacred regard for Human Rights in which it originated, and to furnish rich gratifications of the mind to the lovers of Free Discussion.The honor done me by your Board of Managers is gratefully acknowledged by me. Such, however, are my circumstances, and so pressing are the demands on my time, that I cannot accept the invitation 'to deliver an address' on the occasion of the opening of the Hall. Be assured that I should rejoice to be with you with the friends of the Freedom of Speech, and of cherished humanity on that interesting occasion but under the claims of my business to my time, I find it very difficult to leave home.  Much esteemed Friends,     I am, with great regard, your friend,     GERRIT SMITH.     

     Letter of Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, of the State Legislature.      GETTYSBURG, May 4th, 1838.   Gentlemen, I have delayed answering your letter of the 10th of December last, until this time, that I might be able to decide with certainty, whether I could comply with your invitation, to be present at the opening of the 'Pennsylvania Hall for the Free Discussion of Liberty and equality of Civil Rights, and the evils of slavery.'I regret that I cannot be with you on that occasion. I know of no spectacle, which it would give me greater pleasure to witness, than the dedication of a Temple of Liberty. Your object should meet with the approbation of every freeman. It will meet with the approbation of every man, who respects the rights of others, as much as he loves his own. Interest, fashion, false religion, and tyranny, may triumph for a while, and rob man of his inalienable rights: but the people cannot always be deceived, and will not always be oppressed.The slaveholder claims his prey by virtue of that Constitution which contradicts the vital principles of our Declaration of Independence. But while it remains unchanged, it must be supported. If his heart exacts the fulfilment of the cruel bond, let him take the pound of flesh, but not one drop of blood. This we must yield to existing laws, not to our sense of justice. I can never acknowledge the right of slavery. I will bow down to no Deity, however worshipped by professing christians, however dignified by the name of Goddess of Liberty, whose footstool is the crushed necks of groaning millions, and who rejoices in the resoundings of the tyrant's lash, and the cries of his tortured victims.Very respectfully,Your obedient servant,  Gentlemen,   should will   right        THADDEUS STEVENS.     Samuel Webb and others, Committee. Samuel Webb    

     NEW YORK, Jan. 3d, 1838.     Messrs. S. Webb and Wm. H. Scott:  My dear friends, I thank you for your kind letter, inviting me, in the name of the Managers of the Pennsylvania Hall Association, to deliver an address at the opening of the Pennsylvania Hall for free discussion.It is now a year and a half since I have been prevented from speaking in public, by an affection of the throat, and there is little prospect that I shall be able to do so for months or years, or perhaps ever again with impunity. Under these circumstances, it is due to the committee and to the cause, respectfully, to decline your appointment.I exult in the erection of your 'Temple of Freedom,' and the more, as it is the first and only one in a republic of fifteen millions, consecrated to free discussion and equal rights.For years, they have been banished from our halls of legislation and of justice, from our churches and our pulpits. It is befitting, that the city of Benezet and Franklin should be the first to open an asylum, where the hunted exiles may find a home. God grant that your Pennsylvania Hall may be free indeed.The empty name is every where, free government, free men, free speech, free people, free schools, and free churches. Hollow counterfeits, all! FREE! It is the climax of irony, and its million echoes are hisses and jeers even from the earth's ends. FREE! Blot it out. Words are the signs of things. The substance has gone! Let fools and madmen clutch at shadows. The husk must rustle the more when the kernel and the ear are gone! Rome's loudest shout for liberty was when she murdered it, and drowned its death-shrieks in her hoarse [ ]. She never raised her hands so high as to swear allegiance to freedom, as when she gave the death-stab, and madly leaped upon its corpse! and her most delirious dance was among the clods her hands had cast upon its coffin! FREE! The word and sound are omnipresent masks and mockers! An impious lie! unless they stand for free Lynch law, and free murder, for they are free.Where are the murderers of Lovejoy? 'Free;' going at large with law for a volunteer escort, holding up their bloody hands along the streets of Alton, and telling how they killed him their lives virtually insured by the official endorsement of the highest legal officer in the state. But, I'll hold the times demand brief speech, but mighty deeds. On, my brethren! uprear your temple!  My dear friends,       free indeed.   name free free free free free free Blot it out. things. Lynch law, murder are     Your brother in the sacred strife for all, all,     THEODORE D. WELD.     

    The following letter from EX-PRESIDENT ADAMS was received with much applause:     WASHINGTON, 19th Jan. 1838.     Samuel Webb and Wm. H. Scott, Philadelphia:  My respected friends I learnt with great satisfaction, by your letter of the 18th of last month, that the Pennsylvania Hall Association have erected a large building in your city, wherein liberty and equality of civil rights can be freely discussed, and the evils of slavery fearlessly portrayed.The right of discussion upon slavery, and an indefinite extent of topics connected with it, is banished from one half the States of this Union. It is suspended in both houses of Congress opened and closed at the pleasure of the slave representation: opened for the promulgation of nullification sophistry; closed against the question, WHAT IS SLAVERY? at the sound of which, the walls of the capitol staggered like a drunken man!For this suppression of the freedom of speech, of the freedom of the press, and of the right of petition, the people of the FREE States of this Union (by which I mean the people of the non-slaveholding States) are responsible, and the people of Pennsylvania most of all.Of this responsibility, I say it with a pang sharper than language can express, the city of Philadelphia must take to herself the largest share. And this consideration would compel me to decline the invitation with which the managers of the Association have honored me, to deliver an address at the opening of the Hall, were it otherwise in my power, as it probably will not be, to attend at the time proposed.My friends, I have a long-standing, high, respectful, and affectionate attachment to the city of Philadelphia, and its inhabitants. It dates from the day of the Declaration of Independence, and if I were to address them on the opening of your Hall, I should comment upon some of its self-evident truths.Now a great multitude of the present inhabitants of your city have grown sick of the sound of these self-evident truths, and exceedingly adverse to hearing any comment upon them. If I should make any practical use of my freedom of speech, some would say, he is doling out a farrago of abstractions. Others, what is the use of commenting upon self-evident truths? Others not a few would kindle into indignation, and say, he is intermeddling with the peculiar institutions of the South, that's unconstitutional! What's that to him? What's that to us? He's a fanatic, he is an incendiary, he is an abolitionist! he is attacking the rights of the States, he is provoking the people of the south, and, Lord have mercy upon us, they will dissolve the Union!All this I could hear and endure with composure all this I have heard before, and shall hear again. But if, while I should be discoursing, a native citizen of Philadelphia should rise, and say, What right have you, sir, to come here, and dogmatize with us upon the rights of freedom, and the duties of freemen? Is not this the city of William Penn, and do you come here to lecture us upon the freedom of conscience? Is not this the city whence issued the Declaration of Independence? And do you come to teach us the doctrine of inalienable rights? Have we so far degenerated from the virtues of our fathers, that we must go to Plymouth for our political creed? Have we no native sons of our own city, capable of explaining to us the principles of human liberty, as well as you?My true-hearted friends, I should have no answer, satisfactory to myself, to give to such inquiries.I rejoice that in the city of Philadelphia, the friends of free discussion have erected a hall for its unrestrained exercise. I know that the people of Philadelphia need a voice as of one from the wilderness, to rally them to the standard of human rights, but that voice must come from among themselves. If there is not one native, I say not of Pennsylvania, but of the city of Philadelphia, who dares to tell you the truth in tones that shall reach to the sepulchres of the dead, lock up your Hall on the same day that you shall open it, and wait for the appointed time: it will surely come.I must apologize to you even for writing to you with so much freedom. I hope it may be without offence, for to avoid that is precisely my reason for declining to deliver the address which you invite. Nothing could delight me more than to address the inhabitants of Philadelphia upon the opening in their city of a hall devoted to free discussion, could I speak to them my whole mind, without giving to many of them great offence. This would be impossible.It would have been perhaps more discreet to answer that, independent of all other considerations, my detention here in the discharge of indispensable duties, would, in all probability, preclude the possibility of my engaging to visit Philadelphia at the indicated time. I shall therefore request you to accept that as my answer, and to consider the remnant of this letter only as a testimonial of my respectful sensibility to your invitation, and of my fervent wishes that the Pennsylvania Hall may fulfil its destination, by demonstrative proof, that freedom of speech in the city of Penn shall no longer be AN ABSTRACTION.  My respected friends   suspended          peculiar institutions of the South, fanatic, incendiary, he is an abolitionist!       need       I am faithfully your friend,     JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.     

     TROY, N.Y., January 8th, 1838.   Respected Friends, Your letter on the subject of the Pennsylvania Hall, was received some days since, but owing to engagements. I could not well reply to it till this morning. I need hardly say, that I feel a deep interest in your movements. I trust the spirit of old Pennsylvania is awaking from its slumbers, and will make itself known through all this republic. It has been a matter of deep regret, that no place among you has been open to free discussion. Yours is the last city in the Union where this fact ought to exist. And I do rejoice, that a few friends of liberty are now about to roll away this reproach. I trust the whole country, as well as your city, will feel the influence of your enterprise.In relation to the invitation which you have given me, to make an address at the opening of the Hall, I feel much gratified by the favor you have conferred upon me. I accept of the appointment, and if a kind Providence permit, I shall endeavor to fulfil it.  Respected Friends,      Most respectfully yours,  NATHAN S.S. BEMAN.     

     TROY, N.Y., April 12th, 1838.   My Respected Friends, I received your kind letter, informing me of the arrangements made for opening the Pennsylvania Hall, some time since, and have been waiting for more light in regard to the will of Providence respecting my own participation in the services of that truly important era in your city. When I accepted your appointment, I had no doubt but I could be with you, and perform the part assigned me. Indeed, I felt highly honored in your choice, and my feelings were deeply enlisted. But since the early part of February, my health has been much impaired, and is at this time very precarious. Such are my deep convictions as to my own inability to fulfil the high duties which have been kindly assigned me by the committee, that I ought no longer to postpone the painful task of advising you of the fact. I know you will feel a disappointment in this matter, but I do assure you it should be otherwise, if it were in my power. My own heart is with you; my best efforts in the cause of freedom and in favor of the oppressed, should be made on that occasion, had I strength to embark in this truly beneficent work. But Providence has decided otherwise, and it is my duty to submit. May all these matters be directed for good, and our very disappointments serve to advance the cause. As to your enterprise, it is a noble one. It was called for, and I trust it will prosper. We cannot sell the rights of conscience, the freedom of speech, and the liberty of the press. We cannot forbear to express our abhorrence of chains and stripes; and should we do it, the very stones would cry out. I rejoice that there is a spirit still in existence, and still awake, in your venerable city, that will not bow to the altar of slavery, nor tamely submit to the dictation of those who declare in high places that it is a wise and holy institution, and that it shall be perpetual. What a contest is this to be waged in a land of republicanism, and a land of Christianity? But if the charters of these two systems the Declaration of Independence and the Bible are permitted to speak, how certain it is that the rights of man will be triumphant!With deep and heartfelt sympathy in your movements, and with the most cordial and personal regard, I am yours truly,  My Respected Friends, Pennsylvania Hall, chains stripes; the very stones would cry out. slavery, republicanism, Christianity? the rights of man will be triumphant!      NATHAN S.S. BEMAN.     

     December 25th, 1837. December   Dear Sirs, I have just returned from New York, which must account to you for not having earlier answered your letter of the 18th, on the subject of delivering the first address in the Pennsylvania Hall. By the first address, I presume you mean a dedicatory address.For some time past, I have invariably declined applications that might be calculated to take any portion of my time from my profession. But I have always said, and now say again, that I will fight the battle of Liberty, as long as I have a shot in the locker. Of course, I will do what you require.Yours truly,  Dear Sirs,   always again,      DAVID PAUL BROWN.     S. Webb, and Wm. A. Scott, Esqs. S. Webb, and Wm. A. Scott, Esqs.  Immediately upon the reading of this, David Paul Brown stepped upon the stage, and amidst the cheers of the immense audience, said, 'And I am here to redeem my pledge!' His address was an able and eloquent vindication of the great principles of civil and personal liberty.We cannot but regret, however, that he should have injured the effect of his able production, by attempting to point out a plan for the gradual abolition of slavery, and by advancing sentiments which, to say the least of them, were manifestly inconsistent with others far more liberal and praiseworthy in the same address.On the 15th, letters were read from Frederick A. Graves, of Alton, Ill.; Hon. Thomas Morris, U. States Senator from Ohio; Hon. Wm. Slade, of the House of Representatives, and other gentlemen. A Poetical Address, on the occasion of the opening of a Hall for Free Discussion, was read, and was followed by a speech by Lewis C. Gunn, on the subject of Free Discussion, and by C.C. Burleigh, on that of Indian Wrongs an affecting and eloquent appeal, in the midst of which a letter from the chief of the Cherokees, JOHN ROSS, to the Hall Association, was read. He was followed by ALVAN STEWART, Esq., who gave a painfully interesting sketch of the Seminole war, and of its connection with slavery. William L. Garrison being loudly called for, came forward, and in a brief but impressive manner, alluded to the address at the opening of the Hall, and while he spoke in terms of the warmest eulogy of some portions of it, commented with great severity upon its inconsistency and doctrinal unsoundness. In the course of his remarks, he made an allusion which called up Dr. Sleigh, the lecturer against Infidelity, and a brief debate took place, in which Garrison, Burleigh, and Stewart participated. The speech of the latter gentleman was a fine burst of eloquence, to which the great audience responded at almost every sentence.In the evening, addresses were delivered by GEORGE FORD, Jr., of Lancaster, whose able advocacy of Free Discussion in the House of Representatives of this State, is worthy of all praise. He was followed by ALVAN STEWART, Esq., and ALANSON ST. CLAIR, of Essex county, Massachusetts. The meeting was completely thronged.Yesterday morning, the subject of slavery was discussed by Alvan Stewart and E.C. Pritchett, Esqs. of Utica, and Alanson St. Clair. Elder Frederick Plummer, of this city, spoke at some length, and without committing himself on either side of the question. He was followed by Wm. H. Burleigh, who, in a short but very able speech, stated the reasons of the abolitionists for rebuking the slaveholder, and not suffering sin upon him.Yesterday afternoon, Alvan Stewart made his closing speech, in the presence of an immense auditory.Thus has ended the Dedication of Pennsylvania Hall to Liberty and the Rights of Man. Long may that Hall stand the pride and ornament of the city of Penn. It will yet be prized by her citizens more highly than Faneuil Hall is by the Bostonians. That was erected to secure the rights of a part of the community this is sacred to the rights of ALL.    gradual           part   

       The Philadelphia Ledger says that it has information from an authentic source, which will lead to the conclusion that the Mayor and Sheriff were too great cowards to interfere with the mob at the late riot in that city. We can hardly doubt that if the Mayor and the Sheriff, with a posse of constables well armed, provided militia could not at the moment be procured, had made their appearance during the riot, and loudly called on all good citizens to assist in keeping the peace of the city, that they would have found efficient supporters from among the spectators who were present and this outrage, so disgraceful to the 'city of Brotherly Love,' would not have occurred.The Pennsylvanian states that in the outset, the active rioters were neither numerous nor resolute that feeble attacks were made at first, till the cheers of the mob inspirited the assailants but that when the street gas lamp which shown upon them was extinguished, and the word fire began to be bandied about, they took courage, and proceeded, as has already been detailed. Some difficulty was apparently experienced in firing the building but wherever flashes appeared, they were greeted with shouts. Impunity was guaranteed by the absence of police.     Impunity was guaranteed by the absence of police.   

 AWFUL. The lives lost by the explosion of the steamer Oronoko are now computed at one hundred and ten!   one hundred and ten!   

       The horrors of the slave trade. The Duke of Wellington on Tuesday, in reference to the horrors of the slave trade, declared that he had been authorized to state, and that he did state to the Congress at Vienna, which he had attended, that slaves were confined in casks with their irons upon them; that a number of casks had been floating past vessels which were in pursuit of the slave ships. He had proved to the satisfaction of that Congress, that no less than 60,000 or 80,000 persons were exported from the shores of Africa to those of America, and the neighboring islands, every year. That point, he repeated, was proved beyond all dispute before one of the Congresses, which he had had the honor of attending on behalf of this country. Under such circumstances, (the noble Duke added,) that he should be happy to concur in any measure which should tend to put an end entirely to that practice. English paper.

 Important from Texas. The last mails from New Orleans brings us information of considerable interest. The Texan Congress have adopted unanimously a resolution instructing their minister here, to withdraw, unconditionally, the application of the Republic to be admitted into the Union. Thus have the abolition whigs deprived us of a vast and fertile territory of the last consequence to the south. This is another 'GLORIOUS WHIG VICTORY!' This is the first instalment paid by the south for the promised elevation of Mr. Clay, or some other national abolition whig candidate to the Presidency. The next instalment will be paid on the application of Florida to be admitted as a State. The northern whigs have already determined to oppose the admission, unless slavery be abolished.We presume the Mexican paper in this city will rejoice at this intelligence. Washington Chronicle.

 Sudden Death of the Rev. Professor Knowles. The Rev. J.D. Knowles, Professor of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Duties in the Newton (Baptist) Theological Institution, died yesterday afternoon (9th inst.) at his residence at Newton, of the varioloid. He had just returned from New York, where he had been to attend the anniversaries of various religious and benevolent societies, and where it is supposed he contracted the disease.A lot of chaps at Indiana city, formed a resolution to ride one Asa Crapo on a rail. Two of them, one named Chase, went to Crapo's house to get him out. They found him in bed, and when they approached to drag him out, he being apprised of their object, stabbed Chase with a butcher knife through the heart. He was arrested, but admitted to bail in $500.The Washington Globe publishes information from Mississippi, representing the inhabitants of that State as suffering most deplorably from the deranged state of the currency it says, 'The Mississippi planters are torn up by the roots their families scattered their horses and other means of making a crop, borne off by the sheriff and their lands, and every household comfort, swallowed up by confiscating law suits.'VICKSBURG is suffering by her own Lynching system. Individuals blacklegs, so called are firing the city in revenge for the outrages committed on their friends by Lynching. One individual sufferer by a late steamboat disaster, acknowledged just before his death, that he was one of the incendiaries who lately set fire to that city, which is now kept in a constant state of alarm.The General Assembly of the Presbyterian church, at Philadelphia, has divided, and the two divisions are sitting under distinct organizations. The 'new school party' has elected the Rev. Dr. Fisher, of New Jersey, Moderator, and Drs. Mason and Gilbert the stated and permanent clerks.The Rev. Dr. Plumer, of Virginia, is Moderator of the 'old school,' and the Rev. E.W. Crane, of Long Island, N.Y. clerk. It is thought that this division will be permanent. The 'new school' have a large majority.ILL LUCK. A southern paper in mentioning the death of four negro children, by an avalanche of earth falling on them while they were at play, heads his article 'Ill Luck,' and says 'they were the property of a Mr. Solomans, whose loss by their death is estimated at $1500 and $2000.'Mr. William Comer, an overseer of Mr. Webster, of Rockingham county, N.C., was foully murdered on the 19th ult. by a gang of negroes belonging to the plantation.

       Friends The Philadelphia Association for the Moral and Mental Improvement of the People of Color, being desirous of increasing the efforts necessary for carrying forward the moral and mental elevation of the people of color, will hold their Annual Council in Philadelphia, on the First Monday in June next. The Trustees, Wardens or Vestrymen, of the several colored congregations throughout the Union, whose constituted appointment makes them the guardians of the morality of their people, are particularly requested to send delegates of their respective congregations to said Council. Associations formed auxiliary to the Philadelphia Association, and the Literary, Charitable, and Beneficial Societies, are requested to send delegates to the ensuing Council, any number not exceeding five. Female Societies who have male directors, are requested to send their directors as delegates. The education of the rising generation, who are to occupy the seats in society that are now occupied by ourselves, is an important consideration, as well as a duty which should never be lost sight of; for the establishing of liberal and correct principles by it in the minds of the young, would be leaving them a legacy calculated to increase the joys of social intercourse.

                 It is proposed to publish at Jackson, Jackson county, Michigan, a paper bearing the above title, and devoted to the discussion of the Abolition of American Slavery.A crisis has approached on the subject of involuntary servitude in these United States, consequent upon an exposure of its enormities and discussion upon the best plans of relief, from which there is no receding. The subject must be met openly, manfully and decidedly by the American people. There is no disguising the matter. Abolitionists have nothing to disguise; but contrarywise, they court popular scrutiny. Concealment, on the other hand, is utter, irretrievable ruin and the nation's overthrow. The spirit of Slavery, as developed in the late Alton Massacre, has shown us that there is no longer liberty or safety in this land, until slavery the child of despotism is laid prostrate and powerless at the feet of REPUBLICAN EQUALITY! Thank Heaven, there is a redeeming spirit in the land, and the time not far distant when, upon the wings of the wind, will be proclaimed 'LIBERTY AND EQUALITY' throughout the nation. With the Alton murder the deed of 'the West' has the West become identified. In the present posture of affairs, the commencement of 'FREEDOM'S ECHO' has been contemplated. It will maintain the equal and inalienable rights of all men will plead for the innocent, but oppressed and down-trodden slave will support Republican freedom assert the right of free discussion of trial by jury the right to investigate truth, and follow the dictates of conscience.In commencing the publication of the Echo, we throw ourselves upon the charity of the friends of the enslaved, throughout the State. We ask your assistance and support with it we can commence and be sustained without it, our hands must falter.The Echo will be published by an association of gentlemen, and edited by J.C. BURNELL. It will be published weekly on a medium sheet, of good paper and new type, and issued to subscribers for $2 00 per annum, payable on the receipt of the first number. The type, press and materials are now ready, and we shall commence publication so soon as we can receive sufficient encouragement to warrant us in the undertaking. All letters on business, etc. may be directed (postage paid) to the Editor.    must the child of despotism     postage paid
