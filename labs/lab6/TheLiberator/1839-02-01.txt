       MR. EDITOR:Allow me, through the medium of your paper, one word of 'foreign interference,' with the approaching congressional election in District No. 4. It is the great battle-ground of liberty the Lexington of political action the spot where love for the slave first triumphed over love of party. Abolitionists, every eye is directed towards you! Both friends and oppressors of the slave are alike watching your conduct. Twice you have met the foe, and twice returned from the field unconquered. Another trial is to be had, another battle fought. The struggle will be great glorious. What shall be the result? Shall the banner you have unfurled, and which now floats freely in the breeze, be lowered? Shall it be struck to the foes of universal freedom, the apologists of southern slavery, the defenders of the 'domestic institution'? Never never! The Spartan band, that have rallied in its defence, will rally again. But they must not stand the assault alone. Every abolitionist must do his duty. If you have been bound in party cords, be bound no longer. If you have doubted the expediency of political action, doubt no longer. Slavery is supported by political action, and by political action alone can it be abolished. Do you love the slave? Prove it at the ballot-box. Strike for him, where the blow will take effect. As you value your character for consistency, as you value the cause in which you are engaged, vote for none but a sterling abolitionist one who has been tried, and not found wanting. You are attempting to roll onward the car of abolition; trig not its wheels by voting for Brooks or Parmenter. Remember at the polls the cry of the slave, his galling chains, and lacerated back. Fail not in the hour of trial. Abolitionists of No. 4, DO YOUR DUTY, stand firm for the slave, for truth, and for God.        ESSEX.     

              It will be seen, from the reports, that last Monday was made, as usual, dies non a lost day in legislation. From ADAMS to WISE from A to Z the eager agitators on abolition were at work with new propositions to provoke angry, alienating discussion between the North and South.As we passed through the House on Monday, Mr. ADAMS was up, mumbling over petitions reading and re-stating, from successive copies of the same printed petitions, (signed by different, probably fictitious names,) the same jargon from the abolition spinsters and others, which Congress has for years, upon reference and report from committees, and more recently by prompt and decisive votes of the House, directly refused to act on, because, as has been again and again declared, it has no constitutional right to do so, and because it is deemed inexpedient, if it had the right. The plan now adopted to get round the rule which lays abolition petitions on the table, and so prevent further waste of the time of the House, is that of pouring in annoying petitions, praying the House to rescind the rule itself. Upon all these, the scheme is to raise debate, and press the subject, out of which dissension between the members of the different sections of our country is first to be produced, and then extended to the people themselves in those sections.Mr. WISE took precedence of his venerable ally and fast friend in Whiggery in this new move.After this, Mr. CURTIS, the Federal member from the city of New York, opened a volume of petitions; the first praying for the rescinding of Mr. Atherton's resolutions, that the floodgates of abolition fanaticism and fury may be again let loose in the House; and secondly, for the recognition of the negro Republic of Hayti, and having intimate relations negotiated with it, by way of encouraging the blacks of the South to rise upon the whites, and drench the South in servile war and a St. Domingo massacre.Mr. HEMAN ALLEN (the defeated Federal representative of Vermont, for whose sake Mr. Smith, the member elect, was cheated out of his return. in the first election, by the Federal officers) followed suit to Mr. Curtis. His budget implored Congress for amalgamation of black and white upon a great and small scale. His suing was mostly from females. In the first place, it was desired that the heroes of Hayti should be put upon the footing of the most favored people; then, that no State should be let into the Union that would not put the people of color into a condition to amalgamate by abolishing all distinctions; and, finally, they prayed that the District of Columbia might be made a place for the general blending of races, by abolishing at once all distinctions within the ten miles square.Massachusetts then came down with a flood of similar excitation. Messrs. Fletcher, Briggs, Grennell, Cushing, Reed, Lincoln, Calhoun, Saltonstall, &c. &c. presented petitions. Mr. CUSHING, the man who gave his double bond to the abolitionists as the price of his election, signalized himself by a new movement. He drew up resolutions discussing the petitions brought in by him, and insisting that it was unconstitutional for Congress to decide, when a subject was sufficiently disputed in the body when it had been sufficiently deliberated or to determine a question; but that it was an absolute violation of the rights of the States, of the liberty of speech and petition, to lay a subject on the table after the House was satisfied that no good could come of further debating it. He therefore concludes his voluminous, argumentative resolutions, by declaring the vote of the House to lay the abolition petitions on the table, to be 'a violation of the rights of the States, whose official communication of said class it excludes from due and proper consideration; a violation of the right of petition inherent in the people of the United States, which it cancels and abridges, and a violation of the privilege of speech and of debate, [ ] appertaining to the members of this House, which it forecloses and abolishes.'From this we learn that if Congress does not consent to debate one subject forever, or as long as any one member is found to demand it, (and that a subject with which Congress has no right to interfere,) then all freedom of speech, discussion, and petition is at an end. On this point we differ from Mr. Cushing, and think his doctrine would produce the result he apprehends, by putting it in the power of one individual to enforce a gag law on the majority of Congress, compelling it, against its will, to discuss one subject eternally, to the exclusion of all others.Mr. ADAMS succeeded Mr. Cushing, and opened up new themes of indignity and insult to the House, out of the serpent eggs which he has always under his wings. Hear him:'Mr. Adams presented a memorial from sundry inhabitants of Boston, in the State of Massachusetts, asking Congress to remove the present seat of Government from the District of Columbia, to some point north, where the principles of the 'Declaration of Independence' are not treated as a 'mere rhetorical [ ].' After alluding to a memorial presented at the last session, from inhabitants of the District, in favor of the retrocession of the same to the States of Virginia and Maryland, but on which there had been no action, Mr. A. observed that the memorial now presented, would furnish an opportunity of considering so serious and important a subject. He wished the House to consider it as a proposition for a compromise. After some further remarks, which owing to the noise were inaudible, he moved its reference to a select committee, with instructions to consider the same, and report on the constitutional power of Congress to recede the District to the States from which it was taken. And on that motion, he demanded the yeas and nays.'Mr. Adams presented another memorial of a humorous character, asking the appointment of a 'committee on color,' to whom should be referred all office holders and members of Congress, for the examination of their respective pedigrees; said committee to report on the same, and in all cases where the parties shall be bound to have the least drop of colored blood in their veins, they shall be expelled from office and their places filled by persons of pure Anglo Saxon blood.'We recur to these proceedings, first, to show how Northern Whigery and Southern Whig leaders happily chime in with each other in the adoption of the same plans to disturb the peaceful relations among the States of the Confederacy, and overthrow by anarchy, the Democracy, which is founded in our present institutions as on a rock and secondly, to point the public eye to the undying malignity of Mr. ADAMS against the people of this country, for having withdrawn power from a family that never deserved it, and which feels that it can never be revenged but by the overthrow of the principles that brought them to their [ ]. The scandalous propositions of which he is the [ ] the contumacy of which he is guilty day after day in violation of order the continued effort he makes to provoke a feud in the chamber, which shall end in a permanent schism of the body possibly the secession of the Representatives of a great section of the Union from Congress all go to prove that this [ ]iniquity' would rejoice if he could see, before his dim eyes are closed, our happy Union involved in [ ] by a political, fanatical and servile war. Arising from such causes, a war among proud, spirited, and unyielding States, would be a war of extermination; [ ] such a war this heartless man would bring about, of his vindictive feelings were not prevented from spreading their contagion, by the refusal of the House to discuss the sectional question compromised in the adoption of the Constitution.  dies non                   colored    iniquity'

                 It is worthy of a moment's inquiry by the benevolent among us who still lend their support to the colonization scheme, why it is, that when meetings almost innumerable, and signally unanimous and impressive have been held for twenty years, to protest against the scheme, as prejudicial alike to their interests, to the welfare of the country and the hopes of the slave, there has never been, so far as we know, in all the free States, a single meeting of colored people in favor of the scheme. Surely, they are more interested in a right decision of the matter than any others. And he who should say they are not competent to inquire and judge wisely in the matter, needs only to attend one of their meetings on the subject, to blush for his own ignorance and prejudice.A great meeting of the kind was held in this city on the 8th of January, which cannot but be attended with important consequences. The proceedings were highly impressive and worthy of the occasion. The compressed report we give below will convey but a faint idea of the reality.The meeting was held in Broadway Hall.WILLIAM P. JOHNSON was elected President of the meeting, and Messrs. Z.S. Barbary, W.J. Hodges, Henry Davis and Samuel Hardenburgh, Vice-Presidents; Augustus Washington, James Fields, and Francis P. Graham acted as Secretaries. Prayer by the Rev. Timothy Eato objects of the meeting stated by the President.The following preamble and resolution were presented and supported by JAMES M'CUNZ SMITH, M.D.WHEREAS, we, the people of color, citizens of New York, feel and know that the American 'Colonization Society' is the source whence proceed most of the various proscriptions and oppressions under which we groan and suffer; and believing that the most efficient remedy we can apply is, to reiterate the sentiments which we have at all times and places heretofore entertained and expressed thereby showing that our present opposition is not of late origin, but of as long standing as the existence of the scheme itself; and believing also, that where our opinions are known, the blighting influence of that unhallowed offspring of slavery cannot, so successfully, be exercised against us we, therefore, in solemn meeting assembled, do deliberately and unanimously enter our protest against the whole scheme, as anti-republican, anti-christian, and anti-humane.1. Resolved, That the first principle of republican government is, 'that all men are by nature free and equal,' and that the American Colonization Society, by denying that the colored man can rise, in this republic, to the full enjoyment of its institutions, denies the eternal principle of freedom and equality, and is anti-republican in its principles and tendency.Dr. Smith said,Mr. President, it is with a feeling of proud satisfaction that I look over this vast hall, filled to overflowing, with a representation of all that is respectable, talented and pious in our community, assembled to denounce the principles and measures of the American Colonization Society. And, although, sir, as an oppressed minority, it is our most prudent course to refrain from attracting public notoriety by distinct public meetings, yet there are occasions when this general rule must be violated. When men whom we never solicited, thrust their advice upon us; when men whom we never injured, load us with malignant abuse; when cold, crafty, and designing men, select us, the few and feeble, as the instruments by which they may strike a death-blow at the vitals of the Republic, then we are called upon, by our duty to ourselves, to those very men, and to our country, by all that is holy in principle and noble in patriotism to meet and lift our warning [ ] our fellow-citizens, so that if they listen the republic may be saved, and if they heed not, we may at least have the consolation of having warned them in season.That the Colonization Society gave us unasked advice, and has bitterly abused us for declining its proposals, are matters of history. But I must beg your indulgence while I endeavor to show that the same society, under the cloak of benevolence, in reality aims at the destruction of the first principle of republicanism. What is the Colonization Society? We are told it consists of all the good and great men in our land. That it may have a few good men I will not deny, but that it has many great men in its ranks is, alas! too true. Senators, Chief Justices, Members of Legislatures, Divines, Physicians and Lawyers, M. C's., D D's LL. D's., M.D's., Colonels, &c. &c., may be said to constitute this society. It is remarkable that its members are all of them titled men, or men grasping at titles.What object links together these men of title? It is not patriotism, for men of the most opposite political views belong to this society. It is not religion, for men of every creed and of no creed whatever, may be found in its ranks. What, then, unites these discordant elements, the men of peace, with the men of blood? What thing can be predicated of all of them? They are all aristocrats. They are the aristocracy of the republic.An aristocracy, sir, is always dangerous to a republic. A combination of its aristocracy, for any purpose whatever, has always been the death-knell of a republican government.For what purpose, is the aristocracy of our land united? At what object does the Colonization Society aim? They do not aim at evangelizing Africa, for then they would send out missionaries duly educated for the sacred work. And who would ever dream that Henry A. Wise would connect himself with a missionary society?Neither do they aim at the removal of the free people of color to Africa, because their efforts for this purpose have not been commensurate with their power. A few squatters in Georgia, with no influence beyond that State, were able to achieve the removal of 40,000 Cherokees against their will, and will it be said that all the great men in our whole country, after twenty years of united effort, could not remove more than a few thousand colored people to Liberia!What, then, is the real aim of the American Colonization Society? What has the society done? It has craftily instilled into the minds of the people the dogma that there is a natural inequality among the citizens of the republic. This is plain from the name of the society; for, to colonize being a voluntary act, to colonize another, is assuming a power over him which destroys the idea of equality between the parties.The society has further disseminated the idea of the natural inferiority of the colored people, by creating and keeping alive a feeling of prejudice or pity in regard to us. That this prejudice assumes the inferiority of the colored people, is sufficiently plain. Pity does the same: men do not pity their equals, but feel this emotion towards those who are, in some sense, their inferiors.And this feeling of pity towards us, colonizationists have diffused more widely than we are aware. They have spread it even in the abolition ranks. I repudiate this pity. We want no man's pity, we ask for our rights.Thus, sir, this society has widely disseminated the false doctrine, that there is a natural inequality among the citizens of this republic. This is evidently an attempt at subverting the principle that 'all men are by nature free and equal,' for if you destroy its universality, a principle is worthless.Let it not be supposed that the aristocracy who compose this society, having reduced us beneath the common level in public opinion, will stop their machinations. No, sir, they will soon seek other distinctive marks by which to separate themselves above the mass of the people, whom they have already almost cajoled out of the noblest principle of republicanism.To the people, then, let our appeal be made. Let us tell them, that in suffering us to be crushed on the plea of our inferiority, they yield the principle that secures their rights, and bend their necks to the iron yoke of the aristocracy.Mr. JAMES FIELDS offered the following resolutions:'2. Resolved, That the American Colonization Society, in aiming at the removal of the free people of color, does, directly, by that means, cast a shield around slavery, and is, therefore, the chief agent of the slaveholder in perpetuating that horrid system of robbery, oppression, debauchery and crime.'3. Resolved, That we regard the whole action and influence of the American Colonization Society as highly destructive to all true patriotism subversive of the bonds of social union, and a fitting agent in neutralizing the labors of philanthropy.'Mr. F. said, It is seldom that a portion of a people are called upon to testify to another portion of the same people, in defence of their right to remain in their native land. But such is our fortune at this time. And, sir, I remember that this is the 8th of January, and while in many places, the high-sounding song ascends in praise of the event which gives celebrity to this day, some of us whose kindred took a part in that event are assembled to claim our right to remain in our native land. In relation to the new scheme, of trying to excite our avarice, and fill our heads with notions of being merchants. and so on. I hope there is good sense and good feeling enough among us to assure all parties that, while we live we intend to remain in the land that gave us birth. Colonization is subversive of our social relations, sowing dissensions and jealousies among us, making us look on each other with coldness, and treat each other with disrespect, when colonization men are standing by, and exerts a counteracting influence upon the exertions of our real friends for our improvement.Rev. S.E. CORNISH rose, he said, not to make a speech, but to offer a resolution, though he would beg the indulgence of the meeting in a few remarks. I am, said he, a minister of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation, and I magnify mine office. I respect the ministers of Christ, when they are engaged in preaching the gospel fully; but I deprecate the prostitution of the ministry to worldly schemes or personal interests. God forbid that I should in any way cause a single individual to disesteem the ministry, or to undervalue the gospel. Rather let my right hand forget its cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.Mr. C. then offered his resolution, setting forth that a criminal hatred of color is the only ground on which there can be any pretext of necessity or propriety in the colonization scheme: and that the meddling of many of the clergy, in siding openly with oppressors and promoting this scheme, shows a time-serving spirit that justly forfeits the respect and confidence of every honest man. If we all, said Mr. C., could by any supernatural influence be turned white, all necessity for this scheme would be annihilated, and no man could offer a single reason why it should exist. Now, is not this hatred of color criminal? And ought not the watchmen on the walls of Zion to preach against this sin, and to point it out and rebuke it, when they see it carrying its blight and curse into the church? What does God say to the watchman? If he see the enemy coming, and warn not the people, their blood shall be required at the watchman's hand. Do these watchmen warn the people against the sin of color-hatred? No, they are dumb dogs, that will not bark. One of the most prominent features of colonization is, that it apologizes for slavery, extenuates its evils and the crime of slave-holders. Now, who are the principal agents of colonization? They are ministers, the principal pastors of our churches, the most influential of our D.D's.And they resort to false measures to carry out their plans. I heard two eminent ministers in this city make statements that were actually false, and which they knew, or might easily have known, were untrue. One of them was a story about an abolition agent at Norris-town, refusing to ride in the car with colored people. This clergyman told it with great positiveness, and dressed it up with all the particulars, and acted it all out in a very theatrical manner, and every word was a lie. Another statement was about a church in Connecticut with regard to its colored members, which the least pains might have satisfied him was all false. Thus, you see, that when a minister goes to do the devil's work, he is, of all men, the most awkward and ridiculous.A few years ago, a good minister in this city gave me some very severe remarks he had written against the Colonization Society, and wished me to take them to the New York Observer. The editors refused to told him, he was quite offended. But soon after wards, the witty colonizationists found out a way to get over this worthy brother's objections. They had a great meeting to form a society here, and appointed this same minister to present the constitution and make a speech. And he fell into the snare.I have called on these brethren, and asked why they wished us to go to Africa, and they say, because we cannot be elevated here. But why can we not enjoy our equal rights and privileges here? Because Christians cannot be brought to do their duty, and to act according to the commands of Christ. Is this not a sin, then? Yes. And is it found among your people? Yes. Have you preached against it? No. Why have you not? Because I knew it would do no good. So, here is a sin in the church which is too much for the gospel, and is more than proof against the Son of God! O, if Satan had got hold of their scheme, he would have vanquished the Lion of the tribe of Judah. But Satan did not know so much.Again, the same spirit that would drive us from our country, colonizes us in the churches. A few years ago, a leading colonization minister, who lately made a most extraordinary speech at Washington, invited me with a portion of my people, to his communion. It so happened that I came rather late to the house, and on looking around, I could not see any of my people. I thought it strange, but presently one of the elders came and invited me to a seat by the table, and there I found my people hid away under the pulpit! O, dear hearers, judge not the gospel of Christ by these men, but judge by other and better evidences of its power. We live in a day of apostacy, and time-serving, and worldly policy; and these evil principles have even crept into the pulpit. I mourn over it. I love the ministry, and I pray God to bring them back; but I boldly say that they have gone astray, and God is chastening the church for it. And if they are not brought to repentance, these evils will prevail, until the church is brought low, and then God will build it up again, of better men, who will walk according to the Golden Rule, that requires us to do unto others as we would have them do to us.I hope nothing I have said will lessen the reverence of any present for religion. It is the only thing worth living for, and we ought to esteem the gospel and its privileges above our chief joy. But while ministers are spending their efforts and prostituting their talents to secure their connection with the rich and the wicked, they justly forfeit the respect and confidence of all honest men.Rev. THEODORE S. WRIGHT offered a resolution, declaring that the modern dogma of colonization, that the establishment of trading colonies, composed, in a great measure, of impenitent individuals, is necessary for the propagation of the gospel, is against the truth, contrary to reason, history, and the doctrines of God, and ought to be opposed as a most dangerous heresy. Mr. W. said he must follow the impulse of his feelings, and express his gratitude to God, for the privilege of taking a part in this important meeting, the first primary assembly he had ever attended for the purpose of placing a veto on this Utopian scheme. He could regret that his name was not among those fathers and brethren who had early set the seal of their reprobation on these ruinous measures, which threaten destruction to the nation itself, and particularly to the two and a half millions to whom we are particularly bound. I had been led to fear of late, said Mr. W., that our people had been lulled to sleep, by supposing that the funeral obsequies of colonization had been performed. But, sir, the monster is not dead. It is often urged that colonization must be given up, because it cannot effect its purpose.It is true there is a physical impossibility in the way of its accomplishment. But I deny the conclusion, that therefore it is unnecessary for us to continue an opposition. Evils, complicated and awful, may come upon us in the prosecution of it, and therefore we ought to be always on the alert to meet, and oppose, and counteract, the ever-changing movements of our persecutors. The crusaders did not effect their object, but what vast miseries were produced by their chimerical schemes. The infidels of France did not effect their object, to annihilate christianity, put out the light of heaven, and blast the hopes of the world. But the evils which they brought upon France and Europe were awful. The country was deluged in blood, and France was made one vast slaughter-house. So, with regard to colonization, they cannot, blessed be God, they cannot and will not effect their cruel object, of driving two and a half millions of their own countrymen from their home and native land, to the sickly deserts of Africa. But they will do all they can, to destroy the spirit of liberty, to strengthen prejudice against us, to prevent our education, to impede our recovery of our political rights, by saying the more they do for us, the more we think it our home. And therefore we are called upon, every man, woman and child, in every place and at all times, to give our testimony against Colonization.Another thought. Of all the motives for Colonization, those that appeal to the piety of the church are the most effectual. Colonization is ready to assume all forms, and adopt all pretences, according to circumstances. But both South and North, it goes better under the name of pitying the children of Africa, and promoting the salvation of souls, than any other. Here at the North it offers the pretext of pitying the free people of color, because we never can rise here, nor enjoy our liberty if we had it; while at the same time it is as much opposed to slavery as the abolitionists, and wonders why there need to be any contention between the two societies. But at the South, the slave-holding Colonizationist brandishes his whip, and says it is necessary to send off these free negroes for the security of our institutions. They never have any idea of reaching the slaves, but the colonization organ is full of pity for poor Africa, and longs to send the gospel to poor Africa. The agent goes into the presbyteries and synods, or enters the parlors and sits by the side of the good ladies, and pities poor Africa, and perhaps sheds a tear or two, and says, 'Come, now, make your minister a live member of the Colonization Society, to help poor Africa.'Now, let us disabuse the white people of the false influences that are addressed to the piety of the church, and colonization is dead. There is not force enough in the politicians to do any thing effectual. It is the praying men and women that support this system. If we could disabuse the good people of the idea that they are helping to Christianize Africa, and abolish the slave trade, by colonization, they would turn all their power against the scheme. For one, I abhor the colonization doctrine, not merely or mainly because I am a colored American, and my sympathies are with the down trodden, but chiefly and specially because I am a Christian, and a minister, and wo is me if I do not stand by the gospel; and most of all, because I love the cause of missions, and I see this colonization heresy hanging a millstone about that holy cause. Sir, the idea of evangelizing the world by men who have no grace in their own hearts, is HERESY, next in atrocity to the heresy of Mahomet. The scheme is subversive of missions, and must be abandoned before the cause of missions can triumph. People often ask us, 'where is your pity for poor Africa, and your zeal for the spread of the gospel, when you oppose colonization?' I answer, it is because we love the cause of missions, and because we love Africa, that we oppose this scheme. We wish the gospel to go by the hands of pure-hearted men, who have themselves felt its power and can exhibit its spirit. You know, sir, who they are that have gone to Africa. Many of them our brethren, indeed, whom we love and pity; but in the unfavorable circumstances under which they have lived, not fitted to become missionaries of the cross. No, sir, I say it boldly, that the colonization missionaries are not the missionaries of Christ. If you have such a love for poor bleeding Africa, why not send her men whom Christ has commissioned to preach the gospel? The other day, I was at Clinton, and the President of the College was trying to defend colonization. He said that when he recollected the colony at Jamestown, and the colony at Plymouth, and saw what they had done in two hundred years, he could not oppose colonization. I replied, see what they have done indeed! Where are the aborigines, the people to whom they came as missionaries? Our influence in Africa would be the same with yours here. We are men, like you, and if we go to Africa, we might convert the natives as you have converted the natives in America. And is there any religion in this?Sir, I believe, if the truth on this subject could go to the churches throughout the land, they would abandon the scheme, and colonization would die.Mr. THOMAS VAN RAENSLAER, in seconding Mr. Wright's resolution, wished to take the opportunity of retracting an error of his own, which he had recently discovered. He had until quite lately, been willing to a harmless [ ], that it should be let alone, as them do it. But he was now convinced that it was evil, and only evil, and that we are bound to do every thing in our power to counteract it, and that all they have done in twenty years will have to be undone, before the proper impression can be made upon the public mind.Mr. PHILIP A. BELL presented some very pointed resolutions, which will be found below. In supporting them, he said the colonizationists have tried every thing to get us into their power. They have tried to cajole us, and tried to flatter us, and tried to ridicule us, and tried to intimidate and to force us, to fall in with their designs. And now they have undertaken to bribe and buy us. They appeal to our avarice. They say, these colored people are just like other men; put money in their purse, and see how that will answer. Let them see it. Let them find that we cannot be bought, that we are freemen and mean to be free, and that we seek no such aid as they would give 'protection, such as vultures give to lambs, covering and devouring them.' These people care not where we go, to Liberia, or to the devil, if we will only go away. 'Tis but the old song set to a new tune. We tell them NO. We cannot swallow the gilded pill.'8. Resolved, That the last new project of the American Colonizationists, put forth under the plea of rendering assistance to the man of color, by purchasing ships and placing them in the possession of colored men, to be paid for by the transportation of their brethren to Africa, thereby appealing to our avarice, is unworthy our notice, and should therefore be treated with the contempt it merits, as a 'weak device of our enemies.''9. Resolved, That our sympathies for the slave, the love we bear our native land, our respect and veneration for the institutions and government of our country, are so many cords which bind us to our home, the soil of our birth, which has been wet by the tears and fertilized by the blood of our ancestors; and from which, while life lasts, in spite of the 'oppressor's wrongs,' we will never be seduced or driven, but abiding by principle, and placing our trust in the 'Lord of Hosts.' we will tell the white Americans that their country shall be our country we will be governed by the same laws, and worship at the same altar where they live we will live, where they die there will we be buried, and our graves shall remain as monuments of our suffering and triumph, or of our failure and their disgrace.'These resolutions, sir, only reiterate what we have from the first commencement of the colonization enterprise, held and expressed. But it is fitting that it should go forth again and again, till the hills echo, and the very seas send back the strength of our abhorrence of the scheme. Do not our hearts bleed with sympathy for the two and a half millions of our enslaved brethren? Leaving color out of the question, as Americans merely, shall we leave them in the fangs of the oppressor? No; here will we stand, for our country and our countrymen, until, by moral power, we shall see it a dishonor removed, and their injuries redressed, and rights conceded. And even now, we can say, 'America, with all thy faults, I love thee still.' I have a feeling of attachment to my native land, which the wilds of Africa, even though they were blooming with all the luxuries of colonization poetry, could never excite. We respect the institutions of our country; why should we be forced or cajoled away? We are satisfied here, for though oppressed now, we still hope for better days.'Tis principle that actuates in our opposition to this scheme. It is not opposition for opposition's sake, but principle, moral, political, and religious principle. Here will we take our stand. And we will tell the white Americans, that their country is and shall be our country, we will be governed by the same laws, and abide by the same institutions, which we, like them, revere and honor, and will worship the same God at the same altar. We may be driven to build on the barren sands, but we will make our offerings on the altar of our childhood. And if the yoke of oppression and cruelty crushes us to the earth, our graves shall remain the monument of our sufferings and of their dishonor. But if these oppressions and wrongs are removed, by the prevalence of justice and humanity, our graves shall stand as the tokens of our triumph over prejudice and wrongMr. JOHN B. STEWARD, in seconding the resolutions, remarked that the colonization scheme is nothing less or more than a piece of Machiavellian policy, for the purpose of drawing off the free people of color from the North, to strengthen the hands of the slaveholders of the South. We are not hostile to the spread of the gospel, we wish it to go to earth's remotest bounds, but we reject the means pointed out by colonization, not will we be influenced, by colonization delusions, to waste our devoted lives on Afric'a sands, while the fertile fields of the South are far more promising.Mr. PETER VOGELSANG offered resolutions expressive of entire confidence in the principles and measures of the Anti-Slavery Society, and commending it to the support of all. He said it might seem a work of supererogation to make this expression; but it must be borne in mind, that the mere holding of an opinion, without a true sense of its importance, and a corresponding course of action, is apt to render us lethargic in maintaining the sentiment itself. He spoke of the Protean shapes of colonization. At the South, it pacifies the conscience of the slaveholder, and holds out the idea that his property will be rendered more secure by the removal of the free people of color, of whom their president Clay said, they 'hold the middle ground between the slaveholder and the slave, corrupting both.' In the Middle States, it appeals to the cupidity of the merchant, with the idea of bags of coffee and cases of gold dust. In the North, it is full of pity for much injured Africa. He trusted that none would be lulled to sleep by their flatteries. None of us, said he, would go, even if they promised to make us kings in Guines I we are Americans, and will remain such. If a man has friends or funds to help us into business, which we like, we might gladly avail ourselves of it. But to attempt to coerce us to the enjoyment of benefits which we do not choose, constitutes the essence of tyranny.  benevolent           at all times and places in solemn meeting assembled, against the whole scheme, as anti-republican, anti-christian, and anti-humane.                                                            because because         is unworthy our notice,   while life lasts, never be seduced or driven,           

       The fifth Anniversary of the Vermont Anti-Slavery Society, by divine permission, will be holden at Middlebury, on the 20th, 21st and probably 22d of February next. A preliminary discourse will be given on the preceding evening, Tuesday the 19th, by the Rev. O. Scott of Lowell, Mass. Business meeting of the Society will commence on the first day of the session, at 9 o'clock, and public exercises at 11 o'clock, A.M.All Anti-Slavery Societies, or associations, in the State are requested to send one or more delegates.      

            In accordance with notice given, a large meeting of the oppressed Americans assembled, on the evening of the 7th inst., at the Lutheran Church, (St. Paul,) to hear the report of the committee appointed at a prior meeting, in relation to Judge Wilkinson's new project of expatriation. The committee, consisting of James Cornish, Robert Purvis, James Needham, R.B. Ayres, and S.H. Gloucester, reported the following, which were adopted:Whereas, we have learned with deep indignation, that proposals have been made, and received the sanction and recommendation of several 'Reverend' and 'Honorable' gentlemen, for purchasing or building vessels to trade between the United States and the colonies of the American Colonization Society in Africa; and that said vessels, when purchased or builded, are to be manned and navigated by colored men, who are to become owners of the same in ten years, by paying such sum or sums as may be stipulated by their builders or contractors.And whereas, if we had no other objection to the above-mentioned plan of these philanthropic gentlemen, a knowledge of the general estimation in which they have held the rights and interest of colored Americans, would imperiously admonish us to view with distrust such proposals coming from them. The author of this new plan of benevolence (the Honorable Judge Wilkinson, late of Florida,) is one of those who has been, and is yet associated, with these Reverend recommenders in the support and prosecution of measures which aim at the banishment of all of us (who do not wear the fetters of personal slavery) from the land of our birth, the graves of our fathers, and the homes of our affections.But we have other and stronger objections:1st. We object to the plan because it is too proscriptive in its conditions; it proposes that the trade of the contemplated vessels shall be exclusively with the American colonies in Africa, thereby depriving the adventurers in it of the lucrative trade of other portions of the world, and bringing the whole concern under the immediate patronage and control of the American Colonization Society.2d. We object to it because it proposes as a part of the articles to be exported, or rather transported, FREE AMERICAN CITIZENS; who are to be deprived of 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' in their native land, and expatriated to a land of heathen darkness, to encounter all the miseries of sorrow and pestilance and in most cases down in ...3d. We object to it because it would make us auxiliary to the American Colonization Society, instruments in its hands in carrying out its misanthropic and unchristian measures, and make us participants in exiling our people to the coast of Africa.4th. And above all we object to it because we can see through the deceptive veil its authors have thrown over it, and discover in it all the deformities of colonization; that it is but another to be added to the many deceitful machinations of colonizationists, to ingratiate their nefarious schemes into public favor, and delude the unwary victims of their prejudice and avarice into their expatriating plans. We believe that an acquiescence on our part in the plan proposed by Judge Wilkinson, would be a sacrifice of principle, adverse to our interest, a high-handed act of apostacy, and make us recreants to the common cause of our oppressed people, and the miserable dupes of colonization hate and prejudice.Therefore, Resolved, That our sentiments, as expressed (in regard to colonization) in 1817, remain yet unimpaired by time or circumstances, and that no delusive phantoms, whether they present themselves in the shape of commercial, political, or pecuniary advantages, shall induce us to swerve from them.Resolved, That we view Judge Wilkinson's plan, as a last resort to induce colored Americans to revoke the determination so often expressed, and so firmly maintained by them, to resist colonization in any shape.Resolved, That the colored man who for the sake of any gain (held out in the aforesaid plan,) would forsake the principles and interest of his people to join in the measures of the Colonization Society as an adventurer in this new scheme, is recreant to their happiness, a miserable apostate, who, although deserving our indignation, should receive only our pity and contempt.Resolved, That if Judge Wilkinson and his associates are really anxious that any portion of our people should engage in a commercial enterprise, if they will supply half the sum proposed to buy us to the Colonization Society, and leave us free to trade, unshackled by colonization rule, we pledge ourselves to prove worthy of and grateful for the favor.Resolved, That ministers of the gospel would be more suitably employed, in attending to the spiritual affairs of the church, and purging it from the sin of slavery as sustained in the persons of some of its professing members, than in recommending or engaging in any commercial pursuits for the purpose of transporting a portion of American citizens to Africa.The following were afterwards offered and adopted:Resolved, That that man who asserts that we are willing to go to Africa, if the means were provided, is (in the language of that distinguished patriot and advocate of human freedom, Daniel O'Connell, in reference to a certain pseudo Quaker philanthropist) 'a liar to the full extent and meaning of the term.'Resolved, That our confidence is full, plenary, and unabated in the principles and measures of the abolitionists, and that in them (jointly with our own efforts,) we rely for the attainment of those rights to which we are entitled by the Creator of all men.Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be published in the Pennsylvania Freeman, and all other papers friendly to the cause of human rights. Adjourned.                              certain pseudo Quaker philanthropist        JAMES McCRUMMELL, Chairman. Chairman.     JAMES M. WHITE,GEO W. COLLINS,Assistants.  Assistants.  John L.

       At the quarterly meeting of the New England Temperance Society, held in the Baptist Church, Belknap st. on the 21st inst. it wasResolved, That the meeting be adjourned from one colored church to another for four successive weeks, for discussion on Temperance, provided such places can be obtained by the Committee.The first meeting will be held in Zion's Church, Cambridge st, on Monday evening, Feb. 4th, at 7 o'clock. Friends of temperance, and others interested, are invited to take part in the discussion.         J.C. REMAN, President President   J.F. HILTON, Secretary.  Secretary.   

 The Colonization Herald gave ominous warning of the grand discomfiture of Northern abolitionism, by the onslaught of Ralph R. Gurley and Elliott Cresson. It seems that the latter has fallen in with some of Joseph Tracy's disciples up in Vermont, who have been pining so long in the uncongenial atmosphere of abolitionism, that the bare sight of a pro-slavery Quaker has thrown them into ecstacies, and, in the dearth and famine of colonization which prevails among the Green Mountains, even Elliott Cresson is bailed by these martys to pro-slavery as 'a God-send.' Penn. Freeman.Congruity. Henry A. Wise, fresh from fighting the battles of slavery in the Capitol, made a speech, eulogistic of colonization as a Southern society, and as a friend of Southern institutions, and Bethune followed in approbation of the speech of the Virginian. Ibid.Reciprocal. The correspondent of the Journal of Commerce states that Wise talked of putting down the abolitionists with 'cold steel and Dupont's best gunpowder!' and yet be tells us that this speech was 'ELOQUENTLY RECIPROCATED BY THE Rev. Dr. BETHUNE.' Comment is unnecessary. Ibid.   a God-send.' Penn. Freeman.   Congruity. Ibid.   Reciprocal. Ibid.   

       FRIEND GARRISON:I read with much surprise a communication in your paper of the 4th inst. purporting to be the production of Mr. Folsom, Editor of the Gospel Witness, etc. How well the sentiments contained in that article will chime with the title which Mr. F. has selected for his paper, I leave those who know what the Gospel is, to decide. It is matter of surprise to me that a man, who inculcates love to all mankind as a sacred duty enjoined upon every individual, should utter sentiments so diametrically opposed to the exercise of such love. I can assure Mr. F. if God does not love the black man much better than he does, He will not be the Saviour of all men. The following thoughts, elicited by the article above referred to, are submitted for publication in the Liberator, if you deem them worthy of publicity.    he   

                      If the legislators of the South had consulted together how they could best render themselves ridiculous upon the subject of the abolition of slavery, they could not have hit upon a scheme more effectual than that which they are at present pursuing. Let us give a few specimens of the cool legislative wisdom with which they handle the subject. North Carolina shall furnish the first.In the Senate of that State, a Mr. Morehead, who represents the county of Guilford, in which there are a large number of Quakers, who, as it is well known, always have made it a part of their religion to hold no slaves, and to exert themselves for the abolition of slavery, at the request of these Quaker constituents of his, presented the following petition:'PETITION, from our yearly meeting of the Society of Friends, held at New Garden, Guilford county, N.C., in the 11th month, 1838, to the ensuing General Assembly.'We entreat you to legislate for the termination of slavery in this State.'Signed by direction of the meeting,             'by NATHAN MENDENHALL, Clerk.'   The memorial was certainly sufficiently unexceptionable in its style and phraseology; and as these Quakers have been long settled in North Carolina, in all probability similar petitions have been presented to the Legislature of that State often before. But under existing circumstances, the venerable Senators thought it necessary that a scene should be enacted. Upon offering the petition, Mr. Morehead stated that he felt bound to present it, as he had been requested to do so by a large and respectable portion of his constituents; but to show how far it was from his intention or desire to favor the object of the abolitionists, he would state that he was probably the largest slave-holder in that section of the country, and could not be so blind to his own interests, as to give countenance to their designs.Not satisfied with this statement, honorable Senators of both parties immediately put themselves into a state of great excitement, real or apparent, and both administration and opposition Senators emphatically declared it was a subject they would not entertain on that floor. A certain Mr. Edwards, according to a North Carolina paper, from which we derive our information, made some very excellent remarks, which he concluded by hoping the Senate would not be compelled to vote on the question; he should be loth to act, he could not trust himself to think upon it: but if required to do so, he should unhesitatingly vote against entertaining the subject. He hoped, however, the petition would be withdrawn. The Senator from Guilford, he said, had discharged his duty ably, and he would now respectfully ask him to withdraw the petition.Whereupon, up rose Mr. Morehead, the presenter of the petition, and remarked that as the gentleman from Warren believed he had discharged his duty, and requested him to withdraw the memorial, he would do so.So the petition was withdrawn, and the Senate forth-with unanimously resolved that no notice should be taken of the subject on the Journal!Those who have read Oliver Twist, will perhaps be reminded by this scene in the North Carolina Senate, of the terrible hubbub produced in the board of parish overseers, when the half starved Oliver had the audacity to ask for more.'Let us now proceed to South Carolina. We gave, the other day, the resolutions adopted by the Legislature of that State touching the controversy between Georgia and Maine. Those resolutions, not, however, precisely in the form in which they passed, were proposed by a Mr. Rhett, the brother of that Robert Barnwell Rhett, who offered a resolution at the last session of Congress, for a dissolution of the Union...'I truly do no believe, Mr. President, that in the security of their own good consciences, our people are aware how they are held up to the civilized world, and in what base colors they are painted. Let gentlemen but listen to a few of the sentiments that are abroad concerning us, as Slaveholders, and I cannot think they will hesitate a single moment, in their conviction, that if we value our characters, as christians, as philanthropists, nay, as honest men and gentlemen, we cannot delay a moment to rebuke this spirit. (Mr. R. here read extracts from Abolition papers.)'These, Mr. President, are the sentiments which now prevail in reference to us, almost every where, but within our own borders. And whence has this character of us been circulated! Who are the base calumniators that have thus volunteered to testify against us before the world? Our brethren of the North they who are bound to us in the strictest bonds of amity, and who, from their close and intimate connection with us, as one people, are supposed by other nations best qualified to speak knowingly. Yes, Mr. President, there is not a vile calumny circulated to our injury, from the vulgar abuse of Daniel O'Connel, down to the sickly pulling of every foreign professor of exclusive philanthropy, but our brethren of the Northern States are pointed out as the attestors and witnesses thereof. And there is no imputation on us so base or degrading, but hosts of them are made, to volunteer their testimony, as far as that is worth, to our degradation and ruin. And yet these are the people for whom, and from brotherly regard for whom, we are adjured by all that is sacred in the holy bonds of our Union not to offend or stir by any action on our part. That Union, I trust will yet long endure; but not for any thing they may do to preserve it. If we wish to preserve it in any form worth our acceptance or respect, it must be by doing as we now propose to do by rising as one man in defence of its principles and provisions; and not by remaining either timidly or over cautiously at rest, until this dreadful cloud of calumny, shame, and degradation, is permitted to overwhelm us; and, (instead of standing forth to the world, as we know ourselves entitled to do, as men of philanthropy and humanity) as a people, who have claims to the character of civilized and christian we shall be falsely pointed at and branded as the oppressors of mankind, and the enemies of our race.'We know, that in the bosoms of our families and institutions the holy flame of religion and christian philanthropy is cherished as warmly and devotedly as the frailties of our nature will permit. We know, so far from meriting the base calumnies on us and ours, so industriously circulated by our brethren of the non-slaveholding States, that those whom God, in his wisdom, has entrusted to our care, are protected, clothed, and fed, with that care and kindness which we show to our children and friends. We know, that they are (so far as is consistent with their condition,) watched over in their youth, and protected in their age. We know that the station which has been assigned them by Providence, amongst us, has been better, a thousand fold, for them than their race has ever enjoyed in the land of their forefathers. And we most assuredly are convinced, that any serious change of that condition, would result in more desolation and ruin to them than we could possibly suffer from it. We know, that, if the experience of all ages and climates be worth any thing, as authority, that they are a race incapable of civilized freedom; and that the only choice which their nature as men permits to them, is between the barbarous and unbridled freedom of savage life, and civilized servitude, of which our own is the mildest form.'Knowing and feeling all these things, how can we longer be content to sit as we now do, under the rebuke of the world; and that rebuke and reproach so undeservedly heaped on us; all resting on the false testimony of those who are nearest allied to us in a National bond and who should have been the first, (did they act according to any sense of that amity and brotherly kindness so much our due,) to repel these imputations, and sustain us in the justice of our cause.'All this is very plausible and very pathetic, how true it may be, is another question. But the ridiculous part of the affair consists in the remedy which Mr. Rhett proposes for the evils which he so eloquently describes. It will be seen that the orator calls upon his compatriots 'to rise as one man,' for the purpose of vindicating 'their characters as christians, philanthropists, nay, as honest men, and gentlemen;' for the purpose 'of standing forth to the world, as they know themselves entitled to do, as men of philanthropy and humanity;' and of proving that in the bosoms of their families, the holy name of christian love is cherished as warmly and devotedly as the frailties of our nature will admit.' These are the purposes which Mr. Rhett desires to accomplish; the means to which he would resort for their accomplishment will appear by the following extract from his oration:'I avow, distinctly, that my object is not only to make a constitutional question: I mean to avail myself of the position which Georgia has so nobly assumed, to bring to an issue the controversy which the abolitionists have so long been seeking, and pressing on us. I have labored and reflected on the question long, and with a profound impression of its importance; and it seems to me (with all deference for the opinions of those who may differ from me, I speak it,) that now is our time.The State of Georgia has clearly the right of the whole controversy, as now presented. Two of these fanatics, impelled by their insolent and diabolical notions of philanthropy, have wantonly committed within her borders, a deed which, if duly proved upon them, (and we are informed the evidence is almost unquestionable,) amounts to a felony. On this felonious transaction, the Grand Jury of the county have found a 'true bill;' and under that bill, the Governor of Georgia, by the direction of her Legislature, has demanded, according to the provisions of the constitution, the delinquents for trial. It only, therefore, remains for the State of Maine to perform her necessary and common duty, as a member of our Union, to bring these culprits to condign punishment.If she acquiesces in this just and rightful demand, they will then be made to suffer the penalty of the offence, and abolition will receive a lesson that will be long and deeply remembered a check, which will, at the same time, rouse the slaveholding States from their too long inaction, and teach those who have so recklessly embarked in their crusade of injustice and false philanthropy against their countrymen, to pause and reflect on the utter folly and iniquity of it, however sacred it might seem to them, under the gloss of a false and morbid religion.'So according to Mr. Rhett, the true means of establishing the character of the South, for 'christianity,' 'philanthropy' and 'humanity,' the true means to refute all the calumnies of the abolitionists, and to satisfy the world that slavery is an excellent institution, and that the slaves of the South, are 'clothed, fed and protected with the care and kindness which the people of the South show to their children and their friends,' the true means to establish and prove all this is, to catch and hang two northern abolitionists, on the charge of having aided a slave to escape from his master! This method of demonstration is certainly very compendious; but whether, out of South Carolina, it would prove perfectly satisfactory, is perhaps a little doubtful.We now come to the State of Alabama. The following amusing account of an abolition scene in the Legislature of that State, is from the Tuscaloosa Intelligencer:'EXCITEMENT IN THE HOUSE. The lower House of the Legislature, on Tuesday last, made the State a new year's present of its powers of enlightenment upon the inflammatory subject of abolition as connected with party politics. The excitement arose from the last resolution of the amendment of Mr. Payne of Sumter, to Judge Smith's resolutions, which resolution proposed a recommendation of the course of he administration, on the ground of its southern policy and principles, past and present. The amendment, Mr. Baldwin of Montgomery moved to lay upon the table. Mr. Payne went into a defence, at some length, of his amendment, and in the course of his remarks, took occasion to make some impassioned and very animated observations upon the league, which he supposed to have been formed between the northern Whigs and abolitionists, and expressed deep mortification, profound humiliation, at the course of the southern politicians who were, in his opinion, sustaining those accursed fanatics, by their support of a Whig candidate for the Presidency. The speech of Mr. Payne was made under much apparent excitement, and was, in its matter, sufficiently fiery. Mr. Hillard of Montgomery followed in the debate, and avowing himself to be entirely southern in his feelings, interests, partialities, and even prejudices, yet could not support Mr. Van Buren, because such support was inconsistent with every view he was enabled to take of southern interests. He was a State Rights man, and had ever been such, and was always, as such, opposed to the late and present Administrations. He utterly denied any shadow of propriety in the application of abolition principles or connections to him, or the Whig party in the South. Mr. Payne rejoined and said that the advice of Junius was never to deny any thing for fear of suspicion; it, also, was an old saying that the cap sat uneasily upon the head it fit; if it fit the gentleman, he was welcome to wear it. He said that it was not his intention to have made any application to any one in the House, but the denial of the gentleman was suspicious, and if Junius was to be believed, indicated the truth of what it denied.Mr. Porter, of Tuscaloosa, rose under great excitement. He spoke with much earnestness and warmth in repudiation of the idea that there existed the slightest affiliation between southern Whigs and the desperadoes at the North, who were carrying on their nefarious designs against the South. He could not remain silent when insinuations were made implicating him, a southern man, in every interest, and feeling, and aspiration with a wife and children in the South, who would be affected by the torch and knife of the assassins which the northern incendiaries would place in the hands of our servile population when he, holding these miscreants as he did, in utter abhorrence was suspected of giving them countenance, or in any manner lending them aid. He spurned from him the insinuations with the loftiest and most indignant scorn. He hurled it back to the source whence it came. He averred that instead of the Whigs coalescing with the abolitionists the Democratic party of the North has coalesced. Mr. Payne rose also greatly excited. He said that originally he meant nothing personal to any member, but now as gentlemen seemed so morbidly sensitive on the subject, he would say that there were men in the South aye, continued Mr. P. upon this floor who'Order was called by the chair, which remarked that the rules of the House forbade any gentleman from making personal reflections upon members.Mr. Payne. 'If the Sergeant at Arms can keep me in order let him do it.' The Chair repeated the requisition, and Mr. P. announced his acquiescence, and shortly after took his sent.Mr. Hillard, Mr. Shields, Mr. Shortridge, Mr. Wright of Perry, and Mr. Young, the latter with the most powerful and effective eloquence, spoke upon the question. Mr. Moore of Marengo, made a speech characterised by its temper and pleasantry, which had considerable effect in restoring good humor.Judge Smith also spoke. The storm which looked, at one time, a little threatening, subsided as storms generally do about sun set. We trust that no such inflammatory matter will be again thrown into the House.'These mutual accusations of being in secret league with the abolitionists, are not confined to the Alabama Legislature. The newspapers, the legislative debates, and the speeches of the southern members of Congress are full of it. Each party accuses the other of secretly plotting with northern 'incendiaries and desperadoes;' and a candid man, taking all the charges and allegations on both sides into the account, would be apt to come to the conclusion that about all the leading politicians of the South, of all parties, and indeed the great mass of the southern population, were abolitionists at heart, but afraid to own it! Doubtless it is far from the intention of our southern friends to convey any such impressions. Indeed, they tell us every now and then that upon this subject, the South is united as one man. But certainly the freedom and frequency with which they charge each other with being leagued with the abolitionists, does not seem to square very well with that assertion.  scene   would not he could not trust himself to think upon it:             brethren brethren brotherly   brethren   that all   true purposes means         protected satisfactory,   scene Tuscaloosa Intelligencer:     him, he,

 JOHN QUINCY ADAMS. This gentleman, in presenting some anti-slavery petitions to Congress on the 21st ultimo, took occasion (after stating that he was continually receiving letters threatening him with assassination) 'distinctly to say to the House, to the country, and to the world, that if the question of the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia were to be put this day, HE WOULD VOTE AGAINST IT.' This declaration nips in the bud the hopes of many abolitionists, respecting the future course of Mr. Adams on the floor of Congress. The loss of the right of petition is merely a consequence growing out of the existence of slavery in the District of Columbia. Mr. Adams has been zealous in protesting against an EFFECT, and yet declares that he is resolved not to strike at the CAUSE! This is indeed to labor in vain, and to spend one's strength for nought. What political foresight and consistency! We are glad to perceive that Mr. Adams does not deny that Congress has the constitutional power to abolish slavery in the District. It is upon the altar of EXPEDIENCY that he is disposed to immolate the inalienable rights of the victims of slavery groaning out a miserable existence within the 'ten miles square.' We lament that it is so. We shall try to copy his remarks into our next paper.     

       PEACE 'tis a blessed word Blessed are the sons of peace,Who following their ascended Lord, From strife and wrangling cease.Peace reigns in heaven supreme It makes that kingdom loveAnd it will be the noblest theme Of all who reign above.Peace Jesus sought to make, When from the skies he came;And who a brother's life can take, Yet love his holy name?The men of peace will ne'er Approve of battles foughtOr in the martial deep appear, With pride and folly fraught.Orphans and widows made, With none their pains to shareBy men who bloody oceans wade An earthly crown to wear.Will kindle deep disgust Within his peaceful breast,Who puts in Heaven his only trust, And blessing man is blest.Great God, speed on the day When all will follow peaceWhen brothers will not brothers slay, And wars and fightings cease.                            his           D.C.C.

 ELOQUENCE. The meeting of the State Anti-Slavery Society, which was held in the House of Representatives on the evening of the 24th ult. was thronged to excess. It so happened that we were not present; but we have heard the proceedings described as remarkably interesting. The speech of Wendell Phillips an extempore effort is on all hands conceded to have been one of the most finished and powerful attempts at oratory ever listened by any public assembly. He drew a striking contrast between the past and the present, and came down with annihilating effect upon that matchless imposture, the colonization scheme.     

          And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep.'    Oh! the world from its trance is awaking, With the spring of regenerate youth;And the error-freed people are slaking Their thirst at the fountain of truth.Oh! the canker-worm, custom, was eating Its way through the veins of the age,Till man, like a wild-bird, seemed beating His breast on the bars of his cage.Hark! a voice to the nations hath spoken, In tones that have startled the world.'Let the dark chain of error be broken Let LIBERTY'S flag be unfurled!'For time and progressive opinion Shall conquer where cohorts shall fail,And Freedom assert her dominion Hail Freedom all hail!The war-fiends, sin-spotted and gory, No longer shall gorge on mankind,For the Sun of a new day of glory Flames far o'er the empire of mind.Man's spirit is quickly surmounting The vapor that veiled it in night,And now like a long pent up fountain, Its waters are gushing to light.From the heavens dark shadows are clearing, From the earth a thick mist rolls away,And the rainbow of hope re-appearing, Brightens the DAY, the DAY.Ye helots shrink back now in terror, To the dens where LOST tyranny liesLight dawns on the long night of error, The PHAROS of Freedom will rise.

            Extracts from the Seventh Annual Report of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society.        Since the standard of emancipation was first flung out to the breeze, no local election in this country has excited so intense and wide an interest as that which is now pending in old Middlesex. It not only happens that the rival political parties are nearly balanced, so that a very small corps du reserve can prevent a choice; but it also happens that a large portion of the electoral strength in the District belongs to the abolitionists, who, it is estimated, if true to their principles, might easily cast some twelve or fifteen hundred votes. Holding, then, in their hands, the balance of power overwhelmingly, for them to allow any but a tried, undoubted friend of immediate emancipation to succeed, would be a burning disgrace to themselves, and make political abolition a hissing and a proverb. How faithfully they have withstood all attempts to put them in party traces, with what ease they have twice defeated an election, who that 'hath ears to hear,' and eyes to see, has not heard and witnessed? Another trial is to be made on the first Monday in February, the same obnoxious candidates being in nomination. On the first trial there were more than 300, on the second more than 600 scattering votes cast. On the third, it is confidently expected the number will be greatly augmented and so on, until one or both of the rival parties shall consult the rights of the North, and the claims of bleeding humanity, in nominating a suitable candidate.If Messrs. Brooks and Parmenter had been avowedly hostile to the anti-slavery cause. a much stronger opposition would have been brought out against them. But every effort was made by their partisans, to induce the abolition electors to believe that they were 'good men and true,' the fast friends of immediate emancipation. Some of the leading whig organs, conspicuous, for the last five years, for their unmitigated opposition to our principles and measures, gravely expressed their astonishment, that any fault should be found with the abolitionism of Nathan Brooks! It was pronounced to be of a genuine stamp, ultra even to the letting down of the heavens, if justice were only done! These story-tellers were too doltish to perceive, that their very endorsement of Mr. B's anti-slavery character furnished strong circumstantial, not to say positive evidence of its unsoundness. In declaring his coin to be pure gold, they proved it to be counterfeit. On the other hand, the papers friendly to William Parmenter asserted, that the spirit of his abolitionism was at least 100 per cent. better than that of Mr. Brooks! These strong but deceptive representations, joined to that sorcery-spell of party, from which so few of the people have been able wholly to emancipate themselves doubtless induced a number of abolition voters, whose vision is yet somewhat imperfect, to cast their suffrages in favor of these candidates, according to their party predilections while others refrained from going to the polls, deeming it a matter of small consequence which ever way the scale might turn. In profession, therefore, the entire District assumed to be abolition a fact which 'our southern brethren' are particularly requested to chronicle in their note-book.In respect to political action, the following is the course marked out by abolitionists to be pursued, with an undeviating step:First, to interrogate all candidates for a seat in Congress, respecting their views on the subject of slavery and the slave trade, the admission of new slave states, the right of petition, &c.Second, to vote for no man who refuses to reply, or whose answer is evasive or unsatisfactory.Third, to make the doctrine of immediate emancipation the test-question.Fourth, to regard the cause of the bondman as paramount to all party considerations and, therefore,Fifth, to vote for the candidate who appears to be the most trust-worthy, whether he be called whig or democrat, or by whatever party name.Guided by these plain rules, no consistent abolitionist residing in the Fourth District, can vote for either of the candidates now in nomination.The reply of Mr. Parmenter is radically defective upon the main question. He is, of course, in favor of free discussion and the right of petition. He is not in favor of  the Union another slave state. In his opinion, 'the powers possessed by Congress should be exercised to prohibit the inter state slave-trade, and to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia whenever such measures can be adopted consistently with the safety of the nation.' A man who is in doubt, whether it would be safe to stop the trade in 'slaves and souls of men,' immediately who hypothecates danger upon the act of letting the oppressed go free has no claim to the title of a democrat, and is surely not qualified to represent a free and christian people.Mr. Brooks persists in refusing to reply to the interrogations propounded to him. In so doing, he does not wish to be considered as lacking in courtesy, but conscientiously scrupulous on the score of duty. However satisfactory his reasons may appear to himself, the fact that he is unwilling to avow his opinions on fundamental questions, justly and necessarily precludes him from receiving the suffrages of abolitionists. It is his misfortune, if not his fault, that he cannot speak out his thoughts on all topics of importance, especially respecting the sundering of human yokes and fetters, and the rightfulness of delivering him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor. It is not a pledge, but an expression of opinion, an avowal of present conviction, that is solicited of him though, if he really apprehends and cherishes the 'self-evident truths' of the Declaration of Independence, if he believes in the inalienable rights of man, he ought not to shrink, for one moment in pledging himself, by his allegiance to God and his abhorrence of tyranny, that he will do all that in him lies to procure, forthwith and forever, the emancipation of the men, women and children, who are by a bloody edict of Congress held in chains and slavery. He cannot excuse himself, for not returning an answer, on the ground that 'actions speak louder than words.' The very fact that he is questioned by so large and respectable a body of his fellow-citizens, is decisive proof that they do not regard his actions as perfectly satisfactory. Nor can he plead that he is unwilling to announce his present convictions of duty, lest he may find occasion hereafter to change them. He is not asked, what will be his belief next year, but what is it now? And the question which is put to him, is not one that any additional light can possibly require a different answer. It relates to the inalienable rights of mankind, which are made apparent in exact proportion to the amount of light radiated upon them. Nor may he allege that a letter from him, on the eve of an election in which he is interested, would serve to degrade him as one eager to secure votes by gilded professions. These are solemn times, which do not admit of trifling. This is no electioneering trick, nor is it a local matter. The inquiries which are made of him embody all that is valuable in republicanism, and vital in christianity. They are not put for the purpose of annoyance, nor to injure his election, but in justice to the bleeding slave, and the cause of liberty itself, now outlawed in a land boasting of its unequalled regard for freedom and equality. And well he knows, that his case is not a peculiar one. His antagonist has also been fairly and respectfully interrogated on the same points. All over the free States, the same form of inquiry has been put to political candidates of all parties. Mr. Brooks, therefore, is without excuse for his silence; nay, in that he is dumb when his voice should be heard in clear and distinct tones, he deserves to receive the suffrage of no freeman. For if as some of his friends assert he is in favor of instant manumission, why does he not respond with his lips to the feelings of his heart, in the intelligible and generous language of Ireland's distinguished champion: 'I am an abolitionist. I am for speedy, immediate abolition. I care not what caste, creed or color, slavery may assume: I am for its total, its instant abolition. Whether it be personal or political, mental or corporeal, intellectual or spiritual, I am for its immediate abolition. I enter into no compromise with slavery. I am for justice, in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living God.'These strictures are made, not merely with special reference to the case of Mr. Brooks, but as applying to many similar instances, in this and other States, in which candidates have refused to answer the queries submitted to them, on the ground that they cherished too high a regard for individual freedom and independence to make any pledge, or express any opinion, in relation to the manner in which, if elected, they will discharge the highest and most solemn obligations that can rest upon accountable beings!In order to breed mutual distrust and jealousy in the minds of the abolition voters in the Fourth District, it has been falsely asserted by the whig organs, that nearly all the scattering votes have been cast by the whigs; that democratic abolitionists have closely adhered to their party views; and that all this excitement is an artful manoeuvre, on the part of 'democracy,' to re-elect William Parmenter by the aid of whig votes. Not to be outdone in untruthfulness, the democratic papers have brought the same charge of treachery against the whig abolitionists. The infamous conclusion of all these organs is, that the slave should be left to perish in his chains; that, because the members of one political party are basely recreant to their principles and professions, it is the bounden duty of members belonging to the opposite party to imitate their scandalous example! The logic is on a par with its morality. What if it were true, that on one part there is arrant duplicity on the other, perfect integrity? The fact, then, is as honorable to the one, as it is disgraceful to the other; and, instead of being an argument for universal profligacy, it imposes still higher obligations upon the 'faithful among the faithless found' to be unyielding in their adherence to principle. Abolitionists are about equally divided among both political parties. They meet in convention just before an important election, and seemingly in good faith, and with unusual solemnity, pledge themselves before God and the world, that, despite all party trammels and predilections, they will go to the polls, remembering those in bonds as bound with them, and bestow their suffrages upon whig or democrat who will go farthest in his opposition to slavery. It subsequently appears that there was no sincerity on the part of some, in making this pledge. With unblushing effrontery, the faithful and true are counselled, by those who would lead them by the nose obsequiously, to behave in the same treacherous manner, and thus show to the world that they neither fear God, nor regard the dying captive, whose cause they have pretended to commiserate. Monstrous inhumanity! The acme of devilish advisement! As if hypocrisy in others be an all-sufficient reason why it should be exemplified in us! As well might it be argued, that because one man has proved to be a thief, and a violator of social and governmental stipulations, all other members of the body politic are released from their moral obligations, and ought to turn thieves en masse!But it is not true, that any hollow-heartedness, any fraud, has been evinced by the abolitionists of either party in the Fourth District, at either of the recent trials to elect a representative to Congress. On the contrary, it is demonstrated by the official returns, duly authenticated by the Governor and Council, that they have acted in good faith, and performed their duty well and truly. Indeed, the exact relative proportion of scattering votes to the whole number given by each political party, is a most gratifying and extraordinary coincidence proving not only the general fidelity of abolition voters in that District to their cause, but also the equal prevalence of anti-slavery sentiments in both parties. On the last trial, the whole number of votes thrown was 8498; of which Nathan Brooks received 3862, and William Parmenter 3985. The number of scattering votes given was 658; of which 307 were cast by whig abolitionists, and 351 by democratic abolitionists as ascertained by the well-known political character of the individuals for whom these votes were thrown. This result is as cheering to the friends of emancipation throughout the country, as it is disheartening to its enemies. Can it be doubted that those who have met with unbroken phalanx the united forces of the two great parties, and turned the tide of victory in favor of humanity, will remain steadfast to the end of the conflict, through a hundred onsets?  corps du reserve   avowedly their                  whenever   pledging     en masse!        It cannot be denied, that, while the anti-slavery electors of Middlesex have thus honorably sustained their profession, others who have taken upon their lips the same promises, in some other parts of the country  in the day of trial, and thus betrayed the cause they professed to regard as sacred. A most humiliating spectacle has been presented in central New-York, in the open desertion from our standard of a large body of abolition voters, belonging almost exclusively to the whig party. Men who could stand up unflinchingly in the midst of the Utica mob of 1835 who, from an early period, had been storm-proof against every assault who even had found strength to snap asunder their sectarian ties, rather than abandon the slave have been found unable to carry out their principles at the ballot-box, though they had in public assemblies, and over their own sign-manual, giving a pledge to abandon all party considerations in their reverence for principle! This lamentable defection has well-nigh made shipwreck of our cause in that quarter. The contemplation of it is heart-sickening. It may, however, be overruled for good. In the end, nothing in lost by a separation of the true from the false; though, for a time, treachery may succeed in producing disastrous effects. If it must be so that only three hundred can be found disposed to lap water with their tongues, let them not fear; the Lord shall deliver the Midianites into their hands for the battle is his, and he saveth not by sword and spear. But, notwithstanding the plottings of some, and the apostacy of others, there are thousands who have never bowed the knee to Baal. Even in central New-York, a goodly number went through that fiery ordeal, 'unseduced, unterrified,' and came out without having so much as the smell of fire upon their garments. Among those who were most conspicuous for their zeal and devotion, their clear-sightedness and loyalty, at that alarming crisis, was our fire-proof coadjutor WILLIAM GOODELL, editor of the 'Friend of Man,' and that eminent philanthropist, GERRIT SMITH, of Peterboro'. All that men could do to reclaim the deserters, and prevent the utter ruin of our cause in that quarter, they manfully performed. They spoke trumpet-tongued, and their notes of tender remonstrance and solemn warning were not heard in vain. Already some have repented, and brought forth fruits meet for repentance. Others, convicted of sin in their own minds, and too proud or corrupt to make any confession, have branded these excellent men with every odious epithet, and joined with our most bitter assailants in impeaching their pure motives, and traducing their spotless characters. In every great reform, there will occur apostacies and seditions, and those who remain the truest to its great purpose must expect to be black-balled and reviled by the false-hearted, in the worst manner.           Afflicted by these sad developements, and somewhat disheartened in consequence, and to prevent, if possible, their recurrence, Mr. Smith proposes a new anti-slavery organization, which he thinks will remedy the evil.'Let the abolitionists, who are determined to maintain their principles in all circumstances, and who are unwilling to have abolition fellowship with those professed abolitionists, who can lay down their principles at the bidding of a demagogue let such, I say, organize themselves into new anti-slavery associations, whose constitutional laws shall forbid the members voting for pro-slavery men, for law-makers for men, who refuse to avow their belief in the doctrine of immediate deliverance from the yoke of slavery. Let this be done, and the present anti-slavery societies will, of course, fall speedily to the ground: even more speedily than did the wine-tolerating temperance societies after the introduction of the 'new pledge.' And then it will be understood, to the praise of an abolitionist, and to the glory and profit of his cause, that a member of an anti-slavery society is one, who never, in any circumstances or under any temptation, votes for a slaveholder, or a slaveholde's apologist; and then slaveholders will as soon presume to offer to sell their slaves to Quakers, as profligate politicians will to offer their pro-slavery votes to members of anti-slavery societies.'In anticipating the objections that might be raised to a new organization, Mr. Smith goes on to remark'It may be further objected to my proposition, that the principles set forth in the Constitutions of our present anti-slavery societies clearly and fully cover the whole ground of the political action, which is proper on the part of abolitionists. I admit it. I admit that he, who subscribes to the doctrine, that slavery is a palpable and an enormous sin, leaves himself entirely without excuse for voting for the abominable system. But, it must be remembered, that we live in a land, where a decided majority of the public teachers of religion admit the plea of expediency for waiving the application of even the fundamental principles of that religion. Whilst, on the one hand, many of them are constrained to admit, that there is sin in forbidding marriage and the reading of the Bible, and in marketing man as beasts, on the other, they are found pleading with paternal solicitude, that the system, whence these blasphemies naturally and necessarily flow, may be spared a little longer. Living in such a land, where even the expounders of religion authorize the disjoining of practice and profession, we cannot safely infer a man's practice from his admitted principles. If we could, then you would have been contented with the joint declaration of the whig candidates for Congress in your district, 'that slavery is a moral evil.' But, living as you do, in a land of expediency India-rubber-christianity, this admission, that slavery is sin, gave you no sufficient reason, nor indeed any reason at all for concluding, that the candidates, who made the admission, would, if elected, treat slavery as a sin, and exert their influence for its immediate overthrow.Let it be distinctly understood, that the form of the Constitution, which I recommend, is one, that forbids the members of the society voting wrong, and not one that enjoins their voting right. For, whilst no honest man will knowingly vote against his moral principles there are thousands of good men, who have conscientious objections against voting at all.'The point conceded by this earnest advocate of righteousness, that 'there are thousands of good men, who have conscientious objections against voting at all,' is one among the many strong reasons which, in the opinion of the Board, may be urged against his plan. Such men, under the new organization, (and all the women, likewise, who are prohibited from voting,) would probably be excluded, and either remain unorganized, or constitute themselves into separate societies. Thus a wide, and, in one aspect at least, an invidious separation will be made between those who are perfectly agreed upon fundamental principles, and who are now joined heart to heart, and hand to hand. It is easy to perceive, that if any other test than that of PRINCIPLE be set up if modes of action, about which there will certainly be conflicting opinions, be made 'parts and parcel' of the common standard instead of being a united, we shall be a divided house: and a house divided against itself cannot stand. There would be room for invidious comparisons, for hurtful jealousies, for fatal rivalries. Our means would no longer flow into a common treasury, and our measures would cease to be harmonious.Before making further criticisms upon this important proposition, (a proposition conceived in singleness of heart, and with a noble object in view,) the Board would adduce its excellent originator as a witness to testify against its utility. After stating that the deliberations of Abolitionists long since resulted in the determination to refuse to vote for any other men than those who, if elected to the national and state legislatures, would do what they could towards effecting a repeal of the laws upholding the execrable slave-system, Mr. Smith proceeds'Having determined upon this course, we resolved, as was natural, over and over again, in our public, meetings in the meetings of our town and county and State Anti-Slavery Societies and called on God to witness the sincerity and fixedness of our resolutions, that innocently we could not and that therefore we would not give our votes for any candidate for a seat in either the National or State Legislatures, who was unwilling to declare himself in favor of the great principles and measures of the anti-slavery association. In addition to this, our anti-slavery publications brought these resolutions, and the perfectly conclusive reasons for them, to the fireside of every abolitionist.We now began to hope confidently, that we should very soon see our State Legislatures composed of the friends of impartial and universal liberty, and very soon have an abolitionized Congress, that would rid the District of Columbia of slavery abolish the inter-state traffic in immortal beings and shut the door of the Union against the further admission of slaveholding States. But, alas! a dark cloud has come over our bright prospects. The abolitionists of the state of New York, in spite of their vows and pledges, and in spite of the upright example of a large proportion of their New England brethren, have shown their willingness to sacrifice the holy cause of crushed humanity on the polluted altar of party politics.'Here it will be seen, by Mr. Smith's own admissions, that, notwithstanding their assent to the principles of  slavery organization- their resolutions in town, county and state meetings, not to prostitute their suffrages to party purposes their solemn appeals to God to witness the sincerity of their hearts they have (in the State of New York) 'shown their willingness to sacrifice the holy cause of crushed humanity on the polluted altar of party politics'! What, then, is to be gained by a new organization? What stronger pledge can be made, what higher sanctions enforced, than those just recapitulate? If men calling themselves abolitionists can so easily break through all these restraints, and falsify all these promises, at the bidding of demagogues, and at the same time, by an ingenious process of political casuistry, satisfy themselves that they have not departed from the faith, of what avail to such men will be a political clause in the constitution, binding them not to vote for pro-slavery candidates? It is not a political, but a moral lesson that is taught us by a defection so lamentable. If the abolitionists in central New York had been sound in principle, they would have been upright in practice; they would have faithfully redeemed their pledge. Hence they need to be converted, and become as a little child to be baptized into the spirit of humanity before any new promise from them may be relied upon. It is inward light that men need for their safe guidance in action. If the law be not written upon their own hearts, all outward stipulations (whether graven upon tables of stone, or written upon parchment, or printed upon paper) will avail nothing.Mr. Smith is sanguine that the adoption of his plan cannot fail to produce the most salutary effects. His language is 'The members of the new societies would have happy fellowship, and act in useful concert with each other. Want of confidence, disgust and disunion, have now taken the place of that fellowship and concert, which once characterized the great body of the abolitionists of the State.' How all this evil is to be averted, and this happy fellowship ensured, by a mere political promise, it is difficult to perceive. A short trial only, the very next election, would expose the fallacy of the scheme. There is, there has been no reluctance, on the part of the professed friends of our cause, to promise to be faithful at the polls; but the grand difficulty is, to make all see eye to eye as to the abolition character of the several candidates. Those members of anti-slavery societies in New York, who voted in favor of the election of William H. Seward, doubtless persuaded themselves that they acred up to the spirit of their pledge. Nay, it is certain that they resent the impeachment of their abolition integrity as a libel. Other men, whose spirits were unshackled by party trammels, and whose vision was unclouded by party mists, beheld at a glance their glaring inconsistency of conduct. What is the remedy for this evil? Ten thousand new promises, on the part of such blind and pliant electors, would be nothing better than empty breath in the trial-hour of their integrity. At every new election, they would try to satisfy their consciences, that their favorite candidates were the enemies of slavery, who would certainly vote right in all cases. Even in the Fourth District, there are whig abolitionists who persist in advocating the pretensions of Nathan Brooks, and democratic abolitionist's who support William Parmenter. These men feel themselves deeply injured in being accused of abandoning the anti-slavery standard; but that they are false to their professions, that they love party more than they regard the slave, who that has a perfect vision does not see? It is the moral sentiment the innate, abiding conviction of the awful criminality of slavery that alone can regulate the elective franchise of the individual. But a mere agreement to do a certain act, sheds no new light upon the mind, quickens no moral instinct, informs not the understanding. We must build upon PRINCIPLE, or our labor will be in vain. It is the HEART we must conquer, and then we may trust the INTELLECT. If we rely upon a form of words, upon any organization, to keep us from pursuing a devious course, we shall at any time be in danger of falling away. If, in a cause, a struggle like this, our souls are not 'fastened to the throne of God as with hooks of steel,' we may not expect to be able to abide the day of visitation.There is another serious objection to the plan of Mr. Smith. If specifications are essential in our Constitutions, respecting the manner in which abolitionists shall act as members of the STATE, they are not less essential in relation to the manner in which they shall act as members of the CHURCH. We shall need, therefore, a clause to this effect that members, who are connected with any church, do pledge themselves that they will not hear any pro-slavery minister preach; nor sit at the communion-table with those who proscribe their colored brother; nor occupy a seat in any meeting-house in which a man is forced into an obscure corner on account of his complexion; nor be connected with a church which fellowships slaveholders &c. &c. How apparent it is, that if we once begin in this manner to make specifications, we shall not know when to end! A huge volume would not suffice to contain them. This is to make a measure, instead of a principle, the basis of our organization. And is it not as essential that the CHURCH should be purified, as that the STATE should be reformed? Is it not of as much importance to secure right religious, as it is right political action? Is there not as frequent violations of integrity on the part of religious, as there is on the part of political anti-slavery professors? Is it not true, that, comparatively, there are very few who are willing to stand by the sighing bondman under all circumstances, and in every extremity? The simplicity, safety, efficiency of our organization, depends upon its continuing to be based upon certain fundamental principles, leaving the application of those principles to be settled by the judgment and conscience of its members.There is yet another important consideration to be urged against the proposed organization. It would probably embody but a small portion of the moral power now existing in the present association; for none but legal voters, and those who believe it is their duty to engage in political action, would be likely to become its members, by abandoning the present organization. If any attempt be made, directly or indirectly, (as is strenuously advised by certain abolitionists,) to declare that it is the duty of all abolitionists to go to the ballot-box, then it follows that those who think otherwise, must be treated as recreant to duty. The Board deny that it is competent for any anti-slavery society, by its votes or through its organ, to arraign either the political or religious views of its members. It may with no more propriety decide, that one man is morally bound to cast a vote at the polls, than that another man is morally bound to unite himself to the church. On this subject, there are many conflicting, but honest opinions entertained by abolitionists. All that a society or its organ may rightfully do, is to entreat its members to abide by their principles, whether in the church or out of it, at the polls or elsewhere; to vote for no man, who is not in favor of immediate emancipation; to listen to no preacher, who apologizes for slavery.In a careful review, therefore, of the whole subject, the Board are satisfied that nothing will be gained by the new organization; that much may be lost by it; that it cannot embody as much moral power as the old one; that it presents no new motives for action, advances no new principles; that it would seem to wear a political rather than a moral aspect; and that the sanguine hopes of its noble projector would never be realized. They believe that the present anti-slavery societies are adapted to accomplish all that can be done by human organizations for the peaceful abolition of slavery; that they are slowly, but surely, effecting great and salutary changes, both in Church and State; that they are based upon the eternal principles of right and justice; and, therefore, that it would not be good policy to abandon them for a doubtful and an untried experiment.The Board desire not to be misunderstood in this matter. They have no faith in the efficacy of a political pledge, if adopted as the fundamental principle of anti-slavery organizations at their inception. The Board would not discourage its use as a temporary measure in particular districts, or on special exigencies. In these latter circumstances, the application of the rule recognized in the particular pledge, would be wholly free from difficulty. If adopted as one of the fundamental articles of the anti-slavery enterprise, the uncertainty of its application would soon render it futile; and it would probably divide the strength and attenate the funds of those who now pour their contributions into a common treasury, and who are now unitedly endeavoring to overturn the whole system of American slavery.             perfectly agreed upon fundamental principles, modes of action,        abolitionized     promise      is whether in the church or out of it, at the polls or elsewhere;     application      In the progress of our holy cause, incidental occurrences are from time to time transpiring, which, though strictly in furtherance of its one great object, are calculated to create a lively sensation in our ranks. It is well that abolitionists should know what spirit they are of, and what is the nature of the ground upon which they stand. The more freedom they enjoy in their own souls, the better qualified they will be to 'proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.' Among the incidents alluded to has been a discussion upon what has been technically called 'the woman question.' It is remarkable that this subject was first agitated by the 'Pastoral Association' of Massachusetts, in their spiritual Bull against the anti-slavery labors of those distinguished women, Sarah M. and Angelina E. Grimke. It was thrust, therefore, upon the consideration of the great body of abolitionists. At the last annual meeting of the New-England Anti-Slavery Convention, which was held in Boston, and attended by delegates from eleven States, it was'Voted, That all persons present, or who may be present at subsequent meetings, whether men or women, who agree with us in sentiment on the subject of slavery, be invited to become members, and participate in the proceedings of the Convention.'This was adopted without opposition; but, subsequently, it gave rise to a long and animated discussion, on a motion to rescind it. The Convention, however, adhered to the vote by a very large majority; and the consequence was, that eight clergymen (all of one denomination) desired their names to be expunged from the roll of that body. Seven individuals signed their names to the following Protest:'The undersigned, being of opinion that the action of the New-England Anti-Slavery Convention now in session, inviting women to vote, debate, and aid generally as members of this body, and refusing to reconsider the vote by which it was done, is injurious to the cause of the slave, by connecting with it a subject foreign to it; injurious as a precedent for connecting with it other irrelevant topics; and an innovation upon our previous usage in regard to the constituent elements of the Convention; ask leave to disclaim all responsibility in regard to said proceedings, by having this PROTEST endorsed upon the records, and published with the doings of the Convention.CHARLES T. TORREY, Salem.A.A. PHELPS, Boston.THOMAS EDWARDS, Mendon.SAMUEL D. DARLING, Milford, N.H.WILLIAM THURSTON, Bangor, Me.GEORGE TRASK, Warren, Mass.C. SPARRY, New-York city.'This subject is certainly some what novel; but, however inexpedient or improper it may be deemed by some, the Board do not see how it can be regarded as foreign or injurious to the cause of the slave. It is the grand object of the anti-slavery association to procure the liberation of two millions and a half of human beings, of both sexes and all ages, from their prison-house of bondage. It aims to accomplish this humane work 'through the foolishness of preaching,' by the freedom of speech. The question then is, is it foreign to our object to allow in our meetings a free utterance of the soul, whether it be enshrined in a male or female form; on the subject of slavery? Can it be 'injurious to the cause of the slave,' in a meeting of those who subscribe to the same principles, and who aim to accomplish the same thing, to suffer all the friends of that helpless captive, without reference to sex, to plead his cause to the best of their ability? Do we not allow, nay, invite his enemies to show cause why, he ought not to be emancipated? And shall we gag any of his friends, who may desire to lift up their voices in his behalf, merely because we have serious doubts conscientious scruples it may be, as to the propriety of such a procedure? Shall we constitute ourselves the judges of this or that person's right to speak a word for God and humanity, in our meetings? Or shall we not leave every one to bear his or her own responsibility in the case, with all charity and long-suffering? True, it is pleaded by some, that their rights of [ ] are invaded by conceding so much liberty to the [ ] sex: but these forget, or do not choose to [ ] that they in turn trample upon the [ ] those who desire to speak, and of those who [ ] right for them to speak, out of the fulness of [ ] thetic hearts.

           As when a gallant bark, suddenly overtaken on her voyage by a furious hurricane, groans through all her timbers now rising to a perilous height upon the storm-tossed billows, and anon plunging into the abyss of waters, yawning to devour escape from destruction seeming to be almost hopeless; so has the good ship ABOLITION just encountered the most violent gale yet recorded in her log-book, to the imminent peril of her existence, and not without injury to her spars and rigging, and the loss of some of her crew. It was a 'white squall' that struck her; and every experienced mariner knows that an ordinary tempest is nothing in comparison. There is little danger to be apprehended from the latter; for timely warning is given of its approach. The sunny face of the sky gradually assumes a troubled aspect, and afar off on the verge of the horizon portentous clouds are seen rising and thickening for the conflict, and the wind begins to whistle in fitful gusts, and the terror-stricken deep makes convulsive efforts to preserve its tranquillity. Forewarned by these signs, the observant officers and crew bestir themselves accordingly every sail is snugly secured, the hatches put down, and thus they safely 'bide the peltings of the pitiless storm.' But a 'white squall' is another affair entirely. It is full of treachery and peril. The most practised eye can hardly discern a single premonition. One moment, the stately bark is seen under full sail, dashing merrily onward before a propitious wind to her destined port the next, she is seen dismasted, or thrown on to her beam-ends, or with sails all torn and fluttering in the gale.Though the annual meeting of the State Society has terminated in a manner most gratifying to our feelings, and to the utter confusion of the faction who have sought to divide the anti-slavery ranks, yet the remembrance of its turbulent scenes fills our breast with pain and sorrow. For the first time in our life, of the thousand abolition gatherings that we have attended in various parts of our country, have we seen professed abolitionists exhibiting a spirit of insubordination disgraceful to themselves, and injurious to their holy cause. For the first time, likewise, have the enemies of human rights found just occasion to point the finger of reproach at Massachusetts abolitionists, and to exult in view of their dissentions. A fearful amount of responsibility rests upon the men, of whose disorganizing measures we have already apprised our readers.At the opening of the meeting on Wednesday forenoon, the number of delegates in attendance, from all parts of the Commonwealth, was unusually large showing that an intense interest was felt in the proceedings about to be acted upon, and that, whatever might be the voice of the Society, the result would be decisive as to the wishes of the great body of abolitionists in this State. The forenoon was occupied with preliminary matters, and the reading of the Annual Report. No unpleasant outbreak occurred until the afternoon; when a question having arisen as to who were entitled to vote, Mr. St. Clair stated, that in moving that 'all persons present' be invited to take a part in the proceedings of the meeting, he did not mean to include the women. Some clapping followed this explanation, on the part of some who are for keeping woman in her 'appropriate sphere,' which was instantly succeeded by a general hissing many regarding it as a piece of deception, and so manifesting their displeasure in this reprehensible manner. During the remainder of the afternoon and evening, and a portion of the ensuing day, much excitement prevailed in the meetings, and it required all the firmness and decision of the President (for which he is remarkable) to preserve order. Indeed, the conduct of some of the Torrey faction was disorderly in the extreme. The more apparent it became that they constituted but an insignificant portion of the large assembly, the more boisterous and dogmatical was their behaviour. After all their sly management and deceptive proceedings prior to the meeting, to find themselves in a lean minority was more than they could easily bear. They were allowed to occupy at least two-thirds of the time, in the vain attempt to satisfy the audience that they were the only consistent abolitionists in the Commonwealth; that there had been no plotting, as had been laid to their charge; that the Liberator was a highly injurious publication, having abandoned the old standard; that its editor was recreant to the cause of the slave and by admitting articles into his paper on the subject of Peace, PRO and CON, nullified all that could be said or done respecting the duty of political action; and yet, (strange paradox! believe their professions who will,) that they had a high regard for the editor of the Liberator, did not wish to abridge the circulation of his paper, and hoped it would continue to receive the support of abolitionists!!! If any evidence had been wanting to sustain all the charges we had brought against them, their conduct and incoherency of speech, on this occasion, more than confirmed the worst suspicions in regard to the purity of their motives and the object they had in view. It was apparent to all impartial observers, that they were not actuated by any special regard for the cause of the perishing slave, but by the strongest aversion to the Liberator and its editor. 'DIVIDE AND CONQUER,' is manifestly their motto. Though they monopolised a large portion of the time in speaking, yet whenever any attempt was made to bring the discussion to a close, they clamored loudly about 'gag-laws,' &c.; it seeming to be their aim to talk against time, so as to weary out the patience of the audience, in the expectation that by every hour's delay, the immense majority against them would be reduced by the withdrawal of delegates. Of the course of argument that was pursued, we shall have something to say in another number. The dogma attempted to be maintained was, that it is the moral and religious duty of every abolition voter to go to the polls, whatever may be his views of government; and that whoever refuses to vote, however conscientious he may be on this subject, is to be treated as an enemy of the cause, and drummed out of the camp!! On this ground, we have ever been disloyal to the anti-slavery cause, as we have not cast a single vote at the polls since we became its advocate! Neither has our bro. Samuel J. May and many of the most tried friends of abolition are in a similar predicament! This dogma is a most impudent assumption on the part of those who support it warranted by nothing in the constitution or government of the anti-slavery association and diametrically opposed to that liberty of conscience which is to be prized above all price. It is now resorted to merely for effect. The Liberator and its editor must be put down; and no matter by what means it be done, so it be accomplished. The hypocrisy of these political disorganizers will soon be made apparent to all who have eyes to see.It will be seen, that the proposition to establish another anti-slavery newspaper in Massachusetts was indefinitely postponed by an overwhelming majority; and that, notwithstanding every effort was made to change its character, the Annual Report was adopted by a vote of 8 to 1; thus proving conclusively, that those who seconded the treacherous designs of that grand mischief-maker, and cordial participant in the Clerical Appeal conspiracy, Charles T. Torrey of Salem, were a very small minority. The vote upon the Report was declared as follows: Yeas 198, Nays 24! All those portions of the Report, which were contested, we have inserted without abridgment in the preceding page to the exclusion of much other important matter. But more anon.Notwithstanding the decisive verdict of the Society against their project, the disorganizers are about starting a new weekly journal, to be called. 'The Massachusetts Abolitionist.' There is great rejoicing among the pro-slavery divines, in all quarters. They care not what is substituted in its stead, only SINK THE LIBERATOR. From facts already within our possession, we cannot doubt that those professed friends, who have suddenly lifted their heels against us, are disposed to resort to every low artiflce and the most scandalous misrepresentations, to carry their point. 'Thus saith the Lord, Cursed is he that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.'The anti-slavery house in this Commonwealth is now divided against itself and how can it stand? What its most powerful enemies could not do, is now to be effected by the treachery of its former friends!      persons            

                 All governments are founded upon one of two distinct, and to some extent, conflicting assumptions. The advocates of popular governments take the ground, that man has an inherent right, as an independent sovereign, to take the government and protection of himself into his own hands; or, in other words, to enact laws for his own government, and to retaliate upon those who do him injury. This is the only consistent ground which such persons can take; for if men, as individuals, do not possess these rights, it is self-evident, that no confederation or combination of any give number of such individuals can ever create them. If a single cent does not possess the least particle of gold, the bringing together of millions of such cents will not, and cannot create a single particle. If therefore the right of self-government, and of rendering evil for evil does not belong to individuals as such, and cannot be maintained, the whole fabric of popular governments is without any just foundation, and must ultimately crumble into dust.Despotic governments, on the other hand, are based upon the contrary assumption, viz. that the civil or ecclesiastical legislator and ruler, by virtue of a divine right, conferred upon them as the vicegerents of God, possess the requisite authority to enact laws for the government of the people, and to enforce these laws by the infliction of appropriate penalties. If therefore despotic governments, or those professedly founded upon the jure divino principle, or principle of divine right, cannot show us their commission, accompanied with the seal and signature of Almighty God; or, if they cannot give us indubitable evidence from the bible, or from some other source of equal authority, of their divine commission and vicegerency, we must look upon them as flagrant usurpers and impostors. Our object in noticing the rival claims of human governments, civil and ecclesiastical, is to show, that the whole of them are based upon impious assumptions are without any just foundation whatever, and, as such, should be discountenanced and opposed by every friend of God and man. We will commence with an examination of the first principle, which forms the basis of popular governments.I. We deny that man has any right, either inherent or derived, to take the government or protection of himself, by legal statute or penalty, or by physical force, into his own hands that he has any right to enact laws, either for his own government or for the government of others. We give the following reasons for this denial.1. God is the only independent sovereign in the universe, and the only rightful legislator among men or angels while all created beings are but dependent subjects of his righteous government. His laws recognize every possible case of criminality, hence the enactment of other or additional laws by men, are, to say the least, unnecessary, if they are not an implied impeachment of the divine wisdom and goodness.2. When men take the government of themselves into their own hands, they thereby declare themselves independent of their lawful and only sovereign, the Lord Almighty. It is the very thing which makes men rebels against the laws and government of God it is putting self upon the throne in man, instead of the king of all the earth it is the creature endeavoring to wrench the reins of the governmental chariot out of the hands of the Creator, and is the very essence of that 'carnal mind which is enmity against God.'3. It is an incontrovertible truth, that man never did, and never will, and never can govern himself. He was made to be governed, not by himself, but by the mightiest, wisest, and best of Beings; and so far as man has been kept within the bounds even of propriety and good order, it has been through the overruling, but to a great extent, unseen providence of that God from whom cometh every good and perfect gift. It is said, both by politicians and priests, that the government of this country may properly be denominated an experiment, designed to prove the sufficiency of man to govern himself; and the failure of this experiment is equally deprecated by both, inasmuch as it will extinguish the last hope of the world, in regard to this momentous question. To both these classes of men we can say with the most undoubting confidence, YOUR EXPERIMENT WILL FAIL as has every similar one to invent a self-moving machine, or to detect a universal specific among medicines.II. We deny that man has the right to take the protection of himself into his own hands by retaliating upon others who do him injury, or in other words, to render evil for evil in any case whatever. The Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles have most clearly and decisively settled this question. 'Ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, that ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. Mat. v. 38 40. Let it be distinctly observed, that the reference here made by Christ to the principle of retaliation is made in the very words of the Jewish civil code, which was instituted by Jehovah himself! see Lev. xxiv. 17, 21. 'He that killeth any man shall surely be put to death. And he that killeth a beast shall surely make it good; beast for beast. And if any man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done so shall it be done to him: breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again. And he that killeth a beast he shall restore it; and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.' Remember, that in no case under the Jewish dispensation or civil government was man, as an individual, allowed to render evil for evil, except in the single case of the manslayer. Retaliation was only allowed in the authorized magistrate as the representative of God. Now observe, when Jesus referred his hearers to the law of retaliation, which law constituted the great fundamental principle in the Jewish civil government, and when in express terms he repealed that law, he laid the axe at the root of that government, and virtually repealed or abrogated the whole of it; for of what force can any civil government be, which cannot enforce its laws by inflicting evil upon its violators? When Jesus took from the Jewish civil ruler the right to inflict punishment, he declared the only civil government, which God had ever instituted, and recognized as of any rightful authority, to be null and void forever.Again: 'Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you 'and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you.' Mat. v. 43, 44. 'Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord, Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.' It will be admitted by all, who receive the plain declarations of scripture as truth, that no man, as an individual, has the right to render evil for evil, or to enforce even his lawful claims by his fist, the club, or the sword. But if man has no such right, as an individual, he has none as a member of a family; as the inhabitant of a town, county, state, or nation; hence, cannot delegate any such rights to others, called legislators, magistrates, judges, sheriffs, &c. If no man has the right to retaliate with the fist or club, or sword, it is equally and immutably true, that he has no right to render evil for evil by using laws, or magistrates, or judges, or sheriffs, as the clubs, or swords, or the instruments of such retaliation.When men 'resist evil,' either by the use of the club, or of human law, the principle upon which they act is the same in both cases the only difference is in the instruments employed. The mob resorts to stones, brickbats, clubs, fire, and sword the advocates for human governments resort to law, and the instruments of its execution in order to avenge themselves upon their real or supposed enemies in order to compel men by force and arms to do, or to desist from doing what is really, or supposed to be, injurious to them. In vain do the people called Quakers protest against war, while they are engaged in lawsuit wars among themselves about meeting houses, wood and stones, brick and mortar and equally in vain do 'peace societies,' so called, write, and lecture against war among nations, so long as they countenance the principle of retaliation, which forms the basis of all human governments. If they would effect any thing, let them lay the axe at the root of the tree. Such persons may talk, and preach, and write about peace; but to all such God may instly say, 'What hast thou to do with peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother are so many?'  as individuals,  create bringing together create  individuals as such,   divine right, jure divino         experiment,    Jewish civil code, eye for eye, tooth for tooth;   as an individual, as a member of a family; as the inhabitant of a town, county, state, nation; delegate   peace; peace   

       Agreeably to public notice, given on the adjournment of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, on Friday afternoon, a meeting of FRIENDS OF THE LIBERATOR was held at Marlborough Chapel on the evening of that day. The meeting first assembled in Hall No. 2, but notwithstanding a large portion of the delegates had returned to their homes, the place was not large enough to contain those who desired to furnish, at this crisis in the anti-slavery cause, a fresh testimony of their attachment to the paper that was instrumental, under God, in arousing from their long night of slumber, those who are now enlisted in the warfare against American slavery; and, consequently, and adjournment to the large and spacious Chapel became necessary. The meeting was called to order by EDMUND QUINCY; after which, FRANCIS JACKSON, President of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, was called to the chair, and J.A. COLLINS, member of the Andover Theological Seminary, appointed Secretary.On motion of Mr. PETTIBONE of Andover, it wasVoted, to appoint a committee of seven to draft resolutions, expressive of the views and feelings of the meeting. Whereupon, the following persons were appointed:John Bailey, of New Bedford; J.N. Buffum, of Lynn; Edmund Quincy, Wendell Phillips, Samuel E. Sewall, Maria W. Chapman, and Thankful Southwick, of Boston.Henry C. Wright addressed the Throne of Grace.While the committee were engaged in preparing resolutions, interesting remarks were made by J.V. Himes, Philemon R. Russell, Henry C. Wright, Richard Thayer, and George Bradburn of Nantucket.The committee appointed to draft resolutions submitted the following for the consideration of the meeting.                   Whereas, the Liberator was the first paper devoted to the cause of immediate emancipation in the United States; and the first to brand the colonization scheme as hypocrisy, and prove it before the world the foe of the colored race; andWhereas, it has ever been the consistent advocate of the rights of the slave, diverted from its onward course neither by the violence of mobs, the clamor of party selfishness, or the opposition of spiritual wickedness in high places; andWhereas, it has ever been fearless in its rebuke of faltering friends as well as of open foes; andWhereas, with an instinctive sagacity which has anticipated every danger and defeated every plot, whether of open enemies or hollow friends, it has been the first to summon with trumpet-tones the friends of humanity to the rescue;Therefore, influenced by no personal sympathies, but by deep convictions of duty to the cause1. Resolved, That we regard the prosperity of the Liberator as identified with that of the anti-slavery enterprise.2. Resolved, That with GERRIT SMITH, we believe 'that the Liberator should ever be dearer to the heart of every genuine abolitionist than any other paper;' and that, 'among the many things in which THE ABOLITIONISTS of OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE AGREED, are the following:(1) THE LIBERATOR MUST BE SUSTAINED.(2) Its editor must be kept above want; not only, nor mainly, for his own and his family's happiness; but that, having his mind unembarrassed by the cares of griping poverty, he may be a more effective advocate of the Savior's enslaved poor.'3. Resolved, That, so far from looking upon the expression of the peculiar views of its editor on other topics as a fault, or esteeming it a hindrance to the progress of the abolition cause, we value the Liberator for its fearless toleration and free discussion of all truth; and though we do not hold ourselves responsible for any sentiments uttered in its columns, we abhor that sectarian bigotry which would prescribe their free utterance, and clog its editor with the shackles of any party or sect.4. Resolved, That while there exists among abolitionists such irreconcilable difference of opinion, both as to fundamental principles and on questions of party politics, so far from deeming the course of the Liberator faulty in respect to political action, we look upon the ground it has occupied as the only one upon which any anti-slavery periodical can stand the urging upon every individual, action consistent with his principles and his conscience.5. Resolved, That the women of Lynn, by their recent appropriation of $500.00 to the Liberator, have, in this most trying crisis of our cause, shown a sagacity, foresight and liberality worthy of imitation and praise.6. Resolved, That we regard it as a solemn duty to the oppressed, to use our utmost efforts to extend its circulation as widely as possible.7. Resolved, That we earnestly exhort the abolitionists throughout the land, and especially those of Massachusetts, to take IMMEDIATE measures to multiply its subscribers, and thus enlarge the sphere of its usefulness.Remarks in support of these resolutions were made by Amasa Walker, Wendell Phillips, and Edwin Thompson, after which they were unanimously adopted, nearly the whole assembly rising in their favor.Papers were then circulated, 42 new subscribers obtained, and donations and pledges made in support of the paper to the amount of more than $160.00.D.K. Hitchcock, of Boston, offered the following resolution, which was adopted nem. con.Resolved, That any and all attempts to deprive W.L. Garrison and Isaac Knapp of the fruits of their labors, are as shameful as they are nefarious; and we pledge ourselves to remain true to them so long as they remain true to the slave.The meeting will be long remembered for the delightful harmony that prevailed, and for the spirit of zeal and devotedness that characterized its proceedings.After voting to publish the proceedings in the Liberator, and to request all other papers friendly to the anti-slavery cause to copy them, the meeting adjourned sine die.                      we look upon the ground it has occupied as the only one upon which any anti-slavery periodical can stand             nem. con.       and to request all other papers friendly to the anti-slavery cause to copy them, sine die.    FRANCIS JACKSON, Chairman.   J.A. COLLINS, Secretary.    

            It will be admitted by all who are familiar with the scriptures, that the bible recognizes two distinct kinds of government, a moral and providential, which the king of the universe has exercised over his creatures. By a moral government, we understand one which employs moral influence or preceptive laws, which commend themselves to the understandings and consciences of the governed, and which are enforced by appropriate sanctions. By providential government, we understand that wise and benevolent control which the Supreme Being exerts over all the actions of his creatures, whether moral, or immoral, or neither; and over all events for the promotion of his own highest glory, and the best good of the universe.When therefore, the bible speaks of human governments, it must recognize them, either as forming so many parts of a system of divine moral government, or else as merely connected with that providential control, by which Jehovah makes the wrath of man to praise him, and restrains the remainder. If they form parts of a divine moral government, then are all nations under a genuine Theocracy hence every civil officer becomes an authorized and approved representative of God; every civil statute a divine command; and every judicial decision a righteous sentence because the same scriptures which recognize any human government, any civil ruler, legislator, judge, enactment, sentence, &c. as of any authority whatever, equally recognize all, and every one of them as possessing precisely the same authority, in all cases, without any exception, or qualification. For evidence of this, see the following passages: 'Let every soul be subject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.' Rom. xiii. 1, 2. Two things are to be observed in this passage: 1. No positive support, by active obedience, such as is rendered to moral precept, is required for the purpose of upholding these governments all that is required is simply non-resistance. 2. No exception or proviso is made it is neither expressed nor implied, that resistance can be innocently made in any case whatever on the contrary, the prohibition is absolute and unqualified; and insists upon an unvarying and uniform submission at all times, in all circumstances, in all cases of whatever nature. Again: 'Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well.' 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. Here again, unqualified and uniform submission is required; but not because the ordinances of human rulers are morally right, or possess any just authority, but because the Lord requires it 'for the Lord's sake.'  Now we presume that no man will take the ground, that every civil ruler is a genuine representative of God, such as Moses was, in connection with the administration of a divine moral government, nor that every civil enactment is a divine moral precept; and if any of them are not, then none of them are; as they are all placed upon precisely the same basis, and are equally of the same authority. The irresistible inference is, that all human governments are connected only with that providential government, which takes in all things both good and bad, and which wisely overrules all the evil for good that they possess no more legal or moral authority than any other instruments of divine providence, which are either purely evil, or are incapable of possessing or exhibiting moral qualities.But will it be said, 'that human governments are ordained of God?' So are famines, and pestilences, earthquakes, and innundations in the same sense so were the oppressions and cruelties of Pharaoh, of Sennacherib, of Nebuchadnezzar, &c. So also is the dominion of 'the basest of men,' see Dan. iv. 17. 'It is said, that the power of the civil magistrate is of God, of course a power which he lawfully possesses and uses.' So the power with which Pilate condemned Jesus to be crucified was of God; as Jesus said to him, 'Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.' Now if this power means moral right or authority, then Jesus was justly condemned. 'Civil rulers are said to be sent for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well.' True so were the kings of Assyria, of Babylon, of Edom, and Moab, and Ammon sent for the punishment of wicked Israel, and for the praise of the true Israelite; yet God denounced and punished all these kings and their people for these very doings toward Israel. 'They are said to be the ministers or servants of God.' So was Nebuchadnezzar called the servant of God, appointed to punish and conquer, and govern the nations for which very things he was afterwards punished. So, in the same sense, are 'fire and hail; snow and vapors; stormy winds fulfilling his word.''But we are required to pay them tribute and honor.' So, God paid Nebuchadnezzar wages for 'the service that he served against Tyre;' but not because he rendered a moral or intended service unto God, but for the purpose of supporting him in the work of punishing the nations, for which he had employed him, and for which he afterward punished him. Not only are we required to honor rulers, but 'all men.' 1 Pet. ii. 17. 'It is said that supplications, and intercessions, &c. should be made for kings, and for all that are in authority.' But for what? Not that they may be continued and supported, but 'that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty' that they may be restrained from depriving us of our liberty of conscience, or any other rights.Now let us examine the ground which Christ and his apostles took, in relation to the course which those should pursue, who profess to be governed by the principles of the gospel. In his Sermon on the mount, Jesus said, 'If any man sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.' Matt. v. 40. The doctrine which Jesus was here inculcating, was that of unqualified non-resistance. The obvious and undoubted meaning of this passage is, 'when a suit at law is brought against you, whether just or unjust, make no defence instead of entering into any such strife, rather let him have both coat and cloak.' We all know that defensive action, in all cases, is considered, if not innocent, at least, less criminal than offensive. But here defence is prohibited and most certainly, if a man cannot innocently defend himself in a court of law, he cannot, without the deepest criminality, commence a suit, or make an attack upon another. But if good men cannot innocently make any use of human law, can other, or wicked men justly meddle with its jargon and strife. Certainly not. Then, of course, all human law is wrong, and cannot be supported without opposition to the throne and government of God.Again: 'Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?' I Cor. vi. 1, 5, 7. If the civil magistrate is the vicegerent of God, appointed to assist him in administering a moral government over men, why any impropriety in employing him? There could be none whatever; and to speak as Paul does of him, in this passage, would, in that case, be speaking very disparagingly of God in the person of his representative. There are three grievous sins mentioned in this passage: 1. Going to law before the unjust, the unbelievers. 2. Brother going to law with brother. 3. Going to law in any case, even where the offending individual is not really a brother, but a fraudulent knavish character. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded, than go to law in any case whatever? The apostle in this expostulation evidently means to prohibit recourse to human law, even where we have a just claim, and an unworthy or bad person to deal with. And if it is wrong in saints to prosecute others before human magistrates, it is wrong in all.Now let us look at the course pursued by the various sects, in regard to human governments. But few congregations are to be found, which are not regularly incorporated according to law; thus they are authorized to see subscribers to their funds appropriated to the building of their meeting houses, the support of their priests, &c. Several of their pseudo benevolent societies have also been incorporated by the state legislatures; and all of them would be, if their directors and supporters could have their will and they have never hesitated to carry their claims before human courts, to compel the payment of them. Beside, there is scarcely one of them, that would not readily receive almost any support, which human rulers and legislators would give them; and which would not, if they had it in their power, enforce their religion, their creeds, their disciplines, and their preaching, with civil pains and penalties. In spirit, civil and sectarian governments are the same, and are based upon the same sandy foundation they mutually sustain each other in their usurpation of the prerogatives of the only Lord God, and thus sit in his temple, showing themselves, as it were, to be God. Notice how careful politicians are, not to meddle with any point, in support of which the corrupt sects are likely to unite; but always manage on religious questions so as to divide them, and set them by the ears among themselves, (which is very easily done with such combinations of selfishness and hate,) and then they are prepared to carry their point. Where the combined powers of the sects control human legislation, church and state are in effect, and in spirit united, and must stand or fall together.    that be  every ordinance 'for the Lord's sake.'   legal moral authority   moral right authority,      unqualified non-resistance. make no defence        

 NATHAN BROOKS AND H.B. STANTON. In the present crowded state of our columns, it would not be convenient for us, even if we felt that justice required it at our hands, to publish the elaborate and lengthy vindication of Mr. Brooks, respecting the Townsend affair, (now almost an old story,) sent to us by an unknown correspondent at Concord, who signs himself 'A Friend of Man, White as well as Black.' But we feel under no obligation to give it an insertion in the Liberator. We shall state our reasons briefly:1. The controversy is between Mr. Brooks and Mr. Stanton, over their own proper signatures. Mr. S. asks no assistance of any correspondent. It is to be presumed that Mr. B. is able to make out as good a case for himself as any one can for him. If he can refute the facts and reasoning advanced by Mr. S., he knows that we shall most willingly allow him ample space to do so in our columns. We prefer to let the principals settle this matter between themselves.2. Our correspondent thinks that Mr. Brooks had good and sufficient reasons for believing, 'that Mr. Stanton had labored publicly to propagate an idea in relation to him, which was false, absolutely and entirely false.' Be it so, for argument's sake. As both Mr. S. and ourselves have explicitly exonerated Mr. Brooks from all participation in the Townsend affair, what more can in justice be required of either?3. The 'fifty-seven' individuals, who have testified over their own signatures that Mr. Stanton did not argue at the Concord Convention as Mr. B. alleged, upon the (anonymous) authority of 'several abolitionists,' have thus vindicated Mr. S. from calumnious aspersions, and exculpated Mr. B. from all blame as to the closing of the Townsend meeting-house, so far as relates to any thing that was said or done in that Convention.4. Mr. Brooks is bound to produce the names of the 'several abolitionists,' who, he says, told him a story which is flatly contradicted by fifty-seven members of the Convention. In justice to himself, he should bring them forward; and they owe it to him to come at his call. It will then be seen whether they are his partizans or not.5. Our correspondent says that 'it is known that there were about 130 gentlemen present at the Convention delegates and others.' If this be so, Mr. Brooks may, peradventure, yet make it appear that a majority of the Convention are ready to contradict what is stated by the fifty-seven! Unless he produce their names, it will leave him in a worse dilemma than before. For ourselves, we doubt whether the whole number of those who participated in the doings of the Convention, exceeded at any one time three score and ten persons.     principals           

       Extracts from an unpublished Manuscript, written by a late member of the Bar:Among the many madmen I have met with, was a christian lawyer, who tried to reconcile his practice with his duty. The old grudges of his business often haunted his mind. Frequent collisions, sarcasms, undue advantages and provocations, irritated him, and deprived him of that tranquility of mind which is the privilege of the Christian. He therefore doubted his christianity. To clear his doubts and to tranquilize his feelings, he resolved whenever he recollected an old injury, or received a new one, to repeat these words in his mind: 'I do believe, and I will believe.' He thought the repetition of these words would operate like a charm to banish the demons of the law, and summon the spirits of religion. It was a vain effort. Something more was necessary to 'perfect that which was lacking in his faith.' He then consulted me. I suggested to him that he had better become a master of religion, just as he would advise another to become a master of law, by practice. He replied, that his mind was easily disordered, and that he could not practice religion, while he expressed or even felt resentment. 'I know,' he added, 'I might retire from the temptations of the law. I should not advise a young christian to encounter them. But I have acquired fame and fortune by my practice. My legal success has unhappily made the first men in the city my enemies. I recollect their envious attacks upon me. My christianity affords them new means of aggression, and deprives me of the right to retaliate. Here, then, I desire to conquer by suffering, and not only to act, but to feel like a christian, amidst constant irritations.' I perceived his danger and pitied his infirmity. After much reflection, I told him to repeat the Lord's Prayer, as soon as he felt a temptation to be angry or unkind, and to continue the repetition of it, until he could forgive and love the subjects of his animosity. He agreed to follow my advice, but found it necessary to use the prayer not only to overcome, but to prevent the temptations to ill-will. He soon commanded the esteem of the court and bar, by his modest and respectful behavior, and by all those innocent arts, by which orators soothe and flatter their hearers. The madness which had darkened his mind, was succeeded by a light which enabled him to pity and forgive the common madness. His subsequent life was a personification of the gospel. I will relate so much of it, as will explain the gospel; so that whoever shall adopt his principles, may apply them to the infinite concerns of life.His first action was for the owner of ten thousand acres of land, which had been trespassed upon by hundreds of farmers, who were able to cultivate, but not to purchase the land. His client succeeded in ejecting the tresspassers. When one of them abused the advocate for the verdict he had obtained, he began to pray, 'Thy kingdom come,' but was stopped by the reflection, that the kingdom of heaven can never come, while one man owns ten thousand acres, and ten thousand men own none. He confessed to the trespasser, that the law originated in conquest, and that all his influence should be employed to make the land, like the air, and sky, and water, promote the happiness of the many, and not the pride of a few.In his second case, he justified a seller of wines, because he had a license. Reproached by a temperance man, he prayed, 'Thy will be done,' and was convinced that the will of God could not be done, while one man is licensed by law to seduce the community to disobey his will If men cannot be happy in disobeying the divine law, how can they be happy in obeying a human law, which sets aside the divine?His third case concerned the settlement of a pauper. During the trial, he himself was tried by his conscience, as he repeated, 'on earth as it is in Heaven.' There will be no paupers in Heaven, and there should be none on earth. Hard, indeed, is the task of reformers! Can we convince mankind, that any system of government may free men, as nature frees beasts, from the burden of paupers and princes, of patients and physicians, of criminals and judges, of soldiers and heroes?His fourth case related to the ownership of a sword. He could not pray for his 'daily bread' during this trial, without reflecting that the sword deprives us of grain, and that grain itself is ratified by a seditious heat into the poison that excites war. A sweet vision rose upon his mind, as the thought occurred to him, that when the sword shall be turned into the plough share, that ploughshare by the ingenuity of mechanical invention, shall do the work of hundreds as now driven by oxen, and that a child or a woman may instantly use the physical power of an army. If men were satisfied with their daily bread, they would have no use for the sword; but as they never have been thus satisfied, we may perhaps infer that it is the intent of nature not to suppress, but to satisfy our desires. If it is the instinct of man to be satisfied with nothing short of royal accommodations and pleasures, then arts, and not arms, must be resorted to; for by arms only a few can be gratified at the expense of the rest, whereas all may obtain the luxuries of life as cheap as air by the operation of mechanical ingenuity. Men never yet seem to have possessed the necessary element of self-government. They have had their daily bread, but their daily wants have not been supplied. The mass of the people should be employed in using, not in earning wealth. They will have the elements of government, when the poorest possess all the means of enjoyment. God places some in such elevated conditions, that a prayer for daily bread imports much more than for mere sustenance. Others would be satisfied with bread. In general, however, all desire to be as happy as their neighbors, and happiness is the bread we pray for. We seek for a paradise, but the sword converts the world into a desert. If we enjoyed a paradise, we should no longer use the sword.The fifth action of our advocate was trespass against a person for entering a garden in disguise, to carry away the fruit. The disguise increased the penalty. As he prayed 'forgive our trespasses,' he thought how often the law trespassed against us, under the disguise of right or equity, or expediency. The rights of the best half of our species, the female sex, are trampled upon under the disguise of delicacy; the rights of the slave, under the disguise of purchase; of the imprisoned debtor, under the disguise of justice; of the soldier, under the disguise of honor. What but power, under the disguise of law, and law, under the disguise of right, creates so many inequalities, tyrannies, oppressions, temptations, and domestic, social, and public evils? If the law required, that all men should do as they would be done by, most of our statutes would be repealed by the removal of the causes which procured their enactment. The rights of men might be described in a few volumes, perhaps pages, but the disguises of those rights have made justice a lottery, in which the prize is drawn by the successful litigant by chance, out of the ten thousand contradictory volumes which prove nothing but the 'glorious uncertainty of the law.' How often are the fruits of the human garden carried away by priests, under the disguise of piety; by lawyers, under the disguise of justice; by physicians, under the disguise of health; by merchants, under the disguise of honesty; by soldiers, under the disguise of honor; by governors, under the disguise of protection? Is not peace often war, friendship enmity, liberality selfishness, in disguise? The world seems to be a masquerade, in which men assume the appearance of some virtue; and when the mask is torn off, they fight for the virtue under the flag of patriotism. If they would be as virtuous as they wish to appear, or even keep up appearances faithfully, they would always be courteous, and generally happy. As disguises will not protect us from the insurrections of passion, nor from the invasions of ambition, nor from the condemnation of God, we had better be sincerely virtuous, and endeavor to reform those laws of fashion, which seem to make hypocrisy a virtue, at least in the estimation of the hypocrites of creeds, who persuade the young to subscribe to dogmas, which are disguised for virtues. It is easier to be a pharisee than a christian, to make long prayers, than to feel the spirit of our Lord's prayer, which is so reasonable, that even those who make no pretensions to piety, might adopt it as the unerring guide to happiness. Most of the opinions which pass for sacred truths, are but disguised errors Were not our deeds evil, we might detect our errors, which commonly are trespasses against God.How can we understand human nature, so long as we industriously conceal it under disguises? It has been said that if we expel nature with a pitchfork, it will nevertheless return. Let us follow nature, or, which means the same thing, let us strive to produce the kingdom of God, agreeably to the principles of the gospel.The sixth action related to the forgery of a will. As our advocate prayed that he might forgive others, he felt conscious that governments, churches, and individuals, all need forgiveness for forging the will of God? Do not all idolators forge the will of God? Are not all auspices and omens forgeries of His will? Do not all governments originate in some forgery of his will? Do not nearly all our pernicious laws and customs originate in some pious fraud? Do not nearly all our sins, and vices, and crimes, come from counterfeiting some pleasure, or virtue, or right? Are we not constantly altering the records of conscience? Do we not constantly utter and publish as true, the false, forged, or altered records, deeds, instruments, and other writings of nature and of God, knowing the same to be false, forged or counterfeit, with intent to injure or defraud? Is it not as criminal to forge the will of God as the will of man? Can our gentlemen of honor aver upon their honor, that in all affairs of honor, one or other of the parties is not supposed to be guilty of the basest and meanest forgery, counterfeiting, or lying? Is not the whole law of honor founded upon the fact, that one man charges another as a forger or liar, and that the accused resents the charge? In the transactions of business, do we not often forge lies? Is not forgery a part of the skill of the accomplished warrior and hero? Are not most battles gained by stratagems and deceptions? Are not all wars, and their consequent despotisms, derived from some forgery of the divine will, without which the superstitious multitude never could be persuaded to risk their lives? So deep and indelible are the impressions of the divinity upon our consciences, that we cannot erase, though we may counterfeit them.The seventh action was for a nuisance. A public or common nuisance is, 'the doing of a thing to the annoyance of all, or the neglecting to do a thing which the common good requires.' A private nuisance is 'any thing done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another.' As our advocate prayed, 'lead us not into temptation,' he pitied the unhappy lot of men. They are tempted to fight for patriotism, only to lose the possession of their proportion of their country. Generals and patricians take possession of towns and counties, and the people are necessarily servants. Can there be a greater public nuisance than for one man to own a county? Is it not a common injury? Is it doing that which the common good requires? How much wiser would it be to conquer by reason and persuasion, than by force and law? When men shall conquer for the common good, and not for pride; when they shall do what the common good requires; when they shall no longer suffer the law to tempt and ruin nine tenths of our species, then we shall not think it honorable for us to become public nuisances, and to stand upon the necks of our fellow-men, and tell them it is a private nuisance for them to move.The eighth action was for treason a crime, like heresy, which means any thing, which the strongest is interested to punish. Socrates and our Savior were put to death as traitors. Millions have been executed as traitors, who would have been spared, had they been common prisoners of war as though it was more criminal to fight against an usurper at home than abroad: Traitors seldom have a fair trial, because they are not allowed to plead that the king has no right to his throne the question in dispute. Will there be any treason against the kingdom of heaven? Not owing its origin, like earthly kingdoms, to discord and treason, but to friendship and love, it will be the reign of reason, equity, equality, liberty. We pray for it daily. We ought also to labor for it; for, until its arrival, we shall, if true to our Savior, be always exposed to evils. If not to the penalties of treason. As treasons are frequent in small states, and rare in large ones, the people of all states are interested to be united together. Our Savior's command to be 'one,' has a political bearing, which ought not to be overlooked; for it would 'deliver us from the evils' of treasons, seditions and mobs.By constantly repeating the Lord's prayer, and applying it to his practice, our advocate was enabled to perceive the incongruity of the law with reason. By the same process, that he discovered the fatuity of law, the physician may discover the mad conduct of men in regard to health, the farmer in regard to agriculture, the mechanic in regard to skill, the merchant in regard to commerce. But parliament and kings are the representatives of all classes. If they should apply constitutions and governments to procure our daily bread, promote the forgiveness of injuries, to withdraw temptations and to deliver from evil, what revisions would there be in our charters, what changes in our measures? Happy will be the period, when millions of Christians shall constantly pray, 'thy kingdom come.' Every man then will seek to remedy some evil in his department of life, to obtain correct sentiments upon questions which distract mankind, and to unite those in charity who are divided in principle.              disguise, disguise disguise disguise disguise disguise disguise disguise             

            The granting of Faneuil Hall to the anti-slavery citizens of Boston, after so many refusals on the part of the City Authorities, is to be regarded as one of the most cheering signs of the times, and will carry dismay to the remotest corners of the South. We knew that this event would come to pass in all due time. Although no prophet, nor the son of a prophet, yet, in the darkest hour of the anti-slavery enterprise immediately after the great pro-slavery meeting held in Faneuil Hall in 1335, and just before we were so roughly handled by 'five thousand gentlemen of property and standing' in a letter addressed by us to Harrison Gray Otis, we said among other things in defence of our good cause'The SPIRIT OF SEVENTY-SIX shall yet rise from its ashes, and blot out that calumny! The cause of the bleeding slaves shall yet be pleaded in Faneuil Hall, in tones as thrilling, in language as stirring, in eloquence as irresistible, as were ever heard within its walls!'On Thursday forenoon, of last week, the doors were thrown wide open to the friends of immediate and unconditional emancipation, and most animating was the spectacle witnessed on that memorable occasion. Although the mercury ranged several degrees below zero, and there was no fire to warm the immense hall, yet there was no flinching on the part of those in attendance some three thousand persons, of both sexes. It was a time that tried the bodies as well as the souls of the audience. Every thing went off happily, and with rapturous applause. As no previous arrangement had been made, either in regard to the speakers, or the resolutions to be offered, all that was presented and said came forth spontaneously, affording an excellent variety of style and topics. The speakers were received with every demonstration of gladness, and we heard not a discordant note from any quarter of the hall; though some very severe things were said in some of the speeches, calculated to excite opposition, if there had been any hostile spirits in the assembly.Of the character of the speeches delivered on the occasion, some idea may be formed by reading the resolutions offered, and examining the list of speakers below. We regret that no reporter could be obtained; but as our bro. Leavitt, of the Emancipator, was present, who holds the pen of a ready writer, we shall probably have from his pen a sketch of some of the proceedings. As each resolution was presented to the meeting for adoption, the response that followed was tremendous. Not a voice was heard in the negative! Never since the walls of the venerable building first resounded to the inspiring appeals of the sons of Liberty, has there been greater unanimity of feeling manifested, or a more cordial reception given to the speakers in Faneuil Hall. How have the times changed within three years! Laus Deo'It was an affecting and thrilling sight to see the venerable SETH SPRAGUE, of Duxbury, (father of Peleg Sprague of this city,) stand up in the very place where his son stood in 1835, advocating with all his soul a cause which that son had so strongly reprobated as detrimental to the Union, and repugnant to the spirit of the U.S. Constitution. May it not be hoped, that the time is near at hand when the son shall in Faneuil Hall respond to the sentiments of the father, and publicly acknowledge a radical change in his views of the principles and measures of the abolitionists?     The cause of the bleeding slaves shall yet be pleaded in Faneuil Hall,     Laus Deo     

       ECCLESIASTICAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE TABERNACLE. Some notice of the proceedings now going on in the Broadway Tabernacle having gone abroad through the papers, we have obtained the following facts in the case, which we believe may be relied on.On the 24th Sept. last, there was a meeting of the members of the Broadway Tabernacle Presbyterian Church, to consider the subject of electing a pastor. The Rev. Joel Parker, of New Orleans, was nominated, and his fitness strongly urged. Mr. Lewis Tappan opposed his election for reasons assigned. A decided majority, however, voted in the affirmative, and Mr. Parker has been preaching ever since. Early in December, Mr. Tappan was active in circulating a CALL among the members of the church, to meet and form an anti-slavery society. On the 16th December, Mr. Parker, after the morning service, requested the members of the church to remain. He then read a paper, of considerable length, in the name of the Session, discountenancing the formation of any anti-slavery society in the congregation, &c. When he had concluded, Mr. Tappan asked permission to say a few words to the church, in explanation of the motives and objects of the abolitionists. Other members spoke on the subject, pro and con. On the 18th December, the Session of the Church issued a citation to Mr. Tappan, to appear before them on the 8th of January, to answer to the charge of 'disorderly and unchristian conduct.' This measure excited some remark in the community, and it was generally supposed that the citation had reference to anti-slavery action. When, however, the accused appeared before the session, on the 8th January, and asked for the specifications of the charge, he found to his surprise, and that of many others, that the charge was for slanderous words, &c, used at the meeting of the church on the 24th September!Mr. Tappan had employed a stenographer to go with him to the meeting, and preserve, for his use, a full and precise account of all that transpired; and he soon saw the necessity for such a step, for only a part of the proceedings were made the subject of record by the Session. At the commencement of the second evening, the Session excluded the stenographer. Having taken good advice, Mr. Tappan appeared the third evening with the stenographer, and insisted on his right to have all the proceedings taken down for his use. The whole evening was consumed in discussing the matter, and as the accused would not yield this point, the Session resolved that he be SUSPENDED from the communion of the church for CONTUMACY, until he shall give evidence of repentance. The accused has appealed to the Presbytery. A general sentiment of indignation has been expressed at the bold, unconstitutional, and tyrannical conduct of the Session. We leave to the religious newspapers the discussion of their part of the matter, having room only to mention the facts, and to observe, that as courts, both secular and ecclesiastical, are necessarily invested with great discretionary power, it is highly important to the protection of the subjects from remediless oppression, that all judicial proceedings should be open to public inspection.In connexion with the above, we have learned that a devoted abolitionist in Philadelphia has been suspended from the communion of a Presbyterian church in that city, for anti-slavery action. It is a remarkable coincidence, that the pastor of that church read to his flock, on the 16th December, a paper disapproving the formation of an anti-slavery society, and that the refractory member was cited to appear before the Session on the 8th January. Does a conspiracy exist in the Presbyterian church, to put down anti-slavery action among its members? We shall see. Emancipator.         on the th December, th January. Emancipator.   

 Resolutions passed in Faneuil Hall, at a meeting of the friends of the immediate Abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia.The meeting was organized by the choice of Francis Jackson, Esq. as Chairman, and J.A. Collins, as Secretary; opened with prayer by the Rev. Orange Scott, of Lowell; and after addresses were made by the Rev. Mr. May, of Scituate, J.W. Brown, Esq. of Lynn, Wendell Phillips, Esq. Wm. L. Garrison, Amasa Walker, Rev. Mr. Colver, and Edmund Quincy, Esq. of Boston, Rev. C.P. Grosvenor, of Worcester, Hon. Seth Sprague, of Duxbury, P.C. Pettibone, of Andover, and Rev. Joshua Leavitt, of New York, the following resolutions were adopted.Resolved, That the 'slaves of this country ought instantly to be set free, and brought under the protection of law.'Resolved, That 'immediate emancipation does not mean that the slaves shall be turned loose upon the nation,' but, among other things it does mean 'that, instead of being under the unlimited control of a few irresponsible masters, they shall really receive the protection of law' 'that every husband shall have his own wife, and every wife her own husband, both being united in wedlock according to its proper forms, and placed under the protection of law' that 'all trade in human beings shall be regarded as felony, and entitled to the highest punishment;' that 'all those laws which now prohibit the instruction of the slaves, shall be instantly repealed, and others enacted, providing schools and instruction for their intellectual illumination;' that such emancipation would 'give protection to millions who are now at the mercy of a few irresponsible masters and drivers,' so that 'every man and every woman may then find redress at law.'Resolved, 'That there are at the present time, the highest obligations resting upon the people of the free states, to remove slavery by moral and political action, as prescribed in the Constitution of the United States,' and that 'their relation to slavery is criminal, and must be broken up.'Resolved, That in all consistency 'the whole American people ought to be an Anti-Slavery Society; that this is the very first principle upon which our government is built; that the spirit of civil and religious liberty requires it; that the Declaration of '76, and the spirit and letter of our Constitution require it; and that we must be wholly inconsistent with ourselves, and the principles by which we profess to be governed, if we do not by every laudable exertion, 'endeavor, by all means sanctioned by law, humanity, and religion, to effect the abolition of slavery in the United States.'Resolved, That 'so long as slaves are held in the District of Columbia, and in the Territories of the United States, so long as ours is a representative government, subject to the will of the people: so long as Southern States deprive the colored citizens of New England, who may visit them, of their liberty and the rights of citizenship guarranteed to them by the Constitution of the United States: so long as slavery mars the harmony, divides the policy, retards the prosperity, and, fearfully threatens the existence of the nation: so long as the commands of Jesus remain binding upon all men, 'whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them:' so long as there remains any flesh in our hearts, any physical or moral affinity between us and our enslaved brethren, any love to God or man in our souls, it can never be true that the people of New England are not bound to use their moral and political power to overthrow slavery in the United States.'Resolved, That if from any place a voice of remonstrance should go forth in thunder-tones against the adoption of the infamous gag resolution in Congress, coming from any quarter, and especially from a recreant son of New England, denying to the people the sacred right of petition, and to their representatives the freedom of speech, that place above all others is Faneuil Hall; that we the people of this Commonwealth lift up that voice in one mighty burst, from full hearts, and with an unconquered and unconquerable spirit, and that, instead of tamely, submitting to this daring and despotic measure, we hereby pledge ourselves, before God and the world, that we will resist it in a manner worthy of freemen and Christians.Resolved, That Samuel Adams, and the other Fathers of American Independence, who have raised their voices in behalf of human rights, rejected and despised that false idea of liberty, which would compel even one of their fellow citizens to purchase his freedom by forsaking his country; and that we, breathing the same free spirit, and inheriting the same free principles, repudiate, as adverse to freedom and the rights of man, the American Colonization Society.Resolved, That when Doctors of Divinity teach the doctrine, that men are at liberty to pass by the suffering and down trodden slave, with no regard to his wrongs, when they write books for the purpose of so contracting the circle of Human Responsibility, that the slave shall be left outside of that circle, then the demand is imperative on every citizen to constitute himself a Doctor of Divinity, and spread out again this contracted circle to its original limits the limits of Universal Humanity.Resolved, That the Abolition Revolution of 1833, and the American Revolution of 1776, aimed at a similar object the enfranchisement of a whole nation.Resolved, That whether the members of Congress sustain freedom of speech in the Capitol or not, Massachusetts and Faneuil Hall are never gagged.Resolved, That the Resolutions of this meeting be transmitted to our Senators and Representatives in Congress, with a request to present them; and if they are not received and acted upon in a suitable manner, to return them, that they may be published to the world, as the evidence that the voice of Faneuil Hall can no longer be heard by American Legislators in the Halls of Congress.Voted, That so far as in us lies, we hereby revoke, rescind, and annul the resolutions passed by a meeting of citizens in this Hall in August, 1835, expressive of their sympathy with the slaveholders of the southern States.Voted, That these resolutions be published in the daily papers of this city.   Resolutions passed in Faneuil Hall, at a meeting of the friends of the immediate Abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia.                                FRANCIS JACKSON, Chairman.   J.A.

 FREE DISCUSSION. One of the friends of the new anti-Liberator paper, who is pledged to obtain a certain number of subscribers for it, in a letter to us, dated a fortnight since, says'I have thought it might be well to have a new paper, and have wanted to have a hand in it, that I might combat what I call your erroneous and dangerous opinions on some important subjects.'There are but two subjects discussed in the Liberator, either by us or our correspondents, viz. Abolition and Peace. On the former, our friend will not charge us with holding any erroneous or dangerous opinions. As to the latter, we advocate the universal forgiveness of enemies, for Christ's sake. If the doctrine be fallacious, it can be refuted in our own columns. What need, then, of a new paper?If any of our opinions are to be combatted by that paper, then, unless it disallow free discussion in its pages, it must admit our replies. In that case, how will it differ in its character from the Liberator?How can it avoid a discussion of the 'woman question,' as connected with the anti-slavery cause, except by refusing to be free and impartial? If it shall take sides against the women, and yet exclude articles in their defence, what better will it be than a cowardly and despotic periodical? If it shall tolerate a free discussion of the merits of that question, why on that ground will it not be just as objectionable as the Liberator?How can it avoid a discussion of the Peace question, as inseparably connected with the bloodless overthrow of slavery, except by refusing to admit articles into its columns on that subject? By this exclusion, it will show that it is unworthy the support of any free, inquiring mind. In tolerating such a discussion, in what respect will it be preferable to the Liberator?How if true to the cause of humanity can it avoid rebuking a corrupt priesthood and church, for their hostility to immediate emancipation? If it shall be faithful in this particular, why should it not give as much offence to both as the Liberator?If it shall undertake to decide that it is the religious duty of every abolitionist to go to the polls, how except by stifling all discussion can it refuse admittance to the other side? If the discussion be free on this subject, why should not the new paper be as objectionable as the Liberator? If it shall merely urge abolition voters to carry out their principles at the ballot-box, does not the Liberator do the same thing now?It will be well for some of those who are encouraging this schismatic project, in hopes of avoiding certain disagreeable topics, to pause and give due consideration to these questions. Whatever may be the state of things in other parts of the country, it is too late in the day, in this Commonwealth, to blink out of sight either the woman question or the Peace question, in any discussion connected with the abolition of American slavery.     combat what I call your erroneous and dangerous opinions

       There appears, in the last number of the London (Westminster) Review, an article occupying some thirty or forty octavo pages, from the pen of Miss MARTINEAU, entitled 'The Martyr-Age in the United States,' being a Review of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of 'RIGHT AND WRONG IN BOSTON.' This article has excited extraordinary interest in Great Britain, and obtained a most rapid sale. We understand it is to be published in pamphlet form, immediately, by two of our city booksellers. We have not seen it.

       We entreat our readers to give the proceedings of the free colored citizens of New-York and Philadelphia, relative to the Colonization Society, a careful perusal. (See first page.) They speak volumes as to the feelings with which that Society is regarded by those whose welfare it hypocritically pretends to seek. It received in this city, last week, two sentences of public condemnation on the same day on in Faneuil Hall, and the other in the Hall of the House of Representatives. It shall be execrated universally.

 To CORRESPONDENTS. A large number of communications, on a variety of topics, are omitted for want of room, but shall appear soon.J.H.W. of Pawtucket, is informed that we shall commence publishing his essay against the Non-Resistance doctrines, soon. As the manuscript is somewhat voluminous, (it being, in substance, a reply to H.C. Wright, in a public debate,) we did not feel authorised to divide the argument, until we received a note from the author, allowing us to do so. He shall be fully and fairly heard in our columns at any time.An explanatory letter from Mr. St. Clair next week.Also, a similar letter from Mr. Phelps.Also, the doings of several anti-slavery societies, disapproving of the Fitchburg resolutions.We cannot possibly find room, this week, for the communication of 'A Moral, but not a Political Abolitionist.' It is quite apparent to us that the author is a politician, and that his advice to anti-slavery lecturers not to touch upon politics in the Fourth District, proceeds from his anxiety to secure the re-election of William Parmenter! Does not the writer know that 'an old bird is not to be caught with chaff'? In one thing we unite with him most heartily and that is, in deploring the scenes of excitement that were witnessed at the annual meeting of the State Society last week.             is

 We understand that our bro. J.V. HIMES will preach at the Chardon-Street Chapel on Sunday afternoon, Feb. 3, on the subject of 'African Missions.' We opine it will be a discourse far different from Elliot Cresson's, and trust the house will be filled to overflowing.   African Missions.

 Great Fire in Boston. On Thursday morning last, the thermometer being at nine degrees below zero, and the wind very high, a fire broke out in the iron foundry on Haverhill street, and was soon driven with great fury upon buildings on the adjoining streets, Market, Beverly, Charlestown, Cooper and Endicott. The loss of property is estimated at nearly $80,000 of which but a small part is insured.   Great Fire in Boston.
