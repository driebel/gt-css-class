     MARLBOROUGH, Oct. 18, 1839.   DEAR SIR:Yours in behalf of the Middlesex Co. A.S. Society, was not received till some days after its date, nor have I been able to make an earlier reply.In answer to your first question, permit me to say, (if I did not say it with sufficient distinctness in my reply to a letter from your society last year,) that I am opposed to the existence of slavery in the District of Columbia, as every where in the universe of God; in body or in mind; in time, or in eternity. And so have I been from the earliest moments of reflection.I believe it to be one of the greatest anomalies in political economy and morals, that, while the 'assembled wisdom' of a Republic are shouting in their Congress-halls, the sentiment, that 'all men are born free and equal,' there should be mingled with the sound, and almost on the very spot, the voice of the auctioneer in the sale of his kind. I shall be glad, therefore, to use such means as are justifiable in my mind to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. But, touching the subject of instructing our Senators in Congress, &c. I have only to say, in substance, what I said last year that I hold our Senators and Representatives in Congress bound to represent the wishes of those who clothe them with their trust. And when they are, by the process of their election, made fully acquainted with the views and wishes of those who elect them, and when they indeed are elected in reference to their opinions on great and leading subjects of political concern, it appears to me improper, and that it could avail nothing, for any other than the people whom they represent, to instruct them.2. You ask, 'Are you in favor of the Legislature of Massachusetts protesting against the admission into the union of any new State, whose Constitution tolerates slavery?I answer. In the event that Congress were called to act on the admission of such a state, I should certainly be in favor of the Legislature of Massachusetts protesting Against it.Your 3d question is 'Are you in favor of repealing all laws of this state, which make distinction among men on account of color?'In answer to this question, I have to say, that, while I confess, that from the limited examination I have given the subject, my mind is not perfectly clear thereon; yet, with my present impressions, were I called to act, I should be in favor of the repeal of the laws of which you speak.In closing, let me say, I have given my opinions in candor, and without reserve, and without the least desire to influence any votes in reference to the office for which my name is before the public, as a candidate. I am no aspirant for, neither am I solicitous of office. And if my fellow citizens wish to command my services at any post, I shall expect the votes which express their desire to be what I wish the slave to be, and what I shall strive to keep myself FREE.      every where   Republic auctioneer            slave    Very respectfully, yours,THOS. J. GREENWOOD.    DR. H. COWDREY.    

          [ ] Western Reserve Anti-Slavery Convention to the Citizens of the Western Reserve, on the subject of POLITICAL ACTION.Resolved, That Abolitionists ought not, and that we will not, vote for any man for any Legislative or Executive office, who is not heartily opposed to Slavery and who will not openly meet and honestly [ ] all constitutional measures, calculated immediately restore to the oppressed their rights.. . . Slavery not only suborns our legislation into her service, but falsely pretends to derive a sacred sanction from our constitution. It sets up a market for the bodies and souls of man in our national capital, and shakes its bloody manacles at the doors of our national Congress. In virtue of its increased ratio of representation, it goes into Congress and votes there to make laws for northern freemen. We are taxed to maintain a standing army for its defence, and its minions solace themselves with the thought, that, if extreme oppression shall torture the slaves into rebellion, northern arms must be forced to put them down. In their measures they admit of no compromise. They now openly declare that no man shall be elected to the Chief Magistracy of the nation, who is not pledged to support the system, and the two prominent candidates for the chief executive office have accordingly handed in their pledges. By machination and chicanery they control our national policy, give supremacy to schemes, the secret of which is the upholding of the slaveholding interest, and boast that, as they always have overreached the north and ruled the nation, so they always will, and that the whole clan of northern voters shall cost them on an average no more than sixpence a head. They render our public councils riotous and intolerant, and maltreat and threaten our representatives and senators in their sents. In Congress, whatever militates against slavery or slaveholding policy, they treat with ineffable and equal contempt, whether it be the resolutions of the legislatures or the petitions of the people. Considering that northern commerce is prejudicial to their interests, they avow their determination to 'Break it down at all hazards.' They use their influence to make free labor disreputable and to reduce its profits. They insult northern freemen by likening them to their own bondmen, and by declaring that their system must soon become co-extensive with, and the radical principles of the republic. The very breath of slavery is a pestilential miasma, which has tainted and diseased our moral and political sentiments, and lamentably weakened our sense of justice. It has sullied the glory of our nation, and brings our fair institutions into contempt throughout the world.We now ask you if aside from the cause of the three millions of the enslaved in the states, and their countless posterity, and the rights of the fifty thousand slaves under the national control, whether enough has not been shown to convince you that the times are more ominous of evil than they have before been since the days of the Revolution. And we ask what is to be done to succor our decayed and threatened liberties. We have called upon our public men. A few have responded like patriots, and placing themselves in the breach, have done what they could. Their names we honor, their memory we embalm in our hearts. But the majority, under the influence of the two great parties which overshadow the land, have returned upon us abuse and scorn. Their leaders vie with each other in subserviency to the slaveholding power; and well-knowing that the genius of slavery allows of no toleration and no compromise, they abjectly join themselves to the train that follows chained to her car, ready to receive the gift of power at her hand to be exercised according to her will. Our petitions they lay aside with contempt, and deliberately pass resolutions to stifle us and our advocates. What shall we next do? Continue our votes to keep such men in office? Never! We stepped not out of our political sphere in aught that we asked of them; neither do we now, while, in the exercise of our unquestionable prerogative; we advance a step, and say, you can no longer receive our votes, be they few or many, for you have failed to merit them. You have calculated by the overweening influence of party to draw us aside from the great objects before us, and by distracting our minds and engrossing our interest with minor objects, to avail yourselves of that power and influence, which our country has placed in our hands to be exercised for her weal. We acknowledge with regret, that our past course has given you some reason to suppose that we should yield assent to your claim of a sort of acquired property in us. The ties of party are not easily loosed. We have waited for a change with too great patience, while you have mocked us and our cause, and set at nought the best interests of your country. But, if you reckon farther upon our feally, you reckon without your host. Sooner will we see you and your parties sink into oblivion with a millstone around your necks, than lend our votes to uphold your traitorous and abandoned course. We need no one to tell us that a vote withheld may be more influential than a vote given. We have no secrets. We address you plainly. We are well aware of the advantages of our situation, and of your needs. Our votes are our own, and we can if necessary be constant to our point for years. We have not entered lightly upon this matter. We have no organization sufficiently active and efficient for all our purposes. Our compatriots are unsure passed in the land for intelligence and integrity, and they have enlisted in this cause not through fear nor hope of favor. Their hatred of all oppression, their attachment to justice, to their own and their country's rights, and the universal rights of man, are their bond of union and the best warrant of their constancy. Their demands are of the most reasonable character. We ask you not to relinquish any party object, if so be you have any. If we have our sine qua non, you also have yours. You ask that every candidate exactly fit the Procrustes bed of party. We ask that in the present necessary of the state, he shall pledge himself to oppose the encroachments of the slave-holding power, to vote for the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade wherever the same is under the national control, to act for the repeal of the odious statutes which now disgrace a state nominally free, and to stand up as the advocates of human rights, the inalienable rights of man, and the common enjoyment of those privileges which all free countries grant alike to all the upright members of the body politic. We ask you candidly, if the man who refuses to do this is worthy to receive the vote of a freeman. We extend this pledge only to the executive office of the state and nation, for to the correct exercise of their functions must we look for the political remedy of the evils of which we complain.The reason why we set up no candidates of our own, is not that we doubt our right so to do, but simply because we deem it inexpedient. For as we believe there is in the breasts of the people, an inherent love of what is just and true, as the merits of prejudice are fast being dispelled, and the floods of persecuting waters sent out to drown our cause, have lost their power to harm it; we are confident that it will soon be espoused by the multitude of the lovers of liberty of every name among the people. Already is the great question of slavery and its bearings in their hearts, nor can party dictation, nor the torrents of abuse or misrepresentation, which may be poured out, prevent its becoming the rallying point of numbers. Our cause is that of the Revolution, and we are as confident of its success as we are of the ultimate triumph of truth and justice. We are backed up by the sense and the inestimable moral force of the whole civilized world. We act in a line with christianity, with the march of modern civilization and enlightenment. The principles of our cause are fundamental in the social organization and civil codes of all free states, and they embody the moving and revolutionizing power of the present age. Let politicians and parties beware how they set themselves against such a movement. Let the public men who have made light of our cause in time past, remember that their votes are all treasured up and recorded against their names, and that the day either of reformation or retribution is at hand.The abolitionists of the Reserve, we exhort to firmness in the position now so unanimously taken by those who think with them throughout the United States. Great consequences wait the result of your unity and firmness. Every finesse will be used to drive you from your purposes without acknowledging your principles. Your partiality for particular men will be used as a means to shake your constancy. But what will it advantage you or your country, to give Clay, Van Buren, or any other particular man an office, while they are pledged to the support of the slaveholding interest? As the primitive St. Ambrose repulsed the favorite Emperor of Rome, declaring that he could have no part in things holy, whose hands were stained with innocent blood, so should you be careful not to prostitute the trust your country has reposed in you, by lending your votes to give sanction or honor to men implicated in upholding the foul and bloody system of slavery. If your party attachments are appealed to, and you cannot in an emergency, like the present, break the tie that binds you, ask yourselves if the fact is not, in itself, a bondage, inconsistent with the independence of a freeman. Should you be told that you will throw away your vote, see in the very solicitation and clamor that is raised, proof to the contrary. Are you taunted with the feebleness and fewness of your friends? It is the taunt of ignorance fatal to itself. Fifty thousand votes ready to be given or withheld, as circumstances may demand, is far from a condition of weakness. And who that possesses the independent soul of a freeman, though the world should leave him alone, would vote for men constantly engaged in reviling him and his principles. It is suggested that your method of action is futile and vain. Be assured that this is the only method that has ever secured the success of minorities. It is no strange or new thing, as some would fain have us believe. Not a county asks the construction of a petty rail road, without assuming it as a familiar and successful course of action.This method was pursued by the abolitionists, who engaged in the contest with slavery, which about forty years ago began in the heart of the slave-dealing interest in Rhode Island, and sped triumphantly through the New England States, and from thence through New York to New Jersey. In the state of New York, the contest was maintained for several years, and ceased by the strict adherence of the abolitionists of that day to this simple principle of refusing to vote for any man who would not act for the abolition of slavery in that state. The same course was deliberately adopted by the abolitionists of England, and after a protracted struggle, they triumphantly carried the men who pledged themselves to their cause into the House of Commons, whether whigs or not; and have now made their principles supreme throughout the British Empire.This method of action undoubtedly requires constancy, and may require time, but the first requisite had, success is an certain as time is sure. The principle of this course of action is simple, and easy to be apprehended by all. There cannot be general concentration upon every point at once. Men when they rally must choose among the things most important to be attained or avoided. If those which are immeasurably greatest in importance, are set aside by the shape and direction which has been given to politics, we give or withhold our votes, as the case may be, in such a manner as to secure to the subject in hand, proper attention and action. Neither in such a case are we reduced to the dilemma in which the politicians, by forestalling the people by caucus nominations, would place us the choice of two evils. By refusing both, we may attain a far greater good. We are in the habit of giving our votes far too easily. Those who are more chary of them, turn the table on the politicians, and reduce them to the dilemma of losing their votes, or setting up candidates who can in conscience be voted for. You have always demanded certain requisites before they could receive your votes. You will not vote for drunken, vicious, or abandoned characters, by whatever party set up. For the elevation of such men to office and honor must, as a general principle, produce infinitely more harm than their election can do good. Parties always have been and always will be governed, in the nomination of candidates, by the qualifications which the people require before they render their votes.The adoption of this mode of action by individual voters, is all that is required to give success to our cause, and produce a more thorough regeneration of politics than any or all party measures ever devised.Meetings of all the township societies are expected to be held to take this subject into consideration. The county society in each county, will take means to ascertain and make public the sentiments of all candidates for all state and national offices. The political sentiments of all who ask to represent us, we have the most undoubted right to know. We do not ask the parties to surrender any legitimate object. We ask nothing to which any good man or any patriot cannot say, yea. He, who in the present emergency answers insincerely, or evades or refuses to answer, is no better for us than the open advocate of slavery and all its projects. We have already no want of men who will do nothing. We must have those who will stand in the breach and resist; who will force back aggression and vindicate the law, the Constitution and the right. Whether such shall be the issue of the present contest depends on you. But do not imagine that one year will bring a final decision. You had better not enlist in this contest, unless you can do it for the war; unless, as you draw the sword, you can throw away the scabbard, and forget personal rewards and minor objects, while you strike home for principle, for country, and for God.In the history of every nation, there are frequent crises when the defence of the liberties of the land, devolve upon a comparatively few, and those few, men whose names for the time are cast out as evil. This is as often the case in republics as in other forms of government. We hesitate not to say, that upon the abolitionists of this land, in the providence of God, is this sacred trust and high duty now devolved. May they have wisdom, that they may well acquit themselves to their country and before Him.  [ ] Western Reserve Anti-Slavery Convention to the Citizens of the Western Reserve, on the subject of       sine qua non,                  

       Do the visitors at the Anti-Slavery Fair believe this assertion? Why should they not? It is current throughout the land; and many an individual, occupying some high place in Church or State, declares it to be true. Will such a man tell a falsehood? Must not popular rumor be credited? What motive have the 'wise,' the 'mighty,' and the 'honorable,' for giving utterance to that which they know is unfounded? Therefore, it must be so 'abolition is dying away!'Is it? Let the assertion be granted, for argument's sake what then? Should it be repeated exultingly, as something worth boasting about? Who would rejoice at the fact so much as the traders 'in slaves and souls of men? And when such monsters chuckle, must not their victims groan? If they hope, if they report that 'abolition is dying away,' must it not be because they know that abolition, by its prevalence, will destroy their horrible traffic, take away their unrighteous gains, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor'? Does it not prove that the friends of abolition are enlisted in a righteous cause, and deserve to be sustained and cheered onward by every lover of his race? Does it not also demonstrate, that those at the North who are arraying themselves against the anti-slavery cause, are in fact 'striking hands with thieves, and consenting with adulterers'?What is abolition? It is the recognition of man as man, as an equal being, the world over, irrespective of his origin, complexion or condition. It is the antagonist of slavery in every form, whether that slavery be 'personal or political, mental or corporeal, intellectual or spiritual.' It is the advocacy of the inalienable right of man to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' It is 'full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy' cordially embracing the truth, that 'God hath made of one blood all nations of men,' and maintaining that as He is no respecter of persons, so ought not man to be toward his fellow-man. In short, it is the incarnation of humanity, of freedom, of justice.If, then, 'abolition is dying away,' it is a sign that the love of liberty is dying, that our country is dying! And it shows that this is not a time to be merry, but a time for mourning and lamentation. In proportion to the peril by which we are surrounded, should be our efforts to preserve ourselves and the nation from destruction.What is 'dying away'? Is it steady, perpetual growth? Is it life and immortality? Is it the infusion of new vitality into the veins and arteries of the body politic? Is it victory over every assailing force? Is it an increase of power by every conflict with evil? Then, indeed, 'abolition is dying away!' If this be death, what is life?The pro-slavery cry of 'dying away,' is but the shriek of despair! It comes forth convulsively, from quivering lips and trembling hearts. It is the death-knell of slavery. Never was abolition so zealous, so enterprising, so powerful, so successful, so full of health and vigor, as it is at the present hour! Never before were its advocates so numerous, or its conquests over ignorance, prejudice and hatred so brilliant and rapid! All sects and parties are fast becoming influenced by it, and no earthly power is able to arrest its progress.But is there not a division in the anti-slavery ranks, and does that not prove that 'abolition is dying away'? True, there is such a division in this Commonwealth, yet only to a very slight extent. It is local, not national. The great mass of the abolitionists of Massachusetts are sound to the core, and were never more united in spirit than at the present time. Before the enemies of abolition should lift up the voice of exultation, in view of this schism, let them first pause, and inquire into the nature of it? Has it originated in any diversity of sentiment among abolitionists, as to the exceeding sinfulness of slaveholding, and the duty of immediate emancipation? Are they divided in opinion, respecting the guilt of southern slaveholders the unspeakable baseness of expatriating men on account of their complexion the right of the slave to stand on the same platform with his master? If so, then it is possible that 'abolition is dying away.' But it is not so. The division is the offspring of personal dislike, of sectarian exclusiveness, of political ambition. It is not possible for it long to survive in this free and enlightened Commonwealth.Look into the Fair! What a profusion of rare and beautiful articles lies [ ] upon one long . . . that circle the spacious hall! Is it an evidence of life or death? of strength or weakness? of an onward or a retrograde movement? of union or division? Those articles are the handi-work of a portion of the anti-slavery women of this Commonwealth. Think, for a moment, how many heads and hearts must have been exercised to produce so splendid and costly a result! What substantial tokens of tireless industry, superior skill, noble generosity, and rare devotedness to the cause of bleeding humanity! This is abolition does it look like 'dynig away'? Blessings on the women of this ancient Commonwealth! So long as they exist, it can never be true that the cause of emancipation is on the wane.           is         

         We received, week before last, a keen and well couched communication, on this subject, from our valued correspondent C.N. Absence last week prevented our taking the special notice of it we intended to. As to the understanding hinted at for the exclusion of the slave's plea, as well as for a general taunting of the abolitionists, we have no doubt it exists. Our clerical anti-abolitionists are no doubt determined, jointly as well as severally, that anti-slavery shall never rise in the congregation high enough to beat against the base of the pulpit never be permitted to swell in the sanctuary, so that the bottom stair shall not be high and dry above its high-water mark among the people. To this end there is undoubtedly a common understanding. They make each other acquainted with their mutual grievances and the names and offences of obnoxious, insubordinate individuals the Mordecais, who wear their abolition hats in the papal gates. All this is natural and it is evident in fact. But it is short-sighted. It is impotent to the end it aims at. It cannot accomplish it. It will put down nobody but those who practise it. It yields a momentary gratification to shoot from behind the pulpit impart the coward shot that cannot be returned at the time and on the spot. We have witnessed much of this. We have heard our cause and its advocates cowardly assailed from that point of inglorious safety and impunity. But it will shortly work its own cure. It makes abolitionists, and it awakens those that are already so, to a sense of their duty, by a sense of their own degradation and insult. They need infliction to arouse them, and nothing brings the plantation to such lively remembrance as this cart-whip ecclesiastical.We warn our ministerial brethren of the hazard of their procedure. They will find themselves mistaken even in this sort of exchange mutual insurance. They mistake the people and they mistake themselves and every body, but the abolitionists, whose shoulders are indeed like Issachar's, and who will bear, as they justly suppose, almost any burdens they may choose to lay on them. But they will feel eventually. A highway is cutting by the pro-slavery ministers direct and straight to the gult of dismission. The time is at hand, when no confidence will be placed by this community in a pro-slavery divine when the people will not brook pro-slavery pastorage. They will indignantly distrust the guidance and teachings of men, who, to humor the wicked caprices of their congregations, and maintain that sort of influence which a minister never ought to possess, will wink at the annihilation of human rights. And such men ought to be distrusted and every where abandoned. The cause of religion demands it.We shrewdly guess the pontificate, under which our friend C.N. sits though we wish he could feel himself at liberty to give the readers of the Herald his name and place. We know it would endanger him unless he is a bold farmer, who is independent of every thing but Providence, as a patriot farmer may be, and he alone, almost. If we don't mis-guess our correspondent's latitude, from the tyranny to which he alludes, he helps sustain as supercilious a piece of Protestant infallibility, as can be found this side Rome a real Leo or Innocent, who would ham-string an abolition heretic or burn him at the stake, if the times warranted such expression of papal displeasure. We lament the existence of such character among us. We lament it for the slave. We lament it for the exposed country. We do not however, agree with our able correspondent 'Despondency' in his opinion, that we must have the co-operation of such, men, before the anti-slavery enterprise can triumph. The Clergy, the Presidents, Professors and Preceptors they are not essential to our cause, though they have hitherto, greatly embarrassed and hindered us. They are not essential to our cause though our cause may be to them. We can, by the blessing of God, get on with it, without them. They cannot get on long, against anti-slavery. It will by and by grind them to powder. They might have aided us. They ought to. They should have been foremost in the cause. Their position gave them opportunity of immense advantage to us. They used it on the side of slavery. They will find eventually they did it to their own hurt. They are for maintaining the horrid system in the midst of their policy as the politicians are in the midst and as foundations of theirs. Southern ecclesiastical favor and patronage is as much sought by the northern divinity, as southern votes are by northern party. The infernal idol is bowed down to by sect and by demagogue party throughout the North. It is the Rimmon and Moloch of the country, the object of universal worship, and the fiery furnace is threatened all those insubordinates, who will not fall down to it, at the sound of sacbur, &c.We go no longer to supplicate the Andover theology, to espouse the cause of the slave. It has been supplicated too much and too long already. All there was of heart, and genuine philanthropy in it, is with us. And it is deserving of all honor. For no man sacrifices or hazards more by becoming an abolitionist than the minister. His relation to the people is one full of delicacy. It is fraught with sore influences upon his independence, and upon theirs also; influences which it becomes the church solemnly to consider, as to their effect upon the progress of Christ's Kingdom in the earth. We appeal to the freer occupation and professions in the land. First of all the farmer. His calling brings him nearest to Providence. His patrons are no more capricious and fickle ones, than the variable seasons the sunshine and the rain. For the faithfulness of these, he has the arched pledge of the Ruler of the seasons imprinted on the cloud. Next the unbought mechanic, who looks to God and his own good arm, when they bid him compromise his principles for popular favor. The young man of every fair profession. There is abolition in his free and generous time of life, if not cramped and perverted by other influences. As to literary teachers, there is one class we have access to, a free and unshackled one, the teacher in the common school. He stands in direct contact with the rising generation the germinating people. He is free. He has nothing to do with patronage. Let us have him, and pro-slavery may keep the mercenary Preceptor, the Professor, and the President.  understanding jointly severally, permitted insubordinate papal   ministerial brethren exchange mutual insurance. they eventually. pastorage. and every where abandoned.   pontificate, mis-guess infallibility, Rome ham burn insubordinates,   his theirs variable young common school. patronage.   

       In another column will be found the report of the somewhat remarkable proceedings of this Society, at its recent meetings in this city. We place great reliance upon the accuracy of this report, not only as it bears upon its face the evidence of candor and impartiality, but because we believe its author to be incapable of any intentional departure from strict verity. Of course, our columns are open to any correction of its statements, if any member of the Society shall deem them to be erroneous. In a controversy so painful and deplorable, we should regret giving publicity to aught but the truth; and the truth in this case, we fear, is sufficiently humiliating, without the aid of any misrepresentation of motives, or misconception of facts.From the formation of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society to the present time, we have felt a deep interest in its welfare, and regarded its union and efficiency as of great importance to the anti-slavery cause. Its seed was sown in weakness, and has since been raised in power. For a time, it grew feebly, and attracted but little attention. When, however, the community began to be filled with excitement, and a storm of opposition burst over the whole land, the aspect of this Society suddenly became elevated, and its spirit grand and martyr-like. The acquisition to its membership of a Chapman, a Child, a Weston, a Loring, a Sergeant, a Southwick, and other kindred minds, gave it not only a solid dignity of character, but new and quenchless vitality. Its light was radiated in every direction, and was distinctly seen even across the Atlantic. The annual Report of the Society, from the pen of Mrs. Chapman, was looked for with intense interest, from year to year, not merely as a Report, but as forming a most important part of the anti-slavery history of the United States. It was composed of 'thoughts that breathe, and words that burn,' and was not less a terror to evil-doers than a praise to them that do well. Its brilliancy and power were such as to extend its circulation in all parts of the country, and to awaken the admiration of the abolitionists of Great Britain, who were animated afresh to labor in the cause of universal emancipation, by a perusal of its glowing pages. The various female anti-slavery societies in the land justly regarded this Society as pre-eminent on the score of zeal, ability and enterprise. Though its members were drawn from all classes in the community, by that affinity of humanity which is stronger than all the artificial ties and vain distinctions of life, they met together in the spirit as well as the form of equality, and mingled like kindred drops into one the rich and poor, the educated and ignorant, those who had ten talents, those who had one. Though they widely differed in their religious sentiments, they forgot to what sect they belonged when deliberating for the slave's redemption; and love, and good-will, and mutual respect, characterised all their proceedings. No marvel, therefore, that they were enabled to 'smile at Satan's rage,' and face unshrinkingly those genteel rioters, the 'gentlemen of property and standing,' by whom they were brutally assailed in the memorable crisis of our cause, in the autumn of 1835. Alas! that they are not now, what they once were, a loving and an united body!Not that the Society does not still contain within itself a large amount of disinterested philanthropy and commanding talent; but, as a body, it has undergone a change in spirit 'the gold has become dim, and the most fine gold changed.'The defection in the Society began at the time of the Clerical Appeal conspiracy; and, from that hour till now, the spirit of sectarianism has held a majority of its members in servile fetters. That Appeal ought to have been promptly denounced by the Society; but no action was taken upon it. The golden opportunity to give still greater lustre to the exalted character of the Society was left unimproved, and, consequently, the free spirit of the association was so longer in the ascendant. The Society, as such, is unquestionably alienated from the old organization, and controlled by those who have got up the new (but not less odious) conspiracy. Its vitality is with the minority, whose efforts to restore it to its former purity are worthy of all praise. Let them persevere, and possess their souls in patience, looking with all confidence for a better state of things.    universal        

         The semi-annual meeting of this Society was held in the Methodist meeting-house in Duxbury, on Tuesday last, Oct. 22. It was a most delightful and interesting occasion. A large number of the tried friends of emancipation, both men and women, from various towns in the county, were present, 'of one heart and of one mind.' The President having called the meeting to order, prayer was offered by Charles Simmons, of North Scituate. The following persons were then appointed a Business Committee: S J. May, W.L. Garrison, C. Simmons, J.A. Collins, and  Smith. The following resolutions were subsequently presented by the Committee for the adoption of the Society:Whereas, the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society stands publicly accused, by a rival society and its official organ, of being 'perverted to purposes and objects not contemplated in our bond of union' of attaching to the cause 'a mill-stone to sink to the depths of the bottomless ocean the hopes or enslaved millions' of 'dishonorable conduct and conscious wrong-doing' of abandoning 'the original doctrines and measures of our associations' of adopting 'non-political, non-government abolition' of having 'fallen,' and 'thrown away its principles, and with them the staff of its power'And whereas, those accusations are vital, and if true, place the State Anti-Slavery Society on the same corrupt level with the Colonization and American Union Societies, and call for its immediate abandonment by every friend of bleeding humanity; but, if slanderous, should be made to recoil upon those who have circulated them through the land; therefore,Resolved, That this Society deems it due to the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, and its Board of Managers, to renew its expression of unwavering confidence in their principles and measures of its gratitude for the consistent, straight-forward, uncompromising rectitude of their course, and their steadfast refusal to proscribe from the anti-slavery platform, any person who believes in the duty of immediate and unconditional emancipation; and that we repudiate the accusations of the new organization as flagrantly unkind and cruel.Resolved, That this Society regards the formation of the Massachusetts Abolition Society as calculated to retard the progress of our holy enterprise as uncalled for and as originating in sectarian and personal feelings, rather than in any special regard for the purity of the anti-slavery association; and we trust it will be discountenanced by every true-hearted abolitionist.Whereas, it was the grand object of the anti-slavery association, from the beginning, to secure the co-operation of all sects and parties for the overthrow of slavery, without conspiring their destruction; and whereas, we have still unwavering confidence in the power of truth to overcome the opposition of these sects and parties, and to induce them to espouse the righteous cause of immediate and unconditional emancipation; therefore,Resolved, That this Society learns with deep regret, and strong disapprobation of the act, that, in certain sections of our land, proposals have been made, by professed abolitionists, to organize a distinct political party; that abolition tickets, in several instances, have already been put in nomination; and that even the organ of the American Anti-Slavery Society the Emancipator instead of deprecating, seems rather disposed to approbate such conduct.Resolved, As the settled conviction of this Society, that an attempt to organize such a party, by abolitionists, would convict them of gross inconsistency, create hurtful divisions in our ranks, change the present disinterested aspect of our cause, unite both of the great political parties in invincible hostility to that which they now to some extent fear and respect, induce a multitude of unprincipled men to rally under the abolition standard merely for 'the loaves and fishes of office,' and thus put in imminent peril the integrity and success of the anti-slavery enterprise.Resolved, That the policy which has been pursued by abolitionists, hitherto, not to form a separate political organization, but to bestow their votes irrespective of party names and badges, according to the anti-slavery character of rival candidates, is safe, wise and magnanimous, and, if steadfastly pursued, cannot fail to be crowned with success.Resolved, That, in the present new crisis, it be recommended to anti-slavery societies and newspapers, in this Commonwealth and elsewhere, to record their testimony, without delay, against every proposition for abolitionists to organize themselves into a political party.Whereas, the annual State election is at hand and whereas, abolition electors stand pledged to wield their political influence for such candidates as are understood to be in favor of immediate emancipation therefore,Resolved, That no consistent abolitionist will aid in electing any man to the State or National legislature, who is not in favor of immediate emancipation.Resolved, That this society recommends to the abolitionists of the several towns throughout this county, to interrogate candidates for the State legislature, as to their views on the subject of slavery and the marriage law.Whereas, it is one of the principal objects to which abolitionists, by the anti-slavery constitution, stand pledged, to elevate the free people of color, and to give their testimony against all prejudice, and all legislative enactments which are based on the complexion of the skin; and whereas abolitionists cannot successfully prosecute the cause of emancipation, so long as the relies of slavery cover our statute-book; therefore,Resolved, That the marriage law of this Commonwealth, making distinction among its inhabitants on account of their complexion, is anti-christian and unconstitutional; anti-christian, because it is a virtual trampling upon that declaration of Jehovah, 'What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder;' unconstitutional, inasmuch as it deprives the people of this State of the free exercise of their inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness; and ought, therefore, to be immediately repealed.Resolved, That consistent abolitionists will not fail to send, forthwith, to the Senate and House of Representatives of this Commonwealth, their petitions for the immediate abrogation of that odious law.Whereas, great efforts have been made, by the enemies of human freedom, to cast odium upon those women who petitioned the State legislature, at its last session, for the repeal of all existing laws proscribing and degrading a portion of the people of this Commonwealth on account of their complexion therefore,Resolved, That the women of Dorchester, Lynn and other towns, by thus giving their public testimony against those laws, are entitled to the thanks of the friends of humanity and virtue; and we recommend to the women of this Commonwealth to follow their example.Whereas, Bishop Heading has publicly declared, in a letter just published in the Rochester (N.Y.) Freeman, that 'the apostles laid down principles, which, when received, will destroy slavery' therefore,Resolved, That, according to the Bishop's admission, those churches and ministers, which connive at or justify slavery, are neither apostolic ministers or churches; and that the advice of the last General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church, to 'wholly refrain' from urging the abolition of slavery in that church, was in opposition to apostolic principles.Resolved, That if it is inconsistent, with the high professions of abolitionists, to vote for men to fill the offices of State, who refuse to use their utmost constitutional power to break the fetters of the slave, it is certainly as wide a departure from truth and duty, to support in any way those ministers and churches, whose whole power is not used for the liberation of the suffering bondman in our land; because the standard of morals in the world will be governed by the standard of the church; and because we can never have a free State, so long as we have a slaveholding Church.Resolved, That those Theological Seminaries in our land, which are conducted by pro-slavery men, are gross impositions the great counterfeiting establishments of the Prince of darkness, by which he palms upon Christendom, as the genuine ministers of Jesus, those who barter away the souls of immortal beings for the meagre reward of popular favor.Resolved, That those American churches which support by their contributions either pro-slavery ministers, or pro-slavery news-papers, are guilty before the world of squandering away the Lord's money.Whereas, The spirit of unhallowed sectarianism, among professed Christians, is a formidable barrer to the success of christianity; therefore,Resolved, That the cordial welcome of all persons friendly to the immediate abolition of slavery, to anti-slavery associations and action, irrespective of sectarian differences, but in the practice of free discussion and forbearance, is essential to the success of the anti-slavery enterprise.Resolved, That the abolition of slavery is a work of the Lord, to which all mankind should willingly devote themselves; but that American citizens who refuse their aid to this work, thereby peril their own happiness, and their national union and prosperity.Resolved, That in the death of BENZAMIN LUNDY, the early, faithful and indefatigable pioneer in the anti-slavery enterprise, 'our fellow-countrymen in chains' have lost a zealous advocate, and the nation a most worthy citizen, whose name deserves to be cherished to the latest posterity with that of a Wilberforce, a Clarkson, and a Howard.Resolved, That we earnestly call upon the abolitionists of the Old Colony to take immediate measures to furnish every family in their respective towns with a copy of the Anti-Slavery Almanac for 1840; believing that if this were done, it would contribute much to the advancement of our great and glorious cause.The foregoing resolutions were ably discussed by Messrs. May, Garrison, Collins, Thompson, Simmons and others, and were unanimously adopted by the society. The vote to sustain the State Society, and reprobating the new organization, was taken by rising.At the close of the meeting in the afternoon, nearly two hundred persons partook of an entertainment prepared by the Duxbury Female Anti-Slavery Society. In the evening, Mr. Garrison delivered an address to a crowded assembly, which was listened to with marked attention; at the close of which, it wasVoted. That the thanks of the Society be given to the ladies of the Duxbury A.S. Society for their hospitable entertainment, and also to the Methodist church and congregation for the use of their meeting-house.Voted. That the proceedings of this meeting be forwarded to the Liberator and Cradle of Liberty, and the several newspapers in the county for publication.

 PLYMOUTH COUNTY MEETING. Seldom, if ever, have we had greater pleasure or more perfect satisfaction in attending any anti-slavery meeting, than we enjoyed at the semi-annual meeting of the Plymouth Co. Society, held in Duxbury, on Tuesday, 22d ultimo. A fairer day was never seen, and every thing conspired to make the occasion full of interest and delight. Vehicles came rolling in from all parts of the county, crowded with delegates of the best stamp, whose deeds are their praises, and to whom the cause of human rights is dearer than life. For a sample of the spirit which pervaded the meeting, see the proceedings which are placed on our first page. On the question of the old and new organization, there was not a dissenting voice!Truly, the abolitionism of old Plymouth is founded upon a rock. It will be seen that this Society bore a strong testimony against the formation of a third political party. The vote was unanimous. The entertainment which was provided for the delegates, by the Duxbury Female Society, was got up in excellent style, and very gratefully appreciated by those who participated in it nearly two hundred. In the evening, we addressed a crowded assembly in the Methodist meeting-house. The venerable Seth Sprague, whose age and strength seem to be renewed, presided on the occasion. he is a senatorial candidate, and deserves to receive (as we doubt not he will) the undivided support of the abolitionists of that County.       

       BRO. GARRISON:While we are endeavoring to secure justice for the slave, we ought, I think, to be careful not to do injustice to one another. A correspondent of yours, who has furnished a brief account of the late meeting of the Bristol County Anti-Slavery Society, has done injustice to me, by incorrectly representing my statement of reasons for moving a dissolution of the Society. He has misrepresented me, in the first place, by omitting the principal reason I presented for my motion, and in the second place by stating what I never said. I assigned as a reason for moving a dissolution of the society, that at or near the close of the last meeting of the society, which was held at New Bedford last spring, a motion was made (by a gentleman, whose sympathies were decidedly with you in the matters of dispute,) that the society be dissolved after the $10,000 pledge to the American Society should be paid by the Massachusetts society, presenting as a reason for his motion the difficulties which were then arising among the friends of the slave, and which he saw were dividing us. I opposed his motion, because I had hopes that the difficulties, as they were then in their incipient stage, might be amicably adjusted. His motion was not adopted. But as I had been disappointed in my hopes of a settlement, and the breach had grown wider and wider, and all hope gone of its being repaired, I had become a convert to your friends doctrines, that it was best to dissolve, I therefore made a motion to that effect. Contrary, however, to what I had reason to expect, the party, who had before favored the dissolution, now opposed it, and my motion shared the fate described by your correspondent. All this matter, which was the substance of my reason for moving a dissolution of the society, your correspondent has omitted in his statement. He has not only made this important omission, but he has furthermore, represented me as saying what I never said. He says I gave as a reason for my motion, 'that they were not now free! that they were bound by a constitution.' In reference to a remark made by one of the agents, I believe Squire Ryder, that he was free, I observed that we were not free, and wished to be free, meaning that we were oppressed by the movements of the opposite party. I made no reference to the constitution, nor had I the constitution in view. That part of the statement, attributed to me, therefore, which relates to the constitution, I never made. Look at other statements of your correspondent. He says, 'the friends of the new organization, too, flocked to this meeting.' 'Ten or twelve,' he says, 'were present.' And again, he says, 'a new County Abolition Society, with five members, was 'organized.' Flocked, ten or twelve, and formed a society of five. The truth is, that of those who a year ago met at Assonett, and organized the Bristol County Anti-Slavery Society, there were twelve found at this meeting, and of that twelve, seven joined the new County Society, together with others (the number, I do not know.) who were not present at the organization of the old Society. The old Society is one year old. We entertain not a doubt, that a majority of the abolitionists in Bristol County are in favor of the new organization, and if we had had four agents in the county for several weeks before the meeting, drumming for recruits, a respectable number might have had zeal enough to face a northeaster, and been present; but probably not 100 from one town. Please insert this, and oblige,    free, flocked 'Ten twelve,' five Flocked, ten or twelve, five.    A friend of the slave,P. CRANDALL.      

 It appears from the following notice, that the promoters of division and discord in Worcester County are to hold a Convention at Westminster on the 20th inst.TO THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE IN WORCESTER, NORTH DIVISION. Dear brethren and friends: A large number of anti-slavery friends held a meeting at West Boylston on the 3d instant. The feeling was there unanimously expressed that the present crisis in the anti-slavery cause in this county, renders a new organization highly important.1st. The welfare of the perishing slave demands it.2d. That more efficient efforts may be put forth in his behalf a committee appointed by the meeting for that purpose would cordially invite those in favor of such an organization and those who are hesitating, to meet at Westminster, on the 3d Wednesday, (20) of November, at 10 o'clock A.M. to hear the report of this committee, and to form a society.            Yours for the slave,   Maynard King, George Waters, Abel Brown, Jr. Gilman Jones, George Goodyear, Enoch Whitmore, Committee.  Committee.   

          WORCESTER, Oct. 26, 1839.   WM. L. GARRISON,DEAR SIR, Allow me to reply, in a few words, to certain remarks in your paper, respecting my 'sayings and doings.' While Mr. 'James Davenport' remained merely an anonymous slanderer, it could not be expected that any man, who sought to retain his own self-respect, would notice him. And now, while I make a few remarks upon his communication, I must add, that if he was as well known to your readers, generally as he is in Boylston, and vicinity, I should not take the trouble to say a single word respecting his communications. I remark,(1) That his report of my remarks, at West Boylston, (in your paper of Sept. 22) was not correct, in a single particular, worthy of notice. When he reported any fact stated by me, it was given out of its connection, and with additions, and emendations, so that the whole sense and meaning of the statement, as I made it, were destroyed. And further remarks made by others, and by himself even, are presented to your readers as mine.(2) The report of my remarks at Boylston, is more nearly correct yet out of 21 particulars contained in it, not more than 8 or 9, are entirely so. That which purports to give my expressed views of the 'women question' you, and hundreds of your readers, know cannot be true. The reference to the effects of female effort in England, was that, in all the history of British emancipation, the example of woman's speaking or voting in anti-slavery meetings did not occur their influence was that of social life, and activity in those modes of effort, about which we do not differ. This statement I made, on the authority of JOHN SCOBLE, given in the presence of many witnesses, on board the steamboat, on our way to the Albany Convention. Whether I 'reviled' any one, or 'raved' or made 'malicious misrepresentations,' I would willingly submit to the assembly of intelligent people who listened to me. It could never be decided by a recurrence to Mr. D's report of what I said. That he took counsel of his own strong prejudices and warm passions, in preparing it, those of your readers who heard his coarse attack upon me, at West Boylston, when he knew not my name even, will readily believe.(3) I will not take up space in your columns, by any farther correction of Mr. D's misstatements and I wish to advertise you and your readers, that, whatever statements, true or untrue, you may think proper to admit into your columns in regard to me, they will hereafter pass without notice, in this form from me. If they are in any case true, let them stand. When they pass uncontradicted, it will not be because of their truth, but because I cannot stop pleading for the slave, to come down into the arcua of personal controversy. After the slaves are all freed, it will be time enough to clear myself of the imputations of 'falsehoods,' etc. with which your columns are occasionally sprinkled. If you think the cause of human rights is or can be promoted by such assaults upon myself, or others, make them, and suffer your correspondents, to make them in your paper, just as often as you will. We shall all, before long, stand before a higher tribunal than public opinion. And while I retain my present views of the utter wickedness of 'self-defence by physical force,' and 'lawsuits in defence of personal character,' such assaults may pass, with perfect impunity, till we meet in the presence of the 'Great God, and our Savior, Jesus Christ.'      West Boylston, out of its connection, others,   more nearly social life,   After the slaves are all freed, make them,    Yours with regard,CHAS. T. TORREY.      

       A Convention of Ministers and Laymen of the Baptist denomination in this Commonwealth, the object of which is the purification of that denomination 'from the reproach of cherishing in its bosom the sin of slavery,' will be held in Worcester on Thursday next, Nov. 7. The call is headed by Joshua T. Everett, of Princeton, and signed by upwards of fifty individuals. We trust our Baptist brethren will make this convention memorable in the history of Massachusetts.    

       An agent of the Massachusetts Abolition Society came here a few weeks since to collect money. Obtained the names of all who contributed to the anti-slavery cause last year with the names affixed, which they then paid. Then called on them, and asked them to subscribe to the cause as much this year, not in all cases letting them know that he was an agent of the new society, and that he wanted their money to sustain the cause of dissension. Thus he beguiled some of the people, and made them think their money would go as it did last year to the Anti-Slavery Society. A cause that must be sustained by such arts cannot be blessed of Heaven. It hates the light, and will not come to the light lest its deeds should be made manifest.To obtain patronage for the Abolition Society, the agent assured J.H. that Garrison was a 'right down rascal,' and that 'H.C. Wright was worse.' J.H. requested him to state some facts on which he based such a heavy charge. He said that Garrison, when asked about the woman question, replied by asking 'If you were a slave and were emancipated, would you stop to ascertain whether you were redeemed through the instrumentality of man or woman, before you accepted the boon of freedom?' To show that Wright was worse than a 'right down rascal,' he said that he lectured in the churches of Unitarians, Universalists, Methodists, Baptists, Orthodox, and Heterodox, without distinction that he shook hands with all, and put up with all alike without regard to the sect or party to which they belong, thus trampling down all denominations and distinctions. He said Wright spoke against the clergy. This made him worse than a 'down right rascal,' and was worse than to assert that it matters not whether the slave is redeemed through the instrumentality of men or women.Is it then become a crime that makes a man worse than a 'down right rascal' in the view of Phelps, E. Wright, and others, supporters of the Massachusetts Abolition Society, for a man to stand on the platform of MAN'S humanity, to regard MAN AS MAN without regard to color, sex, creed or party? Do they authorize their agents to assail men with abuse, because, in pleading the cause of life and liberty, they pay no regard to sectarian and party lines?Salem, Oct. 23.   Anti-Slavery   rascal,'  man woman, men women.        H.C.W.     

 GRINDING TO POWDER. John Pierpont, the gifted and independent pastor of Hollis street church, has just replied (in a pamphlet occupying more than fifty pages) to the charges brought against him by a committee of his congregation; and happy and powerful as he usually is with his pen, he has never used it with greater effect than on this occasion. Never were opponents placed in a more ludicrous or humiliating position. They are not only broken in fragments, our ground to powder. We shall publish this masterly reply entire in our next number.     

          ABINGTON, Oct. 21st, 1839.   FRIEND GARRISON:At a meeting of the Abington A.S. Society, held this evening, at the 4th Congregational meeting-house in this town, N.H. Whiting gave a most eloquent and impressive lecture, after which, the following resolutions were adopted.Whereas, there appears to be a wide-spread disposition manifested by some professed abolitionists, to destroy the present organization of the Massachusetts A.S. Society, and a persevering determination to throw overboard the old weather-beaton officers, who have so manfully withstood the furious storms, and navigated the ship with untiring zeal and superior skill; and as the cause which has led to these hard-strained and hypocritical efforts of time-serving priests and aspiring demagogues, are neither more nor less than a fear that the people should know the whole truth, (which will make them free) and an insatiable thirst for power, to bring into bondage the freeborn soul therefore,Resolved, That we still continue to stick by the old ship; believing her intrepid officers every way qualified to manage and bring her safely into port.Resolved, That it is our most imperious duty to maintain FREE discussion on all decorous subjects; knowing that as it brings mind in contact with mind, (thereby eradicating false principles, and bringing to light new and important truths,) it will prove the most powerful and efficacious course in breaking the chains both moral and physical.Resolved, That we will stand fast in that liberty with which Christ has made us free; and as we embrace men and women, of all sects and parties, we cannot recognize the right to bind their consciences, in any way whatever.Resolved, That while we hail with delight the establishment of any periodical devoted to the cause of the oppressed, as a harbinger of that jubilee when the slave shall go free, we view with the deepest regret the unjustifiable and treacherous means resorted to in imposing upon the public a paper, carrying in its columns the seeds of disunion, and using its highest efforts to demolish the first GARRISON erected for the defence of EQUAL RIGHTS.Voted, That a copy of the above resolutions be forwarded for insertion in the Liberator and Cradle of Liberty.                   SAMUEL DYER, Sec'ry. pro tem. Sec'ry. pro tem.     

 BLOWING HOT AND COLD. The facility with which the editor of the Abolitionist can blow hot and cold, and especially eat his own words, is quite remarkable. In his paper, of yesterday, he attempts to refute the reasoning of the Political Address, recently issued by the Board of Managers of the State A.S. Society; but the attempt is a failure. Not until he stands once more upon the old anti-slavery platform will be he able to feel, speak or see correctly.     

       As this society has in former times occupied some space in the attention of the anti-slavery public, it seems desirable that its present singular position should be fairly brought before that public at this time. It will be my aim to give a faithful and accurate account of the proceedings of the two sessions of the annual meeting held within the last fortnight; and as I am aware of the character of the behaviour that I shall attempt to chronicle, it will be my special care that the truth of the account shall be unimpeachable.The regular time for the annual meeting, occurred on the second Wednesday of October. A large number of women assembled, and after the usual devotional services, the Annual Report was read and accepted. There was in it no allusion relative to the present aspect of the anti-slavery cause; and the society which in former years established the right of slaves brought into the state, to their freedom, recorded as one of their most important efforts the transmission of a box of fancy articles to the Hon. Mr. Elmore! By the Treasurer's Report it appeared that the proceeds of the society were less by about $300 than in 1837, a natural result of the division introduced into the society by the Clerical Appeal, which division has been increasing up to the present time. After some correspondence relative to the British India Society had been submitted, the election of officers came on, Miss Parker presiding. Mrs. Child nominated Mrs. Southwick for President, and immediately some one nominated Miss Mary S. Parker. Mrs. Child said, that in the present state of the Society, we needed to have an impartial President. She would say, in all kindness and courtesy to Miss Parker, that this was not the case at present. She had been pained at the last meeting by the great want of impartiality with which the duties of the chair had been discharged.Miss Anne Weston said, that though coinciding with Mrs. Child in her view of the manner in which the President had presided at a former meeting, yet her reasons for being warmly opposed to Miss Parker's re-election were more important and weighty. They were reasons that applied to a majority of the last Board, namely, the fact that through its Board, this Society was placed in the attitude of sympathizing with and indirectly countenancing the new organization, and laboring to injure, as far as might be in its power, the Massachusetts A.S. Society. Believing the latter Society to be the best existing instrumentality that the anti-slavery cause possessed, she earnestly hoped that all who were true abolitionists, and desired to promote the best interests of the slave, would vote against Miss Parker's election.Miss Lucy Ball appealed to the Society to sustain Miss Parker on the ground of her former services. With regard to the new organization, she asked, 'Have we not the right to sympathize with it?'Miss Parker said she knew partiality to be her chief failing, and she was obliged to Mrs. Child for pointing it out, though she must say Mrs. Child could hardly have been more personal. Different charges, she remarked, had been brought against her by different individuals, one accusing her of partiality, and another wishing to proscribe her for opinion's sake.Miss Weston explained that there might easily be a difference in the reasons of the opposition of different persons; that of course, Miss Parker was at liberty to entertain what views she pleased, and the Society were equally at liberty to declare she was not the representative of the views of the Society. There was no proscription in this. Neither did she undervalue Miss Parker's former services. The question was not, whether she was equal to the crisis of 1835, but to the still more dangerous one of 1839. To this it appeared she was wholly inadequate.Mrs. Chapman said, that in this matter she knew nothing of persons; she wished to know no Miss Parker, no Mrs. Southwick, she wished to know no Society, but she wished we might go for principles. She repeated that she wished to know nothing of persons. Here Miss Lucy Ball exclaimed 'Yes, you do, Mrs. Chapman, know persons; you think nobody is an abolitionist who does not think just as you do. You told us the other evening you did not consider us abolitionists.' Mrs. Child thought Miss Ball out of order. Miss Sullivan asked her to address the Chair. The question on the nomination of Mrs. Southwick was put and lost. The question on the election of Miss Parker was taken by rising, Miss Sullivan stating the vote to be 77 in the affirmative, and 35 in the negative. The vote was doubted, a number of ladies declaring they had counted the votes in the negative, and that they were 42, without reference to a number of persons who were standing near the door, and whom it was impossible to count without appointing tellers. Miss Sullivan counted again, then declared the vote to stand 38 in the negative. If the vote had been declared higher, Miss Parker's election would have been lost for want of the constitutional majority. Upon one of the members remarking that, of course, none but members of the Society had voted, several ladies admitted that they had voted, though not members, it is to be presumed under come misapprehension; for on its being stated that none but members were to vote, a number of ladies left the hall. Miss Weston moved that the vote be taken again by yeas and nays, which were refused on the ground of want of time, but it was universally conceded that these must be taken before the vote could be ascertained. At no time was Miss Parker declared elected. A motion for adjournment was put, and as far as could be ascertained by a rising vote, was not carried; the Vice President stated it to be lost. Miss Lucy Ball, who was standing by the door, opened it, exclaiming 'The meeting is adjourned. Ladies, go home go home.' The Vice President said she had made a mistake she had intended to say the motion was carried. The vote was doubted from all parts of the hall Miss Ball said it would not be right to take the vote again, as numbers of ladies had gone away, thinking the meeting adjourned. After a scene of confusion in the attempt to ascertain whether the meeting was adjourned or not, it finally separated. When the vote was put, nothing was said as to the time to which the meeting stood adjourned, but through the papers, the Secretary notified the annual meeting to stand adjourned to the afternoon of Wednesday, Oct. 23d.At the time specified, the large hall under the Chapel was filled with women, many being present who were not members of the Society. After the customary devotional services, Miss Parker stated, that as Miss Gould, the Recording Secretary, was absent, it would be necessary to choose a Secretary pro tem. Miss Lucy Ball was chosen.The minutes of the last meeting were read, in them the statement being made that Miss Parker had been elected! At the previous meeting, the fact that she was elected was never stated. At this stage in the business, Mrs. Chapman remarked upon the great impropriety of Miss Parker's presiding over her own election, and said as this was a matter in which the whole Board was concerned, she would prefer that some disinterested person should take the chair for the afternoon. Miss Parker said she should preside over the meeting herself. She had consulted members of the Common Council, and members of the Legislature, she had examined parliamentary manuals, and all agreed that one Board was in office till another had been elected; therefore, added she, I shall preside this afternoon. Mrs. Chapman, said, she would make no dispute on so tritling a point, though she disapproved of it. Miss Parker, the acceptance of the minutes having been previously moved, stated the question to be on their acceptance.Miss Anna Weston opposed their acceptance on the ground of their incorrectness. There was no election at the previous meeting. That was the very point we were met to decide. It could not be stated to be decided till after the yeas and nays were taken. She would ask Miss Parker, whether she considered herself elected.Miss Parker declined to answer, but stated that those who now voted for the acceptance of the minutes would be considered as voting for Miss Parker, and those who voted against them as voting against her.Mrs. Chapman wished that the two questions might be divided, as the subject of Miss Parker's election would then be more fairly before the meeting.Miss Parker declared any thing on this point out of order. Ladies must speak to the acceptance of the minutes. The absurdity of indirectly settling a contested election by taking a vote on the acceptance of the minutes, was exposed by Miss Collier, who said she wished to vote for Miss Parker, but could not vote on the correctness of the minutes, not having been present at the preceding meeting.Miss Lucy Ball repeated, in effect, her remarks at the previous meeting relative to Miss Parker. She also remarked, it was very difficult for a presiding officer to preserve impartiality, as was evident from the conduct of Mr. Francis Jackson, who was repeatedly called to order* by the meeting, for partiality at the last annual meeting of the Mass. A.S. Society, but she never heard that for this the minority attempted to prevent his re-election. She farther remarked that some of the members who were opposing Miss Parker's election were opposed to the formation of a Female Anti-Slavery Society, and above all, were unwilling at its commencement that colored people should join the Society, because it would make the anti-slavery cause unpopular; at least, this was the case with one most opposed to Miss Parker's election. She hoped the colored friends would notice this.Miss Weston replied to Miss Ball. She explained afresh her reasons for voting in the negative, shewed wherein the minutes were incorrect, and stated that the behaviour of the Board at the present crisis, with regard to the contest now agitating the state, would be her reason for opposing their election. The Society was already quoted by Charles T. Torrey, an agent of the new organization, as in sympathy with them, and the society was looked upon with deep regret by the real friends of the slave, both in and out of the State. She also wished to allude to the charge brought by Miss Ball against a lady present. She call-for the name. She felt it a duty to all who were acting against Miss Parker's election, as well as to the lady concerned, to rebut the calumny. To do this was but a simple act of justice to the person thus slandered.Miss Parker called Miss Weston to order, saying she should permit no personalities. Some one remarked that the proper time to call to order was when a charge was made against an individual, not when it was being denied.Miss Weston said, that when a charge was made against an individual involving so seriously her character for abolition integrity, it was but simple justice to allow the truth to be heard. In justice to Mrs. Child she wished to answer the statement Miss Ball had made.Mrs. Child rose to express the hope that no one would defend her abolition character. If it could not stand without defence, it might fall. She should content herself with a simple denial of the statement as to the admittance of colored people. That she had considered the formation of a distinct female society inexpedient, was correct.Miss Lucinda Otis addressed the meeting at some length, from the platform to which she was invited, in support of Miss Parker. She thought that as a society, we should be perfectly non-committal, so far as the new organization and the Mass. Anti-Slavery Society were concerned. We had nothing to do with either. She hoped we should not put ourselves under clerical tutors and directors, or any other tutors. She hoped we all loved Garrison; she saw no reason for disagreement.Miss Anne Weston replied to Miss Otis, saying that she considered the attitude, proposed by that lady for the society to assume, a most wrong and degrading one: one faithless to the best interests of the slave. Was the Boston F.A.S. Society, which had hitherto gone forward into the heat of the conflict, was that society now to retreat? and when a conflict most vital to the interests of the A.S. cause was raging, would the Boston F.A.S. Society be neutral? If the Board had gone no farther than to be in sentiment with the view just expressed, she should think them unfit to take the direction of this Society.Miss Sullivan expressed the opinion that neutrality was the course for the society to pursue. Mrs. Shipley and Mrs. Low spoke in behalf of the acceptance of the minutes, though the latter lady said she wished to show no countenance to the new organization. She could not see how any woman could sanction, for a moment, a society which would put a plaster on her mouth, tie her feet, and leave her hands to be used as cat's-paws.The yeas and nays were then called on the acceptance of the minutes. Miss Ball, as the Secretary pro tem. kept the account, and for a short time did so fairly. But as numbers of women whose names were omitted, rose to ask that their names should be called, difficulties were raised. At every name which Miss Ball was not sure was favorable to Miss Parker's election, except where the member had been for years extremely prominent, the question was put 'How long have you been a member of the Society?' and even when the answer was (as was generally the case) 'several years,' the lady would be called on to rise, and after a little more scrutiny, dismissed by a cool 'very well.' We give one instance as a specimen of many others. Miss Caroline Williams asked that her name might be called. Miss Ball 'Are you a member?' Miss Williams 'Yes.' Miss Ball 'Is your name on the Secretary's books?' Miss Williams 'I don't know; I am a member.' Miss Ball 'How long have you been a member?' Miss Williams 'Several years.' The Secretary turned over the records slowly, and after a few minutes called another name. Miss Williams again rose 'Is my vote not to be allowed me?' Miss Ball 'Your name has been called.' Several ladies said that Miss Williams had not voted. The records were again examined, no decision made as to Miss Williams's vote, and the Secretary passed on to other names. After four more similar attempts on the part of Miss Williams and her friends to secure her vote, the Secretary proceeded to call her name. Another fact will illustrate the manner in which the business was conducted. A number of months since, a lady left with Mrs. Chapman her name to be affixed to the Constitution of the Society, and her assessment (50 cents) thinking Mrs. C. to be one of the officers. Mrs. Chapman had forgotten to do this, but when the lady came to the meeting, expecting of course to have her privileges as a member allowed, Mrs. Chapman, before the meeting was called to order, went to the President, explained the circumstances of the case, and requested the lady's name to be duly entered. The lady corroborated the statement. Afterwards, when she asked that her name should be called, Miss Parker stated with great warmth that no name that was not on the Secretary's books would be called. Mrs. Chapman explained the circumstance to the meeting, and apologized for her neglect. Miss Soley, the lady in question, inquired if she could vote. Miss Parker, with still greater violence, reiterated the assertion, 'No name not on the Secretary's books will be read.' Mrs. Chapman 'The Secretary will please read the name from the paper on the table before her.' Miss Parker 'Sit down, sit down, take your seat, Mrs. Chapman. No name that has been given in to the Secretary to-day will be read.'The yeas and nays having been called, Miss Ball announced the vote as 150 in the affirmative and 65 in the negative. Miss Caroline Weston stated that she had kept account accurately, and the vote stood 138 in the affirmative and 82 in the negative. Another lady in the opposite part of the room, Miss D. Weston, said that her account coincided with her sister's, and that she had counted neither yea or nay that had not been repeated after the lady voting, by the Secretary herself. Mrs. Merriam made the vote a little less on both sides, namely, 130 to 77, the difference being occasioned by her not commending her count till after a few names had been called. Miss Ford of Hyannis also kept an account, and obtained a precisely corresponding result with Miss Weston's. All these four counts were by persons acting independently of one another. A member remarked, that with the vote as stated by the Secretary, there would not be a constitutional majority in the affirmative, (a mistake) upon which the Secretary altered her announcement of the affirmative vote from 150 to 158! A number of members attempted to speak, and calls for the vote to be fairly taken were uttered from all parts of the room. Mrs. Southwick in a firm tone said 'I protest against this whole proceeding, and move that Miss Parker leave the chair, and Miss Sullivan take it, that the business of this meeting may be properly transacted.' Mrs. Southwick was heard, though all the time she was speaking. Miss Parker uttered incessant cries of 'there is no motion before the house. Sit down, take your seat, Mrs. Southwick. You shall sit down.' After Mrs. Southwick had so far succeeded in attracting Miss Parker's notice as to make her comprehend that she was submitting as a motion, that Miss Sullivan should be called to the chair, in the same hurried manner that characterized all she did during the latter portion of the afternoon, Miss Parker submitted the motion, declaring almost at the same instant, 'It is not a vote.' She then said 'Miss Mary Parker is elected President: I say Miss Mary Parker is elected President.'Miss Caroline Weston doubted the vote on the acceptance of the minutes, which doubt was sustained by ladies from all parts of the hall. Miss Weston then requested that the names might be read, according to custom, that the vote might be ascertained. This was refused, Miss Parker deciding that she had nothing to do with accounts kept by different members! She should abide by the Secretary's checked list? yet refusing to read it over! Miss Parker requested the meeting to nominate a Vice President. Miss Weston said she thought we were yet without a President, as it might well be doubted whether an election could be properly made to turn upon the minutes. Several persons were nominated. Miss Parker said Miss Sullivan was nominated for Vice President. The vote was taken by rising, and Miss Parker declared it to be carried. The vote was doubted, and though a number of ladies had left the house; and though the members seemed nearly equally divided, no counting was permitted. One lady said to Miss Parker, 'I doubt the vote.' 'Take your seat,' said she. 'But I doubt the vote.' 'Then you may doubt it to the day of your death,' was Miss Parker's rejoinder. Miss Deborah Weston, on Miss Sullivan's nomination, moved for the yeas and nays, and her motion was disregarded by the chair, who decided it to be out of order for any person to call for the yeas and nays, except those who had previously voted in the affirmative on the question! The very singular circumstances under which Miss Parker was presiding, can alone account for this very extraordinary decision. The pretended election of the other officers was carried on in an equally unconstitutional manner. The yeas and nays were denied to ladies, who, after the singular ruling of the presiding officer, voted in the affirmative for the purpose of calling for them. They were questioned by the Chair whether they had voted in the affirmative, for the purpose of enabling them to move the yeas and nays; on this question being answered in the affirmative, the motion was denied, on the ground that it was contrary to usage. To this it was replied, that as we had once this afternoon taken them under the same circumstances, it was not contrary to usage. The answer was, 'You are out of order; take your seat.' In many cases the negative was not called for, all debate on the nominations was pronounced out of order, and though every vote was declared doubted, no notice was taken of the doubt. After the officers were declared elected, and while a member had possession of the floor, an adjournment was moved, and declared by Miss Parker to be carried.What should be the course of faithful members of the Society at this time? The principles of the Society are inviolate. While they continue so, let us seek to save it from destruction. The ground on which we stand is holy. Let us not leave it, but contend for it, till falsehood and duplicity are fully exposed.              lost.

 COLONIZATION Elliot Cresson, it is said, tells the following story to represent, the consistency of Colonization:'Colonization is like the nobleman's dog, who by some accident was cut in two; an individual present, having a sovereign remedy for such wounds, in his haste to restore the dog, put him together with two legs up and two down; so the dog, when he became tired of travelling with one side, would take the other.'This is well said, Elliot. Colonization, is like a crab, it goes either of two ways. At the South it goes in favor of slavery; at the North it pretends to go against it. Emancipator.   consistency     Emancipator.   

         Mrs. A. Is it possible, my dear Harriet, that what I have heard is true, and that you have actually joined the Anti-Slavery Society?Harriet. It is so, aunt; I became satisfied that it was my duty.Mrs. A. I thought your mother did not approve of your engaging in this matter.Harriet. She did not, but then she wished me to act according to my own sense of right; she says I am of an age to decide for myself upon questions of right and wrong.Mrs. A. I am sorry that my sister has been so weakly indulgent to you; I doubt not that in a short time I shall hear that she also has turned abolitionist, and if your uncle does not prevent his name from being so disgraced, she will sign the petitions to Congress with other misguided women.Harriet. Excuse me, dear aunt, but I cannot help hoping that your fears may be realized. But why is it that you are displeased with what I have done? I thought you told me that you were convinced that slavery is sinful; and you have often said that you felt as much for the poor slaves as I do.Mrs. A. And I dare say I do; but I do not approve of the doings of the abolitionists in the first place; and most of all do I disapprove of women's meddling with such things.Harriet. Why so?Mrs. A. It is evident, my dear, that men are appointed by Providence to make and administer the laws; it is a violation of the Divine Order when women interfere in politics. Slavery is the law of the land it is a political question and therefore there is a great impropriety in women's meddling with the subject.Harriet. Waiving the question altogether of the propriety of women having any thing to do with politics, is not the subject of slavery in fact a religious and moral question? Its pernicious effects extend to the remotest parts of our country; its poison has entered into every fibre and muscle, if I may so speak, of our otherwise happy land; not a living soul but directly or indirectly feels its baneful influence, whether they know and confess it, or not.Mrs. A. Suppose, Harriet, that this extravagant statement of yours were correct still, what can women do about it? What, for instance, can an ignorant girl like you do? Mr. A., who has studied the subject faithfully, says that he thinks nothing can be done, especially by northerners, and most especially by women. Doubtless, in the course of Providence, slavery, like many other evils that have passed away, will die out; but what, Harriet, can all these silly women do about it?Harriet. Much, I think, may be done, even by foolish women, to take the worst aspect of the case, though I do not confess to their folly.Mrs. A. Well, Harriet, that is a specimen of your love of opposition. What good can a foolish woman do for any cause?Harriet. Why, dear aunt, I have more faith in the intrinsic strength of a good principle than of an evil one; and as I see so many foolish men supporting slavery, which is all evil, by their opinions and practice, I do not see why foolish women, with the strength and the enlightening power of truth on their side, may not do something to overthrow it. But there are some women of good sense and powerful talents in the anti-slavery ranks. I need not name them.Mrs. A. These are the very women that I blame; they not only depart from the plain path of duty pointed out by Providence themselves, but they mislead others.Harriet. I cannot think that when we all stand before the bar of Divine Justice, any woman will be condemned for having labored to abolish the greatest and most far-spreading system of wickedness that is to be found in the whole history of man. I find in the New Testament no limits but possibility to the duties of any human being; it seems to me that we are all bound to do 'what we can.'Mrs. A. But suppose, for argument's sake, I grant this. What can women do? nothing, absolutely nothing; they are, most of then, ignorant and impotent.Harriet. Let them inform themselves in the first place, and that source of weakness will cease; let them study the laws, the history of slavery in their native land; let them know what it really is.Mrs. A. No woman of a nice sensibility, or of a truly refined delicacy, can bear to read the annals of slavery. I just opened Paxton's letters, and it made me sick for the whole day; it is just so with 'Slavery as it is.' by Mr. and Mrs. Weld; I took it up in your parlor the other day, and I could not bear to read two pages of it, it made me so unhappy.Harriet. And yet that book is made up of well authenticated facts, many of them from slaveholders themselves; and what must the poor beings have to endure, whose misery is so great we cannot even bear to read of it?Mrs. A. But, my dear Harriet, what is the use of my making myself so unhappy about them? Of what use are my tears and sighs to the poor creatures?Harriet. I cannot allow, aunt, that this is all you can do for them, but suppose it were. Put yourself in the place of the oppressed, broken-hearted slave-mother, who, perhaps, has just seen her child sold, to go she knows not whither; would it not be some comfort to her, even if you could not help her, to know that there was one human heart that ached for her sorrows, and that would help her if it could? Are we not bound to give them our tears, our pity, if we can give no more; may not our prayers meet and unite with theirs in fervent supplication to the Father of mercies that he would set them free? But we can, O I am sure we can, every woman can, do much.Mrs. A. I fear not. Your uncle says you only do harm by all these petitions, for instance.Harriet. We think otherwise, and while we do, we must still send uppetitions; if Congress takes the part of the unjust judge, we must imitate that of the importunate widow; but there are other and perhaps more effectual means in the hands of women.Mrs. A. What are they, Harriet; I hope it is not speaking in public?Harriet. I would have those who have the gift, and feel so impelled, speak any and every where for these unhappy beings who are cut off from human sympathy. Men will not speak for them; they cannot speak for themselves; shall not the women, even the very children speak for them, if they can? Oh that God in his wisdom and mercy might inspire them so that the prophet's words might be verified 'Their sons and their daughters shall prophesy.' But there is yet another way in which women at the North, and all women who consider slavery sinful, can do something for its abolition.Mrs. A. And what is that, Harriet?Harriet. By as far as possible washing their own hands and cleansing their own garments from its foul stain; for all in this land partake of its sin and are born under its condemnation.Mrs. A. Mercy, Harriet! you speak now like one of the disciples of Garrison; what do you mean? How am I, for instance, under this condemnation? how are my garments or hands stained with the sin of slavery?Harriet. You live under its laws; you are enriched by its iniquitous gains; your father, husband and sons pay for its support; and what is more horrible than all, they may be obliged, either personally or by proxy, to commit murder to maintain it. The law commands you to give up a fugitive slave, let his master be ever so cruel a tyrant; the slaveholders have an influence in Congress proportioned to the number of their slaves, and then make laws for the free states. The riches of the South are the result of the sighs and groans and bleeding stripes and blistering tears of almost three millions of slaves; and do not northerners share constantly in these riches? What was the original cause of the war in Florida? Slavery. The fugitive slaves found friends and formed connections among the persecuted Indians, and the southerners demanded them and their children as property, and the Indians defended these, men and women as they thought them, in their natural rights, against the christian republicans. This war has already cost the nation more than twenty millions of dollars, and every man in the free states has to pay his tax for it. Should the slaves ever dare to imitate our forefathers simply in the vindication of their claims to humanity, your sons may be called upon to go and help murder them for it. This statement, dear aunt, I believe no one contradicts. Does not slavery, then, touch us all every one of us? Have not northern mothers and wives and sisters something to do with slavery?Mrs. A. It makes me perfectly nervous to hear you talk so, Harriet, and what is the use of it? I again ask, what can women do to abolish slavery, even if it were safe to do it, though your uncle says it is not?Harriet. They can do much: they can petition Congress against its continuance in the District of Columbia and the Territories; they can protest against it every where and upon all fitting occasions; they can teach their sons and daughters, as soon as they can understand them, how sinful it is; they can urge upon them the duty of making every effort for its abolition. Northern women can refuse to marry slaveholders; northern mothers can ask their consciences whether they could stand before God guiltless if they had acquiesced in the marriage of their daughters with slaveholders.Mrs. A. But, my dear Harriet, some slaveholders are very good men: and suppose two young people were strongly attached to each other, must a girl in such a case refuse to marry a man she really loves?Harriet. I think so; if she views slavery as it really is, she could never become a slaveholder herself, as she would by such a union. Neither do I think a christian woman would long continue to love a man who could keep slaves after he knew how great a sin it was.Mrs. A. Perhaps he cannot be convinced it is a sin; perhaps he thinks it right, and the best thing for the slaves.Harriet. It is her duty to try to convince him in every way in her power, and if she fail in this, to give him the strongest testimony she can of the strength of her own conviction, by resigning her love for him for what ought to be always her highest love, a love of right, a love of justice, love of humanity.Mrs. A. But, if she were to marry him, she might perhaps convert him to her own views, and so she would be the means of redeeming his slaves from bondage.Harriet. I could not for one day for one hour, eat bread earned for me by slaves. I should feel degraded in my own eyes; the poor negro by whose forced and unrequited labor I am supported would be a higher being than myself in my own estimation; I should be the true slave. But I cannot imagine myself as loving a man who was defrauding human beings of their most precious possession every moment of his life; to be his wife would be to live under the most odious, the most abjact of all bondage, that of my moral nature.Mrs. A. Oh Harriet! to accuse slaveholders of fraud is not fair. You know that most of the present southern slaveholders have inherited their slaves, or they have purchased those who are already in bondage, and have been inherited by their ownersHarriet. There is no time, no circumstances, no changing of hands, that can ever justify theft or fraud; a slave is a man defrauded of his natural, his dearest, his inalienable rights; and whoever holds him as such stands convicted of being in fact accessory to an act of the most daring and cruel robbery.Mrs. A. Then, Harriet, you will not marry the rich Mr.-----, who is so much in love with you?Harriet, No, never, while by these hands I can minister to my necessities; better and happier would it be to be a beggar in the streets, a sordid dependant on a grudging charity, than with my views be the wife of a rich slaveholder.

 DIED In Stoneham, August 31, Mrs. Elizabeth T. Howard, wife of Joshua H. Howard, and eldest daughter of Mr. Henry Green, aged 20. The few last weeks of her life were seasons of peculiar trial, in which she manifested much patience and submission to the will of Heaven. Her attachment to the slaves, we believe, was sincere. She regarded them not only in word but in deed. To her friends, who deeply lament her loss, she has given good evidence that her hope was based on Him who is the resurrection and the life.     

       As the passenger casts his eye up the arch from Washington-street to the Marlboro' Chapel, he discerns symptoms of activity and festivity somewhat unusual. A cheerful crowd enliven the passage, and the motto 'FREEDOM AND TRUTH BY THESE WE CONQUER,' in letters a foot long, responds from the entablature above the entrance, to the feeling which animates every heart.Within the hall the decorations are characteristic of the occasion, as well as fraught with old historic associations. All has been done that could be done to make the long, low room as cheerful and pleasant as the loftier ones which the experience of past years has given the managers to know are not to be obtained for the service of Liberty. An interesting assemblage is gathered within: the anti-slavery women of Massachusetts, from all parts of their beloved Commonwealth, superintending the sale of the various articles of taste, ingenuity and utility, which they have for months been busied in preparing for this occasion. The representatives of each town are grouped together beneath banners inscribed with its name and ancient device and motto, 'quartered in old armorial sort,' in commemoration of the English descent of their respective founders. May those noble old English names ever 'be in the flowing heart freshly remembered!' Not only are they the names of our remote progenitors, but of those who have been renowned in song and story for their devotedness to Freedom. There is the Lion Rampant of the Russells waving over New Bedford, where still the name of Russell predominates. There is Plymouth, with its shield studded with crosses, and its noble motto, 'Je me fie en Dieu.' Weymouth, able to say now as did the counts of former days to whom the name pertained, 'fai bonne cause!' Lynn, with its scallop shells, and motto more than ever appropriate: 'Ennobled for our fidelity.' These, with numbers of others that have been borne aloft in Palestine and France in Scotland and in England in the battles of centuries that are past, have now become the insignia of our moral warfare with wrong and oppression.Never was there a finer display of money's worth, whether the purchaser be in search of the useful or the beautiful. The utilitarian and the aesthetic will find their claims equally remembered. For an enumeration of the articles on sale we refer to our advertising columns, particularly commending to notice our little annual, the LBIBERTY BELL, the motto alone of which is worth the price of the volume to the literateur. Our young friends are not forgotten. A table is expressly provided for them. They will find also a great attraction in witnessing the process of printing which is going on.How much labor has been expended how many sacrifices undergone to furnish this array for Freedom's sake! The aged mother has exerted her dim eye to furnish those little knitted articles which attract your attention. Her children begged her not to exhaust the sight and strength which her age could so ill afford; but she could not withhold them. 'It is for the anti-slavery cause;' and all, even the aged, must do somewhat, as they hope to depart in peace with the hope of so great a salvation.Here, too, are the avails of the juvenile sewing circle, as well of the labors of the matron of sixty years.The eye that has taken cognizance of the fashions of foreign climes, and the brain that has wrought into the intellectual treasures of past times, have alike been busy here. Here are relics precious to many, made from the wood of Pennsylvania Hall here are bouquets in silver vases. The latter are not for sale. They may well be more valuable to their owner than rubies, for they played their part in the struggle for religious liberty in Massachusetts in 1785. They were seized by the officers of the law, for the payment of church-rates. A trial was had: a righteous decision was obtained, owing to the eloquence of Rufus King, who pleaded the cause, and the integrity of the Judge who decided it with four other judges. From that time liberty of conscience has had the mastery in Massachusetts. These pieces of antique plate, with their coat of arms and their motto 'God helps the strong' are interesting memorials of a good man gone to his rest Epes Sargent: to whose firmness in testing this great question, his native state owes a debt of gratitude. Let the oppressive in spirit remember that 'all wickedness is weakness,' wherefore God helps only the strong in innocence and integrity. This coat was won, in times when might made right. It is now borne by those who deem right the only might.All the various rare and valuable articles here displayed, are commended to the benevolent and the just, and not to them only: we can conscientiously commend them to the self-love, as well as to the disinterestedness of visitors. They will do well to purchase for their own sakes, although we greatly wish that love of the cause of Freedom alone might be a sufficient inducement.    our New Bedford, Je me fie en Dieu.

       'Our liberties are in danger!' 'the last days of the Republic are at hand!' these are the portentous exclamations of the organs of either of the great political parties in our country, when the scales seem to incline to the opposite side, on the eve of an election. But these dark prophecies have been so often defeated, that they produce very little effect either on the actions or apprehensions of the experienced. They are received with the same degree of confident indifference, with which we listen to the predictions of the end of the world, brought forward from time to time by individuals who investigate some portions of the Bible in the same spirit in which the astrologers of former times studied the heavens.Both the distrust with which those in particular whose political ideas have been formed under different institutions, are apt to look upon the experiment of freedom in this country, and the confidence of those who have grown up under this new dispensation in politics, and whose hope has been strengthened by the failure of those dark prophecies both these opposite views have been honored by the name of patriotism. It is a question of considerable moment what it is that constitutes patriotism, especially American patriotism inasmuch as it involves the more important inquiry with regard to the real causes of public danger or security, which it is the duty of every true friend of this country to settle for himself, whether his [ ] incline him to hope or to fear.This country differs from every other that we are acquainted with, in this, that while the political organization of other nations derives its origin and it form from circumstances, the political existence of this Union is founded on a principle, a 'self-evident truth. It was the philosophic beginning of the Declaration of Independence being made the corner stone of a political edifice, which induced a foreign historian to introduce his account of the first entrance of these United States on the stage of Universal History, with the words, 'Novus saeclorum nascitur ordo,' a new era in the history of the world commences. The idea of universal justice which was to be realized in the American Union, enters indeed in some degree into the constitution of every country. The most arbitrary despot finds it necessary or expedient to declare that he will exercise his arbitrary power for the protection of the rights of his subjects. But while the Declaration of Independence recognizes the consent of the governed as the only rightful source, and the protection of their rights as the only legitimate object of all political power, the governments of other countries derive their right from their powers; and the protection of the right of their subjects is a duty for which they consider themselves responsible only to themselves.The constitution of every country must have a decided influence on the patriotism of the citizens [ ] generally on the manners, customs, literature, and [ ] institutions of the people. In a monarchy, devotion to its ruler is accounted patriotism; in a mixed government, this name is given to the strenuous support of the privileges of each of the different order; so that the clergy, the nobility, the commoners have each a patriotism in some measure peculiar to themselves, and not unfrequently at war with what other classes in society distinguish by the same name. The same is true with regard to different nations, whose practical acknowledgment of each other's rights is mainly determined by their relative powers and [ ]. Thus, until of late, a hearty hated of each other, was accounted an essential ingredient in the patriotism of the French and the English; a feeling which has entered extensively and deeply into the manners and the literature of both nations. The patriotism of every nation whose constitution is founded on power and circumstances, is from its nature exclusive. But in a country whose political organization rests on the principle of universal justice, on the inalienable equal rights of all men, genuine patriotism is nothing else than philanthropy beginning at home and extending all over the world. The permanence and prosperity of every nation that acknowledges power as the source of right, depends on the exclusive patriotism; the political existence of a country that recognizes right as the source of power, depends on the universal consistent philanthropy of its citizens.The preceding remarks may serve to fix the meaning of an expression that is known to exert a powerful, and according to its correct or improper use, a salutary or pernicious influence in society. They may help us, at any rate, to fix upon the true, standard of American patriotism. Every one who takes his stand on the declaration of the native equality, and the inalienable rights of all men, and strives to carry this principle of universal justice into effect, is a patriot, and every one who would deprive any human being of any one of their rights is not a patriot, but a stranger nay, an enemy to his country. He who would confer on any man or set of men any monopoly or prerogative on account of his wealth, or his family connexions, may pass for a patriot in countries where birth and wealth procure title and rank, but he is a stranger to his own, and has but one way left him in which he can effectually serve his native land, and that is by expatriating and planting himself in one of the title growing countries across the sea. And he who would withhold from any of his fellow men the rights of freemen on account of the color of their skin, he may find his proud claim to the name of a [ ] recognized in no country under heaven but in this . . .      a new era in the history of the world commences.

       A Quarterly meeting of the Lynn Anti-Slavery Society will be held at the Society's Room in Union St. THIS (FRIDAY) EVENING, at 7 o'clock.     WM. B. OLIVER, Sec'y.   Lynn, 11th mo. (Nov.) 1, 1839.    

          Fatherless and Widows Society.   This society, more than almost any other, claims our attention, not only because so many are needing our help, but because it seems peculiarly the work of God, who has told us that to visit the fatherless and the widow, is pure and undefiled religion. Of other objects of benevolence we may doubt the utility, and be unable to discern our duty; but in this we cannot mistake, and the heart that does not sympathize with the fatherless and widow, is not to be envied; that [ ] is scarcely worthy the name of christian. We [ ] that those who have not done any thing for this portion of sufferers, will consider it in this light, and give us now the means of doing more than we have ever done. Your Society has assisted the past year 479 widows, and 266 fatherless children a less number than the year previous, on account of want of funds.Says a Trustee of remarkable discernment and great experience in visiting these afflicted ones, after giving the number, age, &c., of the widows she has [ ] 'Nearly or quite all have had sickness in their families, or in their own persons, or both, during the season. In most cases their rooms are either smoky or leaky, or cold, or damp, and not unfrequently they combine all these qualities.They are all industrious, worthy women, willing to work beyond their strength. Nearly all depend on washing and ironing; but none of them can procure enough of this work to support their families in the winter, but they find no difficulty in summer, and never make application for aid during that season, nor is it believed at any other, when they can possibly help it. In general, they ask aid with reluctance, and [ ] it with gratitude.Some of them who have feeble health, can do nothing but slop-work; they cannot always procure enough of this to employ them constantly, and when they can, it is well known that the remuneration is just enough to starve on! We feel constrained every year to lift up our voice against this wretched system of extortion which bears down with crushing weight on the most helpless and afflicted of our poor, the [ ]. In this city there is but one class of individuals who cannot, extraordinaries excepted, obtain a comfortable living; and that is feeble widows with young children; and we must add, those more than widows, who have intemperate husbands. For this class slop-work is almost the only resource; and were they justly remunerated, probably three quarters of our list would be struck off at once.. . .        to starve on the [ ].    

       The Providence Juvenile Anti-Slavery Society propose holding a FAIR on the occasion of the annual meeting of the R.I. Anti-Slavery Society, for the benefit of the cause; and they would take this opportunity affectionately to invite the co-operation of all their friends, by contributing such articles as will assist in making up a good assortment for the sale.They will also provide a DINNER, as a reasonable price, for the delegates and friends who may be present from abroad, and others who may seek refreshments at their table, on THURSDAY, the second day of the meeting. They respectfully ask the patronage of all the friends of the cause who may be in attendance on the meeting.      

       The annual meeting of this Society was held on Wednesday Oct. 9th, at Marlboro' Chapel.The Secretary's report was read, and unanimously adopted; and it was voted that it be published under the direction of the Board. The Treasurer's report was likewise read and accepted.An extract of a letter from Elizabeth Pease of London, relating to the affairs of British India, was read by the Secretary, and an interesting document on the same subject. An answer to the letter was read and accepted by the Society, together with the following resolutions:Whereas, we regard the whole human race, [ ] by whatever circumstances, or existing in whatever climate, as one family, and entitled by their Creator to our sympathies; and whereas, we consider the system of slavery, under whatever name or form it obtains, not only a curse upon all concerned in its existence, but as utterly incompatible with the genius of Christianity;Therefore Resolved, 1st., That it is with the deepest sorrow we learn the wretched condition of millions in British India, who are grievously oppressed by the government of Great Britain.2. Resolved, That we view with intense interest, the efforts made by our British sisters to enlighten their own countrymen upon the wrongs and sufferings of their fellow-subjects in India; and that we hail with [ ] thankfulness the organization of Societies among them for the amelioration of their condition.3. Resolved, That we deem the supply of the market by free labor, with the articles hitherto almost wholly the product of the slave, a measure of vast importance; and which cannot fail of sensibly affecting the planters of our own country, causing them to do [ ] that which they should do as an act of harmony and justice; viz. to give to their servants that which is just and equal.4. Resolved, That we trust the time is not far distant when the query, 'Can India not supply England with cotton? shall be answered in the cotton market; the preference given to the produce of freemen over that of slaves thus adorning with another garland the [ ] of British philanthropy.The following are the officers of the Society for the ensuing year;President Mary S. Parker, Vice President, [ ] M. Sullivan; Domestic Corresponding Secretary, M.V. Ball; Foreign Corresponding Secretary, Abby Carter; Recording Secretary, Lydia Gould; Treasurer L.M. Ball; Counsellors, J. Shipley, M.A. [ ] Johnson, M. Scarlett, S. Lewis, and L.L. Fuller.              vast importance;          L. GOULD, Rec. Sec'y. Rec. Sec'y.   Oct. 29, 1839.    

       The fourth annual meeting of the Rhode Island Anti-Slavery Society, will be held on the 13th of November next at Providence.Abolitionists in every town and village throughout the State are requested to appoint delegates to attend the same.

       Pursuant to adjournment from October 17th, a large assemblage of colored citizens of both sexes met in the Infant School Room, Belknap street, on Thursday evening, Oct. 24th, and proceeded to business by appointing THOMAS HENSON Chairman, and WILLIAM C. NELL Secretary. The object of the meeting was stated by the chairman, when on motion, a committee, consisting of John T. Hilton, John Levy, and Benjamin Weeden, was unanimously chosen to draft resolutions for the consideration of the meeting. The Committee reported as follows, viz.Resolved, That the very able manner in which Mr. Garrison defended himself on Thursday evening, Oct. 17th, against the foul slanders of the wolves that seek to devour him, was highly satisfactory to us as a people.Resolved, That we consider it a religious duty to defend Mr. Garrison against every attempt, whether of internal or external foes, to crush him.Resolved, That we hail with joy the fact, that unshaken confidence is reposed in our highly esteemed fellow citizen, WM. LLOYD GARRISON, by the colored people in New Bedford, Worcester, Salem, and elsewhere in this Commonwealth, and regard it as a further proof of their discernment and love of pure principles.Resolved, That we believe it is now made manifest to every colored person, that the design of the new organization is the entire overthrow of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society; and that no artifice is left untried to effect that purpose; and therefore that it ought to be regarded with more jealousy than even the Colonization Society itself.Resolved, That we recommend the Liberator and Cradle of Liberty as worthy of the support of every colored person having a spark of love for liberty and equal rights.Resolved, That the slanders circulated against 'our editor and our paper,' by those who have heretofore labored with him in the cause of humanity, are regarded by us as the 'most unkind cut of all.'Resolved, That all colored persons who are acquainted with the present aspect of the anti-slavery cause in this State, and who enlist with those who seek the overthrow of Garrison and his coadjutors, are enemies to the true interest of the slave, and ought to be treated as such; for no dependence can be placed upon them; if they will betray one man, they are very likely to do so to another.The entire set of resolutions, (except the last,) after being discussed by J.T. Hilton, Thomas Cole, J. Levy, D.D. Rue, S.R. Alexander, G. Washington, C. Pitts, J.B. Cutler, B.P. Bassett, and Miss Smith and others, was unanimously adopted by a rising vote  all standing, both male and female. The last resolution, as first presented by the committee, was opposed by J.G. Barbadoes, G. Putman and D.D. Rue, on the ground that it censured severely many persons, who, though ignorant of the true state of the cause, or otherwise, might lend their influence to the new organization. An amendment was proposed by Wm. C. Nell, and the resolution adopted as above. J.G. Barbadoes and D.D. Rue requested their names to be published as protesting against its adoption.J.T. Hilton offered the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted.Resolved, That we lament the death of BENJAMIN LUNDY, one of the earliest and most devoted friends of our down-trodden and oppressed brethren, who in his decease have lost one that long sympathized with them, and constantly labored to alleviate their sufferings. The cause of humanity has been deprived of one of its firmest pillars.Resolved, That as a token of respect for his memory, we invite our beloved friend, WM. L. GARRISON, to pronounce a Eulogy on his death, and that we solicit the colored citizens generally to unite with us in the appropriate observances of the day.On motion of Thomas Cole, James G. Barbadoes, and J.T. Hilton were appointed a committee to make the necessary arrangements.Voted, That the above proceedings be published in the Liberator. Adjourned sine die.                            sine die.    THOMAS HENSON, Chairman. Chairman.   WM. C. NELL, Secretary.  Secretary.   

            Inscribed to the Intolerant, throughout New England and the Coasts thereof.     The slave is dying in this chain, Unheeded and alone;We see his tears, we feel his pain We make his wrongs our own;But while we labor for redress,Up springs a root of bitterness.We thought, by baskets, caps, and collars,We well might raise one thousand dollars,By which, if properly expended,Would right prevail, and wrong be ended.But, wo the while, a recreant fewRefuse to stitch, or knit, or sew,'Because,' forsooth, 'such fairs as these,Go sore against their consciences!'Now, Abolitionists, be true!We fain would leave the case to you:What kind of conscience can they haveWho will not labor for the slave,By means of FAIRS? Are such defensible,Rejecting means so indispensable?We cannot for one moment doubtYou'll lend your aid to turn them out.Yes, yes! you yield we're of our men sureYet do it gently by a censure.Resolve, that when this note they sounded,The blessed cause they sorely wounded.Tell them the verdict you have found,Is, 'wandered from the ancient ground.'Tell them, with tears, that every minuteThey wrong the cause, by staying in it.Tell them that when with lofty airsThey give their reasons against fairs,Against the bleeding slave they sin;'They've dragged a foreign topic in.'Heed not their free, effectual pleadingAnd other labors for the bleeding:Rejecting fairs, they've 'widely wanderedFrom off the track,' and 'lowered the standard.'If these just views you strongly word,They'll leave us of their own accord,With satisfaction and content;Colonized with their own consent.If not, both duty and proprietyCall loudly for a new society.We must have paper, type, and ink,To rouse men's hearts, and bid them think;And surely all must see with one eye,We cannot get them without money;And loudly all our friends declareWe can't raise funds without a Fair.In demonstration, oh what beauty!Thus fairs become a 'Christian duty.'Then down with Grimke, Kelly, Weld,And all who wickedly beheldThe glories of our needle-cases,With chilling brows or doubtful faces.Denounce them 'in the vein of Ercles,'Who cast contempt on sewing-circles,Those 'spheres appropriate' of woman,By law divine as well as human.To prove it to your heart's content,We have a Bible argument:'She seeks (see Proverbs) flax and wool, And girdles for the merchant maketh:Of scarlet silk her house is full, Her hand the distaff taketh;'(By this, no doubt, the wise man meant'The distaff of accomplishment.')'And then that hand, (the text how sure,)Relieves the needy and the poor.'What man is he, who proudly sneers,As these strained arguments he hearsFrom custom, gospel, law, and chance,In favor of intolerance?'Oh, wad some power the giftie gie him,To see himself as others see him!'Oh, would eternal ProvidenceEnlarge his soul increase his sense,To see that on this mole-hill earth, A congress and a sewing meeting,May each to like events give birth With like parade its members seating;To see that one strong word of truth Is brighter than a world's coercion;That bigotry, with tiger tooth,No chain can break, no anguish soothe; That practice far outgoes assertion;That oft the means which lightest task us,Excel the waters of Damascus;That even from reading doggrel numbers,May Truth go with us to our slumbers.That FREEDOM only is our goal:That every true and faithful soulMust choose its own means to effect it; And, be it, ballot, be it fair,Or free produce, or monthly prayer, Bell, book, or candle, or whate'er,Grant others freedom to reject it.               consciences                           their own accord,                                                 practice assertion               

       At a meeting of the colored citizens of N. Bedford, in pursuance of public notice, held in the colored Christian Church, Friday evening, RICHARD JOHNSON was called to the chair, and NATHANIEL A. BORDEN chosen Secretary.A committee of three, consisting of Ezra R. Johnson, S. Peneton, and Peter Nelson, was appointed to prepare resolutions, who retired for the purpose.A committee of five was appointed to nominate a list of candidates as representatives to the General Court, and instructed to make their report at an adjourned meeting.N.A. Borden offered the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted.Resolved, That 'in union there is strength,' and united we will be.The committee on resolutions then came in and reported the following preamble and resolutions, which were fully discussed and unanimously adopted:Whereas, we believe the time has fully come, when as men, having a just regard for the rights of all men, and particularly for the cause of the oppressed in our land, we deem it our duty, in the exercise of the elective franchise, to consider the cause of liberty and equal rights paramount to all other considerations; and whereas, we believe it to be the duty of all abolitionists, who vote, to do so with direct reference to the cause of human rights and those abolitionists who let predilection for party predominate over their own acknowledged sense of duty, are hypocritical in their professions, and false to the principles of true republicanism;Therefore, Resolved, That we will neither vote for, nor support the election of any man for Governor, or Lieutenant Governor, or for any Legislative office, who is not in favor of the immediate abolition of slavery.Resolved, That we most heartily concur in the nomination of Hon. Nathaniel B. Borden, Seth Whitmarsh, and Foster Hooper, Esq., for senators from this county, as they are our tried friends, and we recommend them to the support of all genuine abolitionists, as men who will faithfully carry out our principles and measures.Voted, That the proceedings of this meeting be published in the papers of this town.Voted, That this meeting stand adjourned to Friday evening, Nov. 8th.                  tried friends        RICHARD JOHNSON, Chairman.

          Alas! how swift the moments fly! How flash the years along!Scarce here, yet some already by! The burden of a song.See childhood, youth, and manhood pass; And age, with furrow'd brow;Time was Time shall be, drain the glass But where in time is now?Time is the measure but of change; No present hour is found;The past the future fill the range Of Time's unceasing round.Where then is now? In realms above, With God's atoning Lamb,In regions of eternal Love, Where sits enthroned I AM.Then, Pilgrim, let thy joys and tears, On time no longer lean;But henceforth all thy hopes and fears, From Earth's affections wean.To God! let votive accents rise; With truth with virtue live;So all the bliss that Time denies, Eternity shall give.         now       now                

       It is related of an eminent citizen of Boston, who was a man of small stature but of great understanding, that being in a room, with a number of 'tall fellows,' one of them asked him how he felt among so many big men. He replied, 'I feel like four-pence half-penny among six cents, equal to them all.' Thus our single star, our little, steady, faithful northern light, as the emblem of liberty, is worth the whole gaudy galaxy that flirts over the proud temples dedicated to liberty, and desecrated to the service of the most barbarous and bloody oppression; oppression, which makes the blood run cold to tell oppression 'Which plucks the rose from the cheek of modesty, And puts a blister there.' -----Who then so inhuman as not to cry, ALL MAIL TO THE NORTHERN STAR, which guides the victims of this dreadful tyranny, TO A SAFE AND FREE HOME; who so impious as not to thank God for their welcome and protection there? Led by the pilot star, they swim broad rivers, and thread deep forests, encountering in the darkness of midnight, (when only they are safe from the pursuit of men,) rattlesnakes and alligators, less cruel than they. With how much justice did the poet say'When the fierce lion urged the cruel chase, When the stern panther sought his midnight prey;What fate reserved me for this CHRISTIAN race A race more savage, more severe than they!'There is another star, as opposite to this as the South pole, the  four-pence half-penny six cents,          another    Sins of Lexus.   This the men-stealers and land-robbers, for forty years our political masters, require as to add to our banners, to deepen (if it be possible) the blot on the national name to increase those infernal lights, those spots of Milton's 'darkness visible,' which are destined, perhaps, to go out in blood. When this (which God avert) shall take place, that still glimmering banner will be altogether changed.No Star shall even faintly shine,But stripes there shall be 'thirty-nine.'  men-stealers land-robbers political   No Star  stripes   D.L.C.     

          Amidst the stillness rose my spirit's cryAmidst the dead. By that full cup of wo,Pressed from the fruitage of mortality,Saviour, for thee! give light that I may know,If by thy will, in thine all-healing name,Men cast down human hearts to blighting shameAnd early death and say, if this be so,Where then is mercy? Whither shall we flee,So unallied to hope, save by our hold on thee.But didst thou not, the deep sea brightly treading,Lift from despair that struggler with the wave?And wert thou not sad tears, but awful, sheddingBeheld, a weeper, at a mortal's grave?And is this weight of anguish, which they bindOn life, this searing to the quick, of mind,That but to God its own free path would crave;This crushing out of hope, and love, and youth,Thy will indeed? Give light! that I may know the truth.For my sick soul is darkened unto death,with shadows from the suffering it hath seen:The strong foundations of my ancient faithSink from beneath me; whereon shall I lean?O! if from thy pure lips was wrung the sighOf the dust's anguish! if like man to dieAnd earth around him shuts heavily hath beenEven to thee bitter, aid me! guide me! turnMy wild and wandering thoughts, back from their starless bourne!      thy                       him  thee     MRS. HEMANS.     

              FALL RIVER, Oct. 18th, 1839.   DEAR SIR,As you are again a candidate for re-election, and as there are many, very many in this Commonwealth, who look upon Slavery, as it exists in these United States, as an evil of the first magnitude an evil that ought to be immediately removed, and that if removed at all, peaceably, is to be done by a proper exercise of the elective franchise, and that therefore in the exercise of that franchise, they ought to be governed, to some extent at least, by the views which the candidate may entertain upon that subject, in consequence of these considerations, I am induced to propound to you the following interrogatories, to wit:1st. Are you in favor of the immediate abolition, by law, of slavery in the District of Columbia, and of the slave-traffic between the States of this Union?2nd. Are you opposed to the admission into the Union of any new State, the Constitution and Government of which tolerates domestic slavery?Believing, sir, as I do, that it is the right of the elector thus to interrogate those who may be candidates for an elective office, I shall make no apology for thus addressing you, but do most earnestly, yet respectfully, request an early reply.I am, Sir, with much esteem,               Your friend and ob't. servant,NATH'L B. BORDEN.    To his Excellency, EDWARD EVERETT.  To his Excellency   

         The first annual meeting of the New England Non-Resistance Society was held in Boston, on the 25th of September, and was continued for three days. Members and friends were present from all the New England States, and from New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The following persons were appointed officers for the ensuing year:President, Effingham L. Capron, Uxbridge, Mass. Vice Presidents, George W. Benson, Brooklyn. Conn.; Peleg Clarke, Coventry, R.I.; John B. Chandler, Concord, N.H.; Orson S. Murray, Brandon, Vt.; Samuel J. May, South Scituate, Mass.; Henry C. Wright, Newburyport, Mass; Corresponding Secretary, William Lloyd Garrison, Recording Secretary, Maria W. Chapman. Treasurer, Charles K. Whipple. Executive Committee, Edmund Quincy, Boston; Joshua V. Himes, Boston; Thankful Southwick, Boston; William Bassett, Lynn; Anna Warren Weston, Weymouth; Oliver Johnson, Boston.The following resolutions were adopted.Resolved, That the only basis upon which a reformatory society can stand and effect its work in the hearts of men, is a sacred respect for the right of opinion.Resolved, That where there is union of heart in a righteous cause, there will be no division growing out of differences of opinion, however wide such differences may be; and that, should divisions ever appear in our ranks, they will prove that the hearts of some of us have become abstracted from the holy principles which drew us together.Resolved, That human life is inviolable, and that no man can rightfully take, threaten, or endanger it.Resolved, That all human, penal codes, as their existence and execution depend on the life-taking power in the hand of man, and necessarily involve an armed and bloody resistance to evil, and the right in man to avenge his own wrongs, are a nullification of the precepts and example of Christ, and cannot innocently be sustained by any of his disciples.Resolved, That man was never made to govern man, but to be governed by his God; that this proposition is clearly established by the Christian Scriptures, by the nature of man, and by the experience of all human governments; and inasmuch as all efforts of men to govern men have ended, and must of necessity end in anarchy and blood, and inasmuch as Christianity requires all men to come under the dominion of the Prince of Peace; therefore it is the solemn duty of man to cease from all efforts to obtain dominion over man, and to strive to bring all under the government of God.Resolved! That while we are applying our principles to civil government, we will not be unmindful of their application to ourselves, in the regulation of our own tempers, and in the government of our families, leading to the abrogation of all inflictions and penalties, and to the substitution of the law of peace and love.Resolved, That with the Board of Managers of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, 'we believe that the anti-slavery cause is founded upon a rock, THE ETERNAL ROCK, and cannot be overthrown; and we blush at the want of faith in its divine origin and holy invincibleness, exhibited by those professed abolitionists who cry out against the free discussion, by individuals, of any question, whether it relate to peace or war, human or divine government, religion or politics, church or state, as endangering the life of the anti-slavery enterprise. Abolition thrives in exact proportion to the growth of free discussion on all moral and political subjects. The examination and discussion of no other question can possibly injure it.'Whereas, Non-Resistance is based on the spirit of universal love, requiring of its subjects suffering and death, if needful to promote the happiness of mankind, and whereas that principle which requires men to lay down their lives, necessarily requires of them the devotion of their property for the promotion of the cause of truth and the benefit of their fellowsTherefore, Resolved, That every true disciple of Jesus Christ will with delight forego the pleasures and luxuries of life, to alleviate human suffering in any form.Resolved, That the charges brought against the holy cause of Non-Resistance in the Marlboro' Chapel last evening, by Nathaniel Colver, (a professed minister of the gospel,) to wit, that it is not 'peaceable,' but 'a beast with horns,' that it is 'unscriptural,' 'unphilosophical,' 'blind,' 'inconsiderate,' a 'filthy' and 'new-fangled scheme,' and in its tendency leads to 'anarchy,' 'jabobinism,' 'infidelity,' and 'atheism,' are false charges, and excite our pity and compassion for the accuser, whom we beseech a merciful God to bring out of the empire of darkness into the kingdom of righteousness and peace.Resolved, That it was by such false accusations on the part of the chief priests, scribes, and pharisees, that tumults arose against Jesus, the Captain of our salvation; that he was treated as one having a devil, and ignominiously crucified between two thieves; and that his apostles were persecuted from city to city, and at last suffered martyrdom.Resolved, That in preferring these charges against non-resistance, Nathaniel Colver has breathed the spirit and imitated the example of those who have fill-. . . abolitionists in a similar manner, for all which we desire for him perfect forgiveness.Whereas, the resistance of evil, by violence and bloodshed, is contrary to the spirit, and in violation of the doctrine and example of Jesus Christ,Therefore, Resolved, That the persons claiming to be the ministers and churches of Jesus Christ, who justify such resistance, either in individuals or in nations, or who refuse to bear their testimony against it, are unworthy of the name they assume, and partake of the guilt, and are responsible for the miseries which such resistance necessarily involves.Whereas, it is the fundamental principle of American institutions, that the sovereign power resides in the people; and whereas, what is termed the government, either of the United States or of the several states, is but the exercise of certain of the sovereign powers of the people by servants of their own, appointed for that purpose, and responsible to themselves; and whereas the people, in their collective capacity, can have no attributes of sovereignty which each individual does not possess, and can confer no powers on their servants which do not originally reside in each member of the community; and whereas the civil government of this country, as established by the constitutions of the United States, and of the several states, is founded upon the assumed right to take human life at discretion, and is invested with power to make and conduct war, to establish armies, navies, and a militia system, to declare at their pleasure what acts are crimes, and to punish them with imprisonment or death:Therefore, Resolved, That every man who takes part, by voting or otherwise, in the civil government of this country, arrogates to himself the right of taking life at his discretion, and of avenging himself upon his enemies by any means he may deem most for his own advantage, and thereby violates the spirit and precepts of Christianity.Resolved, That every man thus consenting to the civil government of this country, is responsible to God and man for the evils, and is accessory to the crimes, which are the necessary consequences of those false principles, when made the basis of legislative action, of which responsibility he can only divest himself, by immediately repenting of his participation in the system from which these crimes and evils flow, and instantly abandoning it.Resolved, That it will be impossible for us, while true to our principles, to attempt the subversion of any established civil government, however arbitrary, corrupt or oppressive, by enforced legislation or by armed resistance; but only by the spiritual regeneration of the members of the community which has ordained it.Resolved, That the militia system of the United States is identical, in its principles and tendencies, with the armed establishments upon which all tyrannies and despotisms rest; that so far from being a safeguard of property, liberty and life, the sanguinary principles it inculcates, the ferocious spirit it breathes, and the slavish habits it creates, are proved by the history of the world to have been the source of almost all the robbery and oppression under which the world has ever groaned; and that just in proportion as the militia system is popular and prosperous, are all our dearest rights in danger of destruction.Resolved, That the professed object for which the Militia System is maintained, is none other than deliberate murder; that every man who forms a part of it, from the Commander-in-Chief to the private soldier, is legally bound to do deeds of murder; and that it is the duty of every disciple of Christ, and of every lover of his kind, to refuse at all hazards, to partake in any wise of its bloody abominations, and to bear at all times his testimony against them.Resolved, That the militia laws of those States which give a preference to certain classes of Christians, conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms, are unconstitutional, unequal and unjust; and that it is the duty of all lovers of freedom to protest against such inequality.Resolved, That the abolition of slavery is involved in the doctrines of non-resistance, as the unit is included within the aggregate; for if a slaveholder become non-resistant, he never again could strike a slave; never compel him to labor; never reclaim him, if he chose to leave him; in a word, never resort to that law of violence, in which the relation of master and slave originated, and by which it must be continually sustained.Resolved, That navies and standing armies, on which human governments rely for defence against domestic insurrections and foreign invasions, instead of answering the end for which they are designed, are, in fact, the means of destruction to morals, property and life; and in proportion as men, organized into governments, trust to such means for protection, they distrust the promises and power of God, become alienated in their hearts from the spirit of Christ, and incite each other to mutual hatred and deeds of violence.Resolved, That the appointment of Chaplains to the Army, Navy and Militia of this and other countries, is the masterpiece of Satanic contrivance to sanctify, by the forms of religion, institutions which are diabolical in their spirit and design, which belong to the kingdom of darkness, and the overthrow of which is essential to the triumph of Christianity in the earth.Resolved, That those who consent to act as Chaplains in military systems, are not to be regarded as ministers of Christ, and their assumption of that character, or of the Christian name, is an outrage and a mockery.Whereas, Military Academies and Naval Schools, being designed and adapted to teach the most effectual mode of rendering evil for evil, and having therefore a direct tendency to discourage the Christian virtues of meekness, forbearance, humility, forgiveness, and the love of enemies, are not only unchristian, but anti-christian institutions:Therefore, Resolved, That aid, support or encouragement, afforded to such institutions, is practical opposition to Christianity, and that he who places a pupil under such tuition, devotes him to labor for the destruction of Christ's kingdom on earth.Resolved, That all persons, without distinction of sex or color, from all sections of the country and every quarter of the world, who assent to the principles of the N.E. Non-Resistance Society, are hereby affectionately invited to become members, and partake of its privileges and sacrifices.Resolved, That this resolution be printed in connection with the Constitution.                                                    strike compel         anti-christian         

       WATERTOWN, 24th Oct. 1839.    DEAR SIR:On Saturday last I duly received your letter of the 18th, propounding to me certain interrogatories, and earnestly requesting an early answer.You are aware that several Resolves, on the subject of those inquiries and other kindred topics, accompanied by a very able report, was introduced into the Senate of the Commonwealth the year before last, by a joint committee of the two houses of which the late greatly lamented Mr. Alvord was chairman. Those Resolves, after having been somewhat enlarged by amendment, were adopted by the Legislature.They appear to me to cover the whole ground of your two interrogatories. Having cheerfully co-operated in the passage of the resolves, and concurring in the general reasoning by which they were sustained, in the powerful report of the chairman of the committee, I respond to both your inquiries in the affirmative.The first of the three subjects, embraced in your inquiry, is the only one of them which came before Congress while I was a member. I voted in the negative, on a motion to lay upon the table the petition of the American Anti-Slavery Society for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and on the other motions of like character, intended to cast off the consideration of this class of petitions.I am, dear sir, very respectfully,               Your friend and servant,EDWARD EVERETT.    HON. NATHANIEL B. BORDEN.    

         Mr. Editor At their session in Barnet, 7th August, 1839, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted by the Caledonia Association:1. Resolved, That we cannot but regard the institution of Domestic Slavery as entirely inconsistent, alike with the spirit of our free institutions, with all true humanity, with natural justice, and with the spirit and fruits of the gospel.*2. Resolved, That thus regarding this institution, we are constrained to believe** that the Gospel of Christ requires its immediate abolition.3. Resolved, That the long continued existence of such an institution in the United States justly subjects us as a people, and especially our Southern States, to the strong disapprobation of the wise and good of all nations.***4. Resolved, That we affectionately but earnestly entreat our Southern brethren who are slaveholders, at once to give the subject of immediate emancipation their prayerful attention.(4*)5. Resolved, That while we are earnest in our wishes for the abolition of American Slavery, we strongly disapprove of much of the spirit manifested, and much of the language adopted in the discussion of the subject, and exhort our brethren to be kind and courteous in their treatment of it.(5*)6. Resolved, That however much we respect private character and desire female aid in promoting enterprises of benevolence, we deprecate as unnatural, and repugnant to the principles of Christian modesty, all attempts to withdraw females from their appropriate sphere of influence, and bring them before the public as lecturers, as voters, and debaters in promiscuous assemblies.(6*)                 DAVID SUTHERLAND, Moderator. Moderator.   WILLIAM SCALES, Jr. Sec. pro tem.  Sec. pro tem.   * Mark the reluctant style of these resolves 'We cannot but regard' or we would not so regard if we could help it and sure enough they would not. It is an extracted confession a forced acknowledgment drawn out like a tooth. And what a declaration of the character of the hellish system by a Caledonia Association. Oh how unlike the brave region of the name beyond the waters. It is Scotland transplanted away from home and at this time of day, and after the hideous developments of the 'Thousand witnesses.' 'Inconsistent with free institutions'  The dragon it is! You don't say so! What! SLAVERY inconsistent with, or discordant with LIBERTY! Slavery and Freedom inconsistent with each other! Are not our Association a little too fast? 'Natural justice,' too! Inconsistent with that? Can't they help regarding it so? It is unjust, or as it were, unjust, to plunder a man utterly! Is that getting to be reckoned inconsistent with natural justice, up among the Vermont hills and pulpits? What would they say of Slavery there, if the old scaly. Hydra should reach out her obscure clutch, and take up a Caledonia County born white child, and transfer it to the plantation; the red cheeked boy of some Walden farmer or one of the yeomen of Barnet! Would they talk of inconsistency with free institutions then or any of this dish-water phrase! No. Vermont would thunder from all her mountains, and roar throughout her hundred hollows, like an earthquake. A cloud of Green Mountain Boys would descend upon the South, like the northern Hive upon Rome, and they would not leave a plantation unsearched to the gulf of Mexico, but what they would find the boy, and have him home.** There again in real Caledonia style the old Covenanter spirit. 'We are constrained to believe.' Surely the Association must have strained to give utterance to such a bold sentiment. And this, after all the civilized world is burning with indignation against the horrid system, and mustering the scorn of mankind for its extinction. This Association is just getting to be constrained into a belief about it.*** Yes, we think it has been carried on a little too long. The thing itself is not so had but it has been going on so long it is subjecting us, especially the bloody-handed, gory-skirted South to strong disapprobation that is to say, the good and wise don't approve of their carrying it on so long! It is time they should begin to think of putting an ultimate stop to it as Mr. Sutherland says.(4*) Beloved brethren, men-stealing, woman-flogging child-selling brethren! we entreat you, affectionately (we don't assail you like these cut-throat abolitionists) and earnestly, that you would at once (knock off your slave's fetters, and let him live and breathe, like a man? Not by a horn full, but) give the subject your prayerful attention! We'll put down the doctrine of immediate emancipation here at the north. We'll scout it from every meeting-house, and scout it out of every association. And mean time, mind what we say, you go give this same subject your prayerful attention! Who shall dare call us pro-slavery, when we say all this to the South?(5*) Now comes the other side of the question now the Rev. brethren can talk of joining hands. They a'nt afraid to let out. 'We strongly disapprove the spirit,' &c. They are constrained to believe slavery inconsistent, &c. But abolitionism the spirit and language of immediate emancipation, 'they can strongly disapprove' kindness and courtesy towards slavery but mobs and expulsion to the abolitionists.(6*) And they wound up on the Woman question! Pro-slavery is sound to the core on that. We commend this to our brethren of the 'New Organization.' Kind and courteous towards slavery, these Caledonians are rough as John Knox against the insubordinate abolition woman. They can hold their peace against yoking up men and women in the coffee, and driving out feeble woman, at day break, with her white infant at her back the offspring of some beloved Southern brother and the old dull slave hoe in her horn-hard hands to the cotton row or 'the rice swamp dank.' There is no departing from spheres here, to speak of. This is all womanish enough for she is the weaker vessel and was first in the transgression, and her province is clearly 'domestic and subordinate.' But for her to lecture to an assembly a promiscuous one mixed up like a parish congregation, that she should hold up her hand in decision of questions, and dispute on moral subjects before men, this is 'unnatural' (so is piety,) and 'repugnant to christian modesty.' But we are sick of commenting on such miserable, semi-barbarous common place. Herald of Freedom. inconsistent help regarding unjust, as it were, getting inconsistent  inconsistency   strained constrained into a belief    don't approve so long! ultimate      joining hands. constrained kindness courtesy   to speak of. is 'domestic subordinate.' promiscuous piety,  Herald of Freedom.    

          SANDISFIELD, Oct. 19th, 1839.   FRANCIS JACKSON, ESQ.Dear Sir. Your communication of the 11th inst. has remained unanswered thus long, on account of some pressing occupations.'Without asking any pledge' from me, you desire to know my present opinions1st. 'As to the propriety of the immediate abolition by law, of slavery in the District of Columbia, and of the slave traffic between the States of this Union.'And 2nd. 'If I am opposed to the admission of any new State into the Union whose Constitution of Government shall tolerate domestic slavery.'I now avail myself of a leisure moment to reply to your inquiries with the same frankness and friendly feeling with which they were propounded.Not having contemplated being placed in a position, (if elected to the office for which I am a candidate) where I should be called to act officially, on this momentous question, I confess I have not investigated the subject so faithfully and critically as I should have felt bound to do, had it been otherwise, [ ] I should not have been prepared to pledge myself definitely on the subject of your first inquiry, had you asked it.In common with a vast majority of the citizens of New England, I deprecate the curse of slavery, and wish it removed in the speediest manner consistent with the safety of all concerned. It seems to me that the General Government have a right to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia to prohibit the domestic slave trade, and to refuse the admission of new States whose Constitution tolerates domestic slavery, and that they should exercise it.Very respectfully,    Dear Sir.           pledge        Your ob't. servant,GEORGE HULL.      

            We recorded yesterday, the destruction of 500 or 600 house in Mobile on the night of the 7th inst. They were mostly small, and the damage is estimated in the Mobile papers at only $120,000. In prosperous times, we are told, the destruction of these houses would hardly have been deemed a calamity to the city; but at present the case is otherwise.Letters of the 9th inst. announce the occurrence of yet another fire in that unfortunate city, which, although it destroyed comparatively few buildings, caused a much greater loss of property than the other; the buildings burnt being among the best in the city. A gentleman well acquainted in Mobile, estimates the loss by this fire at $750,000. The Bank building alone cost about $200,000. The two Hotels were also expensive and valuable buildings.  only     

       Dr. Cowdrey, the Secretary of the Middlesex County A.S. Society, has sent us for publication the following letters received by him from senatorial candidates in that county, in reply to the interrogatories which he addressed to them.     LEXINGTON, Oct. 21, 1839.   DEAR SIR:I have received your communication in behalf of a committee of the Middlesex Co. A.S. Society, of the 7th inst desiring a reply to the following interrogatories, viz.'1st. Are you in favor of the Legislature of Mass. instructing the Senators, and requesting the Representatives of the State, in Congress, to use their influence for the immediate abolition of slavery and the slave-trade in the District of Columbia and the Territories; and, also, for the prohibition of the slave trade between the States?2nd. Are you in favor of the Legislature of Mass. protesting against the admission to the Union of any new State, whose Constitution tolerates slavery?3. Are you in favor of repealing all laws of this State, which make distinction among men on account of color?'I do not wish to use any reserve, in regard to my sentiments upon the 'great moral and political questions' which at present agitate our community; but, still, I have some preference as to the time and manner of making them known. In submitting myself to your interrogations, I will endeavor to be explicit, and shall trust to your candor and honor for a correct interpretation of my views. I have objected, and do still object, decidedly, to the exaction of pledges as the condition of support at the polls. This sentiment, I can assure you, does not arise from any unwillingness to communicate freely with my fellow-citizens on matters of public interest, or from a desire to deprive them of the means hereafter, should I be elected, of comparing my acts with my professions. With this explanation of my feelings, I shall reply to the interrogatories you have propounded to me.In respect to the first and second of your inquiries, my present sentiments are in accordance with those expressed by my votes given on questions involving the subject of slavery, brought to the consideration of that branch of the Legislature, of which I was a member during the last session, including these very questions; therefore, I respond affirmatively.It only remains for me to consider the third branch of your inquiries. To this I should also reply, as I have to those preceding it, if I was aware of the existence of any law of this Commonwealth, that could fairly be considered as making any distinction among its citizens on account of color. Reference to the statutes shows, that the only decrees alluding to the color of the inhabitants are those of marriage and divorce. That which silently exempts the man of color from the performance of duty in the militia, is derived from the authority of Congress, and by that power alone can it be rescinded.The 5th section of the 75th chap. of the Revised Statutes, re-affirming an act of 1786, declares, that 'no white person shall intermarry with an Indian, Negro, or Mulatto.' This to me does not seem to establish any inequality on account of color; it bestows no privilege on one race that is denied to the other. By no written authority of this State is the colored citizen restrained, in any degree, from the enjoyment of as much civil, social, and political liberty, as the white. The cases would doubtless be rare, in which either race would desire intermarriage with the other. In times of excitement on this topic, they might sometimes occur. To restrain the white from any infringement of that law of nature, which he, perhaps, quite as often as the colored man, might seek to violate, may in extreme cases render our present statute of value.Taking this view of the laws of the State, which in any degree touch the subject of color, I do not consider it important to the welfare and happiness of the community, or to the benevolent endeavors for the improvement of the condition of the whole human family, whether 'bond or free,' that the laws in question should be immediately repealed.            correct   respond affirmatively.   third   any white      Very respectfully,SAMUEL CHANDLER.    H. COWDREY, ESQ.    

          MOBILE, Oct. 9, 1839.   We have had another fire. The Mansion house, the large unfinished hotel south of it, and the Planters & Merchants' Bank are burnt, besides a number of valuable houses opposite the two former, and several houses on the north side of Government street, and a portion of the market. No doubt the work of incendiaries.The Planters and Merchants' Bank would have been saved, but for the Cupola, &c. &c. The books and bills receivable, and I believe all the valuables of the Bank, are saved. I was nearly four hours in the Bank assisting in endeavors to save it.      

     HOPKINTON, Oct. 23, 1839.   DR. H. COWDREY:SIR Some days since, I received from you, on behalf of the Middlesex Co. A.S. Society, a series of questions upon the subject of slavery, with a request for an immediate reply.After the election last autumn, I received a letter from you and Mr. John Fletcher, which stated that you should vote for me as a temperance man, and expressed a hope that the poor slave might not suffer through your voting for me. To that letter I returned an answer by mail, in which I avowed my long continued abhorrence of slavery, and my willingness to do, at all times, whatever might seem to me constitutional and expedient for its utter extinction. At the same time, I claimed for myself the free exercise of my judgment upon the propriety of any measure, which might come before me as a member of the legislature. I also stated, that I had voted in favor of the measures which had been recently adopted by our legislature, in opposition to slavery. A part of those measures were the reports and resolves presented to the Senate in 1838, by my late and lamented friend, Mr. Alvord, which, in spirit, if not in letter, cover the entire ground of your first and second questions.The remaining question is, perhaps, broad enough to embrace the laws relating to the Indians. Whether it was so intended or not, I do not know; but if it were, then it comprehends subject matters, so different in themselves and their relations, that I do not think it could be wisely answered in general terms, either in the affirmative or the negative. If the question be intended to apply only to the provision, that 'no white person shall intermarry with a negro, indian, or mulatto;' restricted as this prohibition has been by the decisions of the courts, I do not believe that it prevents the marriage of a single couple in the commonwealth during a year. There are other and much more powerful causes than any provisions of the law, which operate to restrain such connexions; and I claim for myself what I should be willing to concede to any other, for whom I would vote, the unpledged exercise of my judgment, if I should ever be called to act upon the question.           Yours, respectfully,SAMUEL B. WALCOTT.      

         First Colored Female Benevolent Society, of Portland.   Whereas, we the colored females of Portland, deeply regret our inability to ameliorate the condition of a number of our sex, who are exposed to the various vicissitudes of fortune. The hand of sickness, which no human art can avert, frequently renders them incompetent to realize the necessary comforts of life, and in some measure dependent upon their fellow-creatures for the necessaries thereof. Here, then, is held out an asylum, where frail nature may find a shelter from the rude storms of misfortune, by a decent deportment through life and strict adherence to the articles which form this constitution.ARTICLE 1. This Society shall be styled the First Colored Female Benevolent Society of Portland.ARTICLE 2. The officers of this Society shall be a President, Vice President, Secretary, Assistant Sec. Treasurer, and a Board of four Managers, the whole to be elected annually. In case of death, resignation, expulsion or removal of either of the aforesaid officers from the limits of the Society, the President shall appoint one of the members, pro tempore, until the next stated or special meeting of the Society, when there shall be a member elected to fill such vacancy, until the next annual election. Any member who shall be appointed by the President as specified above, and shall refuse to accept, shall be fined twenty-five cents, unless she assigns a satisfactory excuse.ARTICLE 3. It shall be the duty of the President, and in her absence the Vice President, to preside over all the meetings of the Society, to preserve order and decorum therein, to regulate debates, decide on all questions of order, subject to an appeal, and shall direct the Secretary to call all special meetings, when the Board of Managers may deem them necessary, or on application of seven of the members in writing.ARTICLE 4. The Treasurer shall receive from the Board of Managers all moneys paid into their hands from time to time, for the use of the Society. She shall pay all orders signed by the President, and countersigned by the Secretary, which orders shall be vouchers for her expenditures. Previous to entering on the duty of her office, she shall give bond and security for the faithful performance of her trust. She shall furnish to the society at their stated meeting once in three months, an accurate statement of the funds, and shall give to her successor in office within three days after such election, all monies and effects belonging to them, remaining in her possession.ARTICLE 5. It shall be the duty of the Secretary, to keep a fair and accurate account of the proceedings of the Society, in such a book as shall be provided for that purpose, to adjust all accounts of one month's standing. Also to notify members of their election or expulsion, to keep a correct statement of all monies due the society, to call extra meetings when ordered by proper authority, to notify all members who have been absent for two months and transact all other business of the Society, which may be imposed upon her from time to time.ARTICLE 6. It shall be the duty of the Board of Managers to transact all business of the Society, as relates to sick members. If any member be taken sick and wishes to receive the beneficence of this Society, she shall send information to one of the Managers, who immediately after receiving such notice, and if she shall be thought entitled to relief, they shall pay her weekly the sum of one dollar. Nevertheless she shall be allowed but one week's beneficence after her application, if her case be a doubtful one.The Board of Managers shall see that each of the members take their respective turns in sitting up with the afflicted member or members at night.ARTICLE 7. Candidates for membership must be females of good moral character, and must be recommended by one or two of the members, and upon being balloted for, the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present, shall be requisite for their election, after which they may become members of this Society, by signing the Constitution and paying a sum equivalent to what each member has paid into the funds since it has been a standing Society, and not less than twelve and a half cents a month for the benefit of the fund.ARTICLE 8. The benefit of this society shall be as follows: If a member be taken sick and confined to her bed, she shall be allowed the sum of one dollar a week, during her inability. Should such sickness terminate in death, the society shall defray the funeral expenses.ARTICLE 9. Should any member neglect to pay her monthly contribution, for three months successively, she shall be expelled from the society, and forfeit all right therein. Nevertheless any member so forfeiting her membership, and should wish to continue in the society, she shall be allowed the further privilege of making appeal within the fourth month after, and assign her reasons for such neglect, and should her excuse be satisfactory to a majority of the members then present, she may thereupon be reinstalled in the Society, by paying up all arrearages, and a fine of twenty-five cents for such an offence.ARTICLE 10. Should any member by immoral conduct, bring disgrace upon herself, family, or this Society, she shall be notified by the President to attend the next stated or monthly meeting of the Society, to answer to the same, and after having the list or charges exhibited against her, the accused member may offer his defence, when a decision shall be made thereon by ballot, and if it appears that a majority of the members present consider the accused member guilty of such charge or charges, she shall be expelled from the Society. Nevertheless a member thus expelled shall have the right of appeal at the next stated meeting of the Society, when the decision shall be final.ARTICLE 11. All by-laws attaching fines and penalties shall be considered obligatory.ARTICLE 12. Should any member of this Society report the proceedings of the meeting to any person or persons not members of the same, where by disgrace, difficulty or trouble should arise to any of its members, such person shall pay a fine of one dollar; and if she refuses to pay said fine, she shall be expelled from the society and forfeit all rights therein.ARTICLE 13. The members of this Society shall have power to make such by-laws from time to time, to carry into effect the true intent and meaning of the Constitution. Any alteration or amendment to this Constitution, must be proposed one month previous to its discussion, and shall not be adopted unless two thirds of the members present concur therein.ARTICLE 14. This Society shall not be abrogated or dissolved, whilst there are five members willing to continue.    First Colored Female Benevolent Society of Portland.   pro tempore,                             

     WALTHAM, Oct. 14, 1839.   DEAR SIR:For an answer to the first and second interrogatory which you propose to me, I refer you to the resolves of the first and second Legislature of 1838, of which I approve. Of the expediency of so soon re-enacting similar resolves, I must be permitted to doubt.In reference to the third interrogatory, I am constrained to say, that I am not aware of any laws upon the statute book of Massachusetts, which make distinction among men on account of color. If, however, any such there be, I should most cheerfully co-operate in their repeal.         Very respectfully   H. COWDREY, ESQ.     LUTHER FISHER.     

         This matter came before Judge Inglis yesterday at his chambers, in pursuance of the order he had made in the case.The Counsel for Montez and Ruiz read an affidavit made by Montez, in which he stated that he had been arrested at the suit of Jingua, and was required to give bail in the sum of $1000, which he could not procure, and was therefore obliged to go to prison; that the said Jingua is the property of deponent and a subject of the Queen of Spain, and that the deponent purchased him at Havana, in the Isle of Cuba, where slavery is recognized by the laws of Spain; and that deponent did not, nor does not know, that the said Jingua is an African by birth; that he, deponent, purchased forty other negroes at the same time, and got a license from the Governor of Havana to transport them on board a ship to his place of residence, and that it is not true, that the said slaves were taken on board at night, as they were brought on board before it was dark. The affidavit further states that the slaves were not manacled while on board, and that they had been supplied with sufficient provisions. The deponent also swears that he believes this suit was commenced against him without the concurrence or knowledge of the plaintiff, and by Lewis Tappan.There was an affidavit of Ruiz also read, corroboratory of the affidavit of Montez, and an affidavit in relation to the arrest of the defendants, and the assistance given in the matter by Mr. Tappan.Theodore Sedgwick, Jr. on the part of the plaintiffs in the suit, read the affidavit on which the defendants were arrested, and an affidavit of their being non-residents, and here only transitorily. He also read the affidavits of Joshua Leavitt and Lewis Tappan, stating that they had visited the colored men accompanied by interpreters, and that deponents believed these colored men were natives of Africa, and recently from Africa. An affidavit of the deputy sheriff, who arrested the defendants, was next read, and in this he deposed that he had been directed to give the defendants as much privilege as he could consistently with his duty, and that he went with them to a place in Grand street to procure bail; that a person there offered to become bail for them, and that the deputy sheriff offered to take his bail, but that the defendants would not consent to the arrangement, and went to prison.Mr. Sedgwick then said that as he had furnished proof of these man being native Africans, he would now read the treaty made between England and Spain, in the year 1817, to put down the slave trade.Counsel for defendants objected to this document being read, as the common law of Spain, on the ground of informality. He did not think counsel for the plaintiffs had any right to read the book, as it might not be genuine. The other parts might have got it printed for this purpose. He would, however, consent to the gentleman's examining Spanish lawyers, of whom there were many in this city, as to the common law of Spain.Mr. Sedgwick replied that this objection might be pertinent when the case came to trial, but as the case had been brought to a hearing on a twelve hours' order, it did not furnish quite sufficient time to send to Madrid or Cuba for such authority as would be decisive on the subject.Judge Inglis said, I think that the same rule applies here as at a trial. I am not bound to know that these are the laws of Spain, unless proved in a legitimate way. I have no more power here than I would if it was a trial for assault and battery that was before me. But I will let you read the document, and afterwards shut it out de bene esse, if on considering the matter I am of opinion that the law is no sufficiently proved. Another circumstance which must be considered is, that this treaty is between Great Britain and Spain, and I do not know that it would have any, obligatory force on Spain with any other nation except England.Mr. Sedgwick then read the document from a book which he obtained from the office of the British Consul, containing various treaties between Great Britain and other nations. From this document it appeared that in conformity with a treaty entered into between Spain and England, the King of Spain, in the month of December, 1817, issued a decree prohibiting all subjects of Spain from resorting to the coasts of Africa for slaves, after the 30th of May, 1820, and further providing that in case any slaves were brought from Africa after the prohibited period, the negroes so brought were to be set free on the first port of the Spanish dominions, at which the vessel might arrive, and that the vessel should be confiscated.Counsel for defendants contended that the affidavits on which the defendants had been arrested were untrue and informal, in proof of which he referred to the affidavits he had read, and on those grounds he moved that the defendants should be set at liberty.Mr. Sedgwick said that his object in bringing this case before a jury was, because it was the only way in which the question could be passed on, whether these colored men were free or slaves. He was able to prove that slavery, so far as it regards men of color coming from Africa, is no longer tolerated in Cuba, and that bringing them there, subjects the person who does it to severe punishment. The defendants could not have but known that those men were brought to Cuba in violation of the laws of Spain, and the least criminal position in which the defendants stood was that of buyers of contraband goods, and aiding and abetting the slave trade.The defendants swore that they did not know these men were native born Africans. When they bought them, but such could not be the truth, because the defendants knew that those men spoke no language but their native African dialect, and could not even understand any other. This alone was sufficient to have put the defendants on their guard, and must have made them aware that they were violating the laws of Spain.Mr. Staples, Counsel for the plaintiffs, then addressed the Court, and was replied to by Counsel for the defendants.Judge Inglis deferred giving his decision for a day or two.                de bene esse,               

 The following note was sent by the Editor of the Boston Daily Advertiser to Francis Jackson, re-enclosing the letter of Governor Everett, on Slavery. We have not room for comment on his remark, that he does not see that the question of slavery has any thing to do with the present election. The editor of the Daily, to judge from his mode of conducting that journal, is one of that large class who believe the laws, and the men who are to make them, should be fitted to advance the material rather than the moral interests of our country, that is, provided our attention to the latter is likely to cause any derangement of business. He belongs emphatically to 'the sound part of the community,' as they name themselves men who are not for disturbing ancient abuses, so long as they are tolerably popular and considerably profitable.We must confess our surprise that the editor of the Daily should designate the letter of Governor Everett as irrelevant to the present election. This strikes us as amounting to something very near disrespect to his Excellency, as the head of the whig party in this State, who answers Mr. Borden's letter avowedly on the ground that it has something to do with the present election. We are the more surprised, because the editor has never before been known to smother any of the many meritorious acts of either of his very eminent brothers.We rejoice to see in the frank and satisfactory letter of his Excellency, that he is above being influenced by the timid and selfish counsels of some who surround him.F. JACKSON, ESQ.DEAR SIR As I do not conceive that the subject of abolition has any proper connection with the present election, I do not propose to go into any discussion of it in my paper, at this time. I therefore beg leave to return to you the enclosed paper.      has          Very respectfully, your ob't servant,NATHAN HALE.    Boston, Oct. 30.    

       The Massachusetts Abolitionist contains the following letter, from this eloquent advocate of emancipation, addressed to JOHN E. FULLER, of Boston.     Manchester, England, Sept. 20, 1839. Manchester, England, Sept.   My Dear Friend, Within a few minutes after the receipt of yours, through the hands of my excellent fellow-laborer, John Scoble, I take up my pen to confess my faults, ask your forgiveness, and promise amendment, if my life and health continue.I am rejoiced to find Scoble has had so many and such favorable opportunities of laying the results of Emancipation, in the West Indies, before the inhabitants of your country. His facts have made the argument complete, and left all who have heard him without excuse, even upon their own principles, if they do not espouse and carry on a cause which is so good in its object, and so happy in its consequences: I am endeavoring to rouse my country to strike an effectual blow at the slavery of yours. We are, as you know, the great consumers of the produce of slave labor, and therefore the great supporters of slavery. I am determined to cry aloud, and spare not, against the double wickedness of neglecting our own population in the East, and sustaining the slave system of the West. I am now in the region of cotton bags. I have only to annihilate, in imagination, the Atlantic which rolls between, and then, in addition to towering chimneys, and clanking machinery, and the picture of pale-faced factory slaves, I have plantations, and drivers, cart-whips, and chains, and negro slaves. On Wednesday next, I deliver the first of a series of lecture in this great town. I intend to lecture in Liverpool, and all the other principal towns of this wide district, upon the subject. Let us hear your voice, in thunder tones, upon this question. We have a country in India, over an area of 200,000 square miles of which we could grow the indigenous cotton of the country, besides extensive tracts on which we could cultivate to perfection every kind of cotton seed we have upon this fertile soil millions of fine husbandmen, famishing for want of profitable employment, and yet we are dependant upon your southwestern states for seven-eighths of the cotton we consume. O shameless inconsistency! O guilty confederacy with the brokers in blood with whom you are contending! See you not that this little island holds in her hands the destinies of the slaves of America? See you not that justice to India is freedom to the American captive? Speak to us, then. In mercy to your slave population, speak. If you can rebuke us into better, wiser conduct, you will not only be loosening the fetter of the sable bondman on your own shores, but blessing the tawny Hindoo upon the 'coral strand' of India       Yours, faithfully,GEORGE THOMPSON.      

 ANOTHER ALLEGED AMERICAN SLAVER CAPTURED. Among the vessels which arrived at this port yesterday, is the schr. Catherine, Capt. Dundas, of Baltimore, 39 days from Sierra Leone, a prize to H.B.M. brig Dolphin. She was seized on a charge of being engaged in the Slave Trade; and is brought to this country out of respect to the American government, instead of being adjudicated upon at Sierra Leone, as she would have been, if belonging to any nation with which the Br government has a treaty for the suppression of the slave trade. Four of the original crew of the Catherine are on board. The remainder, about 30, were discharged on the Coast. We understand she has an American register on board, and she is said to be owned in Baltimore. She was fitted out at Havana, where she took up her cargo. Journal of Commerce.   at Havana, Journal of Commerce.   

 We have a letter from Havana, dated early in Oct. which says, 'Within the last ten days, four Guinea-men have sailed for Africa under the American flag. Last week three full cargoes of slaves arrived in American bottoms, under the Portugese flag; but each vessel brought back an American Captain.' We trust the two vessels of war about to be despatched to the African coast by the Navy Department, will be speedily on their way, and that they will give a good account of the villains engaged in this nefarious business. Jour. Com.    Jour. Com.   

 THE NEW ART OF PHOTOGRAPHY. By the Liverpool, which arrived just before our paper went to press last week, we received from London a little volume giving the history of the new art of Photography, with the proceedings of the French government in their purchase of the secrets of M. Daguerre's discovery; together with a full and minute account of the whole process of fixing the images of the Camera Obscura, and directions for the construction of every part of the apparatus, illustrated by six plates. We have put the plates into the hands of our engraver, and propose to publish them, with M. Daguerre's account of his process next week.G.W. Prosch, philosophical instrument maker 140 Nassau street, is engaged in making the necessary instruments for obtaining photographic pictures by the process of M. Daguerre, and it cannot be long before the public will be gratified with the sight of perfect specimens. N.Y. Observer.     N.Y. Observer.   

 A PATRIARCH. There is now living in Lynn, a gentleman, Mr. Noah Pike, who is the father of twenty-three children. He has had two wives, one of whom is living. By the first wife he bad twelve children, by the second eleven. There are eleven sons, and twelve daughters, most of whom are living. The sons are large and robust. One son weighs 220, and two others over 200 each. Mr. Pike was born in 1774, married when he was 20, and his youngest child is five years of age. The town, to its great credit, does not impose any taxes upon him, concluding, we suppose, that he has contributed his share to the prosperity of the State.     

 REV. JOHN PIERPONT. The editor of the Coos County (N.H.) Democrat, speaking of the late proceedings at Hollis Street church says: 'In our opinion, the pastor is in this case better able to lose the church, than the church is to dismiss him. John Pierpont can find churches any where but the Hollis street church can't find another John Pierpont.'A writer in the Newburyport Watchtower, speaking of Mr. Pierpont's first letter, says: 'It is worthy to be written in letters of gold, and to be kept in every family as a memento of the independence, which should characterize every minister of the gospel.     gold, independence,   

 TEXAN INDEPENDENCE. The Gladiator, of Vermillionville, (Lou.) states that a traveller, who passed through that town on the 20th ult. from Houston, reported that the Morning Star of Houston had announced that Mexico had recognized the Independence of Texas, and that the event was celebrated when he left, by the firing of cannon from the arsenal.Doubtful, but not impossible. The report seems pretty well authenticated that France has acknowledged it. Great Britain will be slow to yield that point.       

 'ROMAN.' The N.H. Gazette, under the head. 'The Roman African,' is quite horrified to think that this 'noble African' should have 'been himself a dealer in slaves.' Does the Gazette know of any 'old Roman' in Tennessee that was ever 'a dealer in slaves,' on a large scale, buying and selling his own countrymen for gain?     

 THE BOUNDARY. The Woodstock (N.B.) Times of the 12th instant, informs us that Colonel Mudge and Mr. Featherstonhaugh have concluded their tour of exploration through the disputed territory, and have proceeded to Quebec. The party attached to the expedition have returned. Nothing has transpired, says, the Times, that can be fully depended on as to the result of their investigation; but adds as the rumor that no highlands corresponding to the terms of the treaty have been discovered, except at the source of the Penobscot, where they are said to be 'decidedly and distinctly marked.'     

 BEAT THIS! Among the extraordinary [ ] of the present year, we have neither seen nor heard of any which surpassed this which we are going to describe, viz. a Puff ball, five feet in circumference, 20 inchesin diameter, weight 13 1-2 pounds. This astonishing growth was accomplished in ten days from the time at first made its appearance. Plattsburgh, Greene Co. N.Y. has the honor of producing this vegetable [ ]. Our informant is S.A. Johnson, Esq., Post Master at that place, to whose office it was brought by Mr. Downs, one of our subscribers.    Puff ball, five feet in circumference, inches in diameter, weight  pounds.   

 IMPORTANT FROM TEXAS. The Houston Intelligencer of Sept. 19th, says:Gen. Anaya, of the Federal party in Mexico, who has spent the last eight or ten days in our city, will shortly make a visit to the United States. His preposition to enlist troops in Texas has been who We hope his journey to the United States may prove successful, as his object is to obtain persons to carry on a war against the Central party of his own country.       

 THE FLORIDA WAR. The Philadelphia National Gazette contains the following:We have information which states that seven thousand and regulars are to be sent to Florida, among them the eighth infantry and a large portion of the artillery, are to go from the northern frontier, and likewise the second regiment of dragoons. General Taylor has been authorized to send to Cuba for a large number of blood-hounds. (Horrible.)       

 Interesting Sight Race between a Deer and a Steam Engine. While the cars were coming down on Wednesday, a fine buck made his appearance on the track and had a trial of speed with the locomotive. He kept the track for two miles, when he was finally run off, or he would have been run over. The sight must have been deeply exciting and highly interesting as the line of road is perfectly straight, every inch of the contest was witnessed by the passengers Washington, N.C. Gazette.

 EPIDEMIC. An English paper says, that the epidemic which swept round the southern hemisphere this year, carried off, at the Cape of Good Hope, 5000 people. The horses also suffered, 75,000 having perished from inflammatory attacks. Farms which last year had 300 horses, have now but one. Besides all this, 3000 more of the farmers are emigrating towards the wilderness from this ill-fated colony.     

 SOUTHERN BAPTISTS. The Rev. Mr. Daniel, an aged Baptist minister of Mississippi, urges the establishment of southern Home Missionary Society, to 'take the charge of all the concerns south of the Potomac.' The reason given is found in 'our local situation, our climate, and clashing interest, and unequal stale currency, and population.
