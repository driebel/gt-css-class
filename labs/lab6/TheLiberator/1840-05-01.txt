 A JUVENILE PLEDGE. The Juvenile Emancipation Society, of Pawtucket, R.I. has pledged itself to raise twenty-five dollars towards defraying the expenses of our bro, ROGERS, of the Herald of Freedom, as a delegate to the World's Convention and also a similar amount to enable a worthy citizen of Pawtucket to go on the same mission. Nobly done, we say. ROGERS will be proud to represent the juvenile anti-slavery portion of Rhode-Island, as well as the adult abolitionists of New-Hampshire. Our friends are divided in opinion as to the expediency of his going to the Convention, in view of the peculiar state of the Anti-Slavery cause in the Granits State, and of the importance of his remaining at his post; still, much as he will be missed, we strongly incline to the opinion, that he should be sent to London.     

     NEW-YORK, 4th mo. 27, 1840.   FRIEND GARRISON:The Emancipator will be published hereafter, if at all, under the auspices of the New-York City Anti-Slavery Society. Its appearance this week, at any rate, is problematical. I send the following, therefore, for information, deeming it of some consequence that an early announcement of the change be made to those who may feel an interest in the subject.Respectfully,         JAMES. S. GIBBONS.      IN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, APRIL 2nd.   Resolved, That Mr. Leavitt's proposition to purchase the Emancipator be accepted, viz:'If the Committee will provide for its continuance to the close of the Vol. four (three) papers more, including my salary to the end of the current quarter, May 9th, and will then assign the list to me, I will undertake to supply those who have paid in advance with an anti-slavery paper to the amount of their subscription, and will make a donation to the Treasury of $100 out of my salary.'April 16th. Mr. Leavitt stated that he had no wish to avail himself of the agreement adopted at the last meeting respecting the Emancipator, should they (the Committee) wish to make a different disposal of it. The following preamble and resolution were then adopted:Whereas, The financial condition of the Society does not permit the continuance of the Emancipator in the hands of the Committee, or to reimburse subscribers who have paid in advance; and as it is desirable that the paper should be continued in this city;Resolved, That the Publishing Agent be authorized to sell the subscription books of the Emancipator to the Executive Committee of the New-York City Anti-Slavery Society, including the arrears due from subscribers, provided they will supply those who have paid in advance, amounting to about $1000 and will publish the paper, at least a year, under the charge of the present editor.J.S. Gibbons gave notice that he should enter a protest against the last vote.                  The Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society have voted to transfer the Emancipator to the New-York City Society, on the alleged ground that they can no longer provide the means necessary to sustain it.In the name of the AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY, I protest against this act of the Committee, for the following (among other) reasons:1. The Emancipator is not the property of the Executive Committee. It belongs to the American Society, which is constituted of the abolitionists of the country, who have sustained it through a long period of pecuniary embarrassment, and but for whose aid, it would have ceased to exist long ago. The aggregate excess of expenditure over all its receipts, since 1835, is more than Ten Thousand Dollars, which has been liquidated by the American Anti-Slavery Society, and not by its Executive Committee. The Committee, not being its real proprietors, have, therefore, no right to dispose of the Emancipator, by sale, transfer, or otherwise.2 The Emancipator is the official organ of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The Executive Committee were appointed (in part) to conduct that organ, as the official exponent and vindicator of its principles, as the guardian of its integrity, as the proper and accredited medium of correspondence with its constituents and auxiliaries. To remove that organ, is, literally, to destroy a part of its organization, to strike at the existence of the American Anti-Slavery Society, whose members never contemplated vesting a suicidal power in their Executive Committee, which they might wield at pleasure.3. The transfer is not necessary, on the alleged ground. A statement of the property of the Society shows a large balance over all its liabilities.4. Due respect to the feelings and opinions of the abolitionists generally, dictates the propriety of referring the final disposition of the Emancipator to the approaching annual meeting. A suspension of the publication would be preferable to its transfer, as it would not thereby be placed beyond the power of the Society to resume it; whereas, by the vote now passed, it is irrecoverable.These are some of the more important considerations which induce my dissent from the vote of the Committee.                 JAMES S. GIBBONS.     

             This may seen a hold assertion; but we make it very deliberately, We do not doubt that there is plenty of fight in the frontier inhabitants on both sides. We do not doubt that the Senator of Maine is very sincere in rubbing our ears and crying Tessem, boy! We do not doubt that all Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, and the principal men of both Canadas, are for the breaking of heads, and that Maine. New-Hampshire, Vermont Massachusetts, New-York, &c., are ditto; nor that the Pretension of Great Britain to claim, and to fact to occupy, a part of our territory, is palpably unjust; still, we are of opinion there will be no war. Why? Because our masters will not let us fight. They hold us in leashes somewhat tighter then they do the bloodhounds of Florida.But why should they object, since it is the free States which do nearly all the fighting, whatever and wherever the cause of the contest may be? The following reasons shall answer this question:They know very well that Great Britain would light up flames on the whole South western frontier; that she would sweep Texas with an allied army of English, Mexicans, and Indians, and from head quarters at New-Orleans, would proclaim freedom to two millions of democratic slaves, not to mention more. They know also that a West Indian army, composed in part of regiments of well disciplined and brave blacks, would land in Florida, furnish with arms, ammunition and provisions, the hostile Indians and negroes there, and with the accession of slaves, cooperate with the South western army, and with fleets, issuing from the British West Indies, Cuba and Vera Cruz. They know that such fleets and armies would contain many colored men from the United States, perfectly acquainted with the face of every part of the country, and with every creek, inlet and harbor; and what is worse, smarting under the wrongs, which have been inflicted upon them in the land of their birth. Materials of attack more destructive could not be imagined. And how would the soidisant 'chivalry' be employed? It would be driving a rusty spur into the ribs of a Rozinante, and switching its half-famished negroes into the back country to prevent their running away from their 'happy state,' and their 'affectionate masters,' to the enemy!In addition to this, the market of more than half of the whole southern cotton crop would be closed, and the article would fall so low that the other half would not be worth picking; while on the their hand the cultivation of it in India would receive an impulse, which would effectually prevent that market, closed by war, from being opened by peace.On the other hand, a war with England would give an unprecedented prosperity to northern manufacturers, wool-growers, graziers and farmers. Their surplus produce would be wanted for a numerous northern army, operating against forces embodied in the British provinces, and upon the territory which we should be fighting for. Our seamen would have employment in privateering. But this is not all. The north would be likely to gain territory. The malecontents of the Canadas would hail with joy our entrance into those provinces, and fly to join us. No doubt we should meet with reverse at first, but in the long run we should unquestionably gain territory. The proximity of our resources, without supposing any superiority in the field, would insure such a result.Now our government is a government of slaveholders, and has been so for more than forty years. Slavery has made war and peace for us, embargo and non-intercourses it has set up and pulled down protective and banking systems. It has even attempted to cede to Great Britain the very territory in dispute, thus lending color to a claim at first imaginary. And in his very last letter, in reply to the peppery communication of the British minister, Mr. Forsyth, a slaveholder, intimates that this government will consent to 'a new boundary,' if the State of Maine can be brought to acquiesce. The consent of Massachusetts, who owns two out of every three acres of the land, is of no consequence. This is the respect of a 'State rights' party' for State rights!An agreement was actually concluded, signed and sealed, betwixt Gen. Jackson and the agents of Maine, Mr. Preble and one or two more, that the territory of Maine, claimed by Great Britain, should be surrendered, and that Maine should receive an equivalent in the State of Michigan. Massachusetts was not consulted, and never knew of it, until Mr. Kent came to be governor of Maine, and found this fine arrangement in the executive pigeon-holes! Now, Gen. Jackson knew that the disinterested and unspoiled majority of his own party in the State of Maine would never consent to this, yet he resorted to it. Why? To gain time to stave off a question, which, if brought to an issue and trial, would ruin his party at one end of the Union or the other. The administration is now harder pressed by the same question than ever, with less ability of every kind to meet it, and they are trying to humbug Great Britain by holding out the same stale and false pretence that Maine may consent to 'a new boundary.' What means that, but yielding the territory? Will What means that, but yielding the territory? Will Maine do that? Never and the President knows it.And with such prospects staring them in the face, will our far-sighted Southern 'brethren,' whose principal study it has been, ever since the foundation of the government, and now is, to check the growth of the North, permit us to fight? Credat Judoeus, non ego.There is but one chance of our having a brush, and that is the chance that the slaveholders may lose the loyal States of Maine and New-Hampshire. No doubt there is great danger, that to barter a part of the State of Maine to purchase peace and safety for an institution, for which 'there can be no peace,' would appear to the honest majority of the Northern friends of the administration a leetle too much. The office-holders, and office-seekers, whose little system of frauds and falsehood serves so well for ordinary occasions, would be totally inadequate to an emergency like this. The filth of our streets is sometimes swept into the dock by a strong northeaster.What, then, will the administration ('the northern man with southern principles') do to avoid the loss of black slaves in the South west? or of the deceived portion of white slaves in the Northeast? He will continue to do as he and his predecessor have done stave off the question. He will do like a criminal, who is sure of being convicted, if he come to trial get a continuance. For what have they done during the ten years of the administration of our step-father and his predecessor an administration which was 'to ask nothing but what was right, and to submit to nothing wrong'? They have been driving a two-penny claim, to be indemnified for an act of God, by which two or three score of southern 'chattels' were converted into men! This has been the great employment of years of the diplomacy of a southern Secretary of State, and a southern Plenipotentiary at St. James! Meantime, this great question of a disputed boundary between two powerful nations has been open and yawning to engulf the whole frontiers, and to shake into runs God only knows how much more!  Tessem boy                 Credat Judoeus, non ego.       HAMILTON.      

 ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. It must be understood, once for all, that we do not hold ourselves responsible for any sentiments that may be advanced by any of our correspondents, any further than we choose to express our editorial approbation of them. There are a few points in the reply of our bro. Goodell to Mr. Child, which we feel disposed to notice; but we shall leave the discussion in their hands, trusting it will not be protracted in our columns beyond reasonable bounds. 'A Plain Man' is mistaken in supposing Mr. Goodell is a Presbyterian; and if he were, it is not in accordance with anti-slavery usages for one abolitionist to speak invidiously of another on account of his religious sentiments.     

         We confess that, considering the notes of preparation, and the somewhat confident bearing of the principal movers of the convention for some weeks before the meeting, we were a little disappointed on finding so meagre a roll of its members as the minutes disclose. Meagre, we mean, in numbers, when compared with some of our state, and even county conventions of abolitionists, It is true that the roads were in a bad state for travelling, but this by no means accounts for the non-attendance of the swarms of abolitionists in New-York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut Rhode Island and Massachusetts, who had only to step on board a steam-boat, or drop into a rail-car, to find a cheap and rapid conveyance to Albany. Why was Pennsylvania not represented in the convention? Why only one from Connecticut and one from Maine? Why only two from Vermont, who furnished a phalanx of 33 at the national convention in August? Why only a handful from the city of New-York, and here and there a man from the bold ranks of the Hudson? Why so few from the county of Oneida, the 'infected district' of New-York abolitionism, and where the third party project has undergone the most ample discussion? There is but one answer to all these questions, and that is, the great mass of abolitionists were unprepared to enter upon the bold experiment of independent nominations at this juncture, and therefore they remained at home. It appears, too, that of those in attendance, a majority of eleven only was found, after two days' discussion, to be favorable to a third party or, what we conceive to be substantially the same thing, independent candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency.It is presumed that the most strenuous advocates of the third party project would be disposed to admit that the time has been, and that not remote, when the idea of a distinct political organization of abolitionists, as such, would have been justly regarded as premature, not to say visionary. The National Convention of last August, numbering five hundred staunch friends of the slave, after ample deliberation, almost unanimously declared against such an organization, though we admit that most of the opposition to the measure was predicated on considerations of expediency only. We so treated the question in that Convention, and voted with the majority. The action of that Convention was subsequently approved of by most of the State anti-slavery societies, and by numerous bodies of abolitionists in minor meetings, Our opinion, individually, is unchanged. After a careful survey of the whole ground, we are persuaded that our cause would, on the whole, be weakened by intestine divisions, far more than it would gain by an attempt, however zealously pushed, at this juncture, to organize a third political party. We believe this to be the view taken by a majority, if not by every member of our state Executive Committee. We do not hesitate to advance it as our best judgment, that a vast majority of the abolitionists of Vermont are of the same opinion.      

 The proceedings of the Norfolk and Middlesex County Societies we shall endeavor to publish in our next number. Those of the Bristol' County Society have not yet been received. We hope they have not experienced the fate of the proceedings of a former meeting, which were Inst.     

 The number of free schools in South Carolina is 832, containing 8867 pupils. Expenses, $40,326. A few parishes not heard from.     

       Some of the political papers are circulating the statement, with much apparent gratification, that the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society has ceased to exist; and even our bro. Myrick, of the Cazenovia Herald, says that it learns from the Liberator, that the Society was dissolved by a vote of 143 to 10! Where were our bro, M's eyes, that he did not see, in the same number of our paper, a Protest against the extraordinary and unconstitutional manner in which this nominal dissolution was effected, and announcing that the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society was still in the field, strong and undaunted, and redeemed from the foul spirits of new organization and sectarianism, which have prevented its free action for some time past? We call upon our bro. M. to give the other side of the story in his columns; and to announce to the country, that the Society is 'in the full tide of successful experiment.' It will receive, moreover, the countenance and aid of the great body of anti-slavery women in Massachusetts.    

              IN THE SENATE, March , 1840.   The Resolves in relation to the right of petition came up for consideration.Mr. N. WOOD, of Worcester, opposed their adoption. He said that Congress had by the Constitution a right to adopt their own rules, and that, in refusing to receive petitions, they did not contravene that clause of the constitution which provided that Congress shall pass no law abridging the right of the people to petition. He also objected to the term 'petition,' as addressed to the servants of the people in Congress; he thought the word ought not to be used by the citizens of a free republic in making their wants known to Congress.Mr. DAVIS, of Franklin, said that the gentleman from Worcester seemed to have more regard for the letter than the spirit of the Constitution. The result of that gentleman's doctrines was, that Congress might do any thing they chose, or exercise unlimited power over the persons and fortunes of individuals, by simply calling the law, under which the power was exercised, a 'rule.' What would the gentleman say of a 'rule' that any member of Congress who opposed or advocated the sub-treasury project, should suffer death? Would not this be a stretch of the authority given them by the clause in question?(Mr. WOOD here disclaimed carrying the doctrine to this extent.)Mr. DAVIS resumed. He did not believe that under any fair construction of the clause empowering Congress to establish rules for the regulation and proper consideration of their business, they had a right to make rules to exclude and prevent the consideration of any subject. Nor did he believe that the framers of the Constitution would have stultified themselves by providing so carefully that the right to petition should not be abridged, unless they had considered that the term right of petition included and implied the right to be heard. Why was the right of petition sacred, but that an avenue might be kept open to the reasons and consciences of the majority? What is the right worth, if we are shut out from the means by which it is to be made effective? and if we are thus shut out, who can doubt that the right is in every essential particular abridged?But the gentleman from Worcester had deemed it necessary to fortify his argument on this point by cavilling at the terms of the Constitution, and by insisting that its framers provided for the right of petition without due consideration of the import of the terms. The gentleman says, that it is absurd for the people, the masters, to petition their servants, the members of Congress. Sir, said Mr. D., this objection is not new to me, though I had hoped never to hear it sanctioned by a New England man. It is not of New England origin or affinities. 'The hands are the hands of Esau; but the voice is the voice of Jacob.' The lips which now utter the sophistry are the lips of the gentleman from Worcester; but the sophistry itself was first publicly promulgated in the Senate of the United States, by a distinguished statesman of South Carolina. The fallacy lies in the mistaken use of terms. It is true that members of Congress are the servants of the people; but petitions, from the nature of the case, must always come from minorities; and although in form presented to Congress, yet in fact they are presented to the consideration of the majority of the people, of which majority Congress is but the servant and agent. The superiority of physical strength, and consequently the controlling power, is with the majority; and petition and argument are the appropriate and only means by which a minority can promote those objects which it esteems desirable. In this point of view, the anxiety exhibited by the framers of the Constitution to secure the right of petition unabridged, has great and peculiar significance; and there is an equal significance in the attempt now making to break it down, and to secure to the hardened will of an infuriated, selfish, or indifferent majority, an entire immunity from harassing appeals to the reason or conscience of its constituent individuals.Mr. D. then referred to the language of the Resolves, which, though strong and indignant, was for that very reason perfectly suited to the occasion. Not merely the petitions of citizens of this and other States had been treated with contempt, but the Resolves of this Commonwealth upon a subject on which she had a right to speak, and couched in no other language than that of honesty, honor, and truth, were rejected from the doors of the Capitol, and treated as the haughtiest despot would treat the vilest and most despised thing. Whether as a colony or a commonwealth, she had never been backward to assert her own rights, or to express her hatred of wrong and her sympathy with the oppressed, and he trusted that it could never be said of the present generation at least that they had fallen away from the faith, the courage or the principles of their fathers.                 IN THE SENATE, March , 1840.   The resolves relating to slavery and the slave-trade &c. coming up for considerationMr. WILLARD of Middlesex moved to amend the first resolve, by striking out the word 'immediate,' from before the word 'suppression,' so that the resolve, if amended, would read, 'That Congress ought to exercise its acknowledged power, in the suppression of slavery and the slave-trade in the District of Columbia.'Mr. DAVIS of Franklin opposed the amendment, and called for the yeas and nays thereon, which were accordingly ordered. The amendment prevailed. The question then being on the passage of the resolvesMr. N. WOOD of Worcester spoke at some length, and with much violence, against all the resolves. He said that they were intended as an attack upon the southern States, and an attempt to break down an institution which our fathers had agreed to consider [ ]' from intrusion or attack on our part. He spoke of the anti-slavery effort as a 'miserable fanaticism.' He said that what could not be done fairly, was proposed to be done in a 'hypocritical, pharisaical way.'As it regarded abolition in the District, he considered it would be no less than taking away property by force. We had heretofore called it property, and if Congress undertook now to take it away, 'it would be mean'; particularly, as not a word is said about compensation.Besides, he was opposed to this resolve, because, if slavery was abolished in the District, it would almost necessarily bring about abolition in Maryland and Virginia; which would be a mean return for their generosity in bestowing the District on the Union. This course would be as wrong as it would be for my neighbor to put up on his premises a nuisance which would ruin the whole of my farm. Maryland and Virginia never would have ceded the District, if they had known that such a use was to be made of it.Then as to the resolve calling upon Congress to interdict the domestic slave-trade, he knew that some of the fanatics had said that this could be done: but he was confident that this Legislature would never sanction such an idea. And as to prescribing whether a State should or should not be allowed to come in to the Union with the institution of slavery, he considered it mean and dishonorable thus to interfere with the domestic concerns of any State, and he thought we might as well stipulate that no ardent spirits should be drunk, no cattle introduced, no tight-lacing allowed.After Mr. WOOD had concluded. it being near the usual hour of adjournment. a motion was made to lay the orders of the day on the table, which motion was rejected.Mr. HUBBARD of Suffolk then moved to lay these resolves on the table, which motion prevailed by a small majority; and the Senate shortly after adjourned.In the course of the ensuing afternoon and morning, a number of ineffectual attempts were made to have the resolves taken up for consideration. There was an evident intention on the part of some members of the Board, to stifle or postpone the question. At about one o'clock.Mr. DAVIS, of Franklin, obtained the floor, and moved that the resolves upon slavery, &c. which had yesterday been laid upon the table, be now taken up for consideration. He also said that he felt compelled to meet the evident disposition for postponement or evasion which had been exhibited, by calling for the yeas and nays on the question of taking the resolves from the table, and by availing himself, however irregularly, of this occasion, to speak to their general merits. He had abstained from pressing them, heretofore, in any manner which might wear the appearance of undue urgency, and thus tend to excite a prejudice against them. He had not asked that they should be taken up out of their order, but had waited patiently until every subject which preceded them in the orders of the day, however local or insignificant, whether relating to the measure of indian meal and cracked corn, or to the still more important mysteries of the preparation of clam-bait, had been regularly disposed of. He now demanded that they should be acted upon, and should consider a vote to postpone as equivalent to a vote to reject, and so would it be considered by the people. He was still more astonished that there should be any disposition to delay the discussion, after the speech of the gentleman from Worcester (Mr. N. WOOD,) a speech so monstrous in its doctrines, so opposed to the feelings and principles which Massachusetts has always cherished, so false to the voice of conscience, and the instincts of liberty, that he should have supposed that every other member of that Board would have felt impelled to visit it forthwith with the strongest terms of reprobation. For one, he would avail himself of the opportunity now for the first time allowed, to repel the charges brought by the gentleman from Worcester against the petitioners at whose instance these Resolves had been introduced, and to expose the sophistry by which that gentleman had attempted to defeat the action which the resolves contemplated.The first of the resolves declared the power and duty of Congress to abolish slavery and the slave trade in the District. The second called for the immediate prohibition of the slave trade between the States. The third protested against the admission into the Union of any State whose Constitution should tolerate domestic slavery. The objects thus definitely stated are of the highest importance, and are strictly within the power of Congress; and under these circumstances, the gentleman from Worcester has chosen to designate this attempt to obtain an object confessedly desirable, and within our power, as a 'mean' and 'pharisaical' plot to obtain another object about which not a word is said in the resolves, and which is universally admitted not to be within the power of Congress that is to say, the abolition of slavery within the States where it now exists. If the argument of the gentleman amounts to any thing, it is that we ought not to do what is right and just, and in our power, because, after doing it, we may possibly be requested to go farther and do something which is not within our legislative power. We are to make sure of neglecting our evident duty, and of doing wrong now, to avoid the risk of being requested to do wrong hereafter. The argument, if it be one, will not bear to be stated. It perishes in the utterance. Perhaps, however, the gentleman means to be understood that the petitioners, while asking in terms for the abolition of slavery in the District, are principally anxious to secure the moral influence which such an act would develope against the institution as it exists in the States. But the gentleman from Worcester has failed to show that the good influence which flows from the performance of a righteous act, constitutes in every respect a reason why the act should not be performed. If the gentleman's theory is correct, Massachusetts ought not to have abolished slavery within her own limits, because of the disturbing moral influence thus exerted on the South the county of Bristol, in prohibiting the sale of ardent spirits, exercised an impertinent and unwarrantable moral influence over the county of Worcester and every man ought to hesitate how he goes to church or pays a debt, lest he should be found guilty, by the disciples of this new doctrine, of the unpardonable wickedness of having set a good example. Mr. D. denied, therefore, that in advocating these resolves, he was unconstitutionally of unfairly attacking the Southern States; the resolves refer to a locality and to practices for which Massachusetts is equally responsible with Mississippi, and in reference to which it is her equal right and duty to speak and act. To the charge of the gentleman from Worcester, that the desire of the petitioners to extend liberty to all whom our votes or our constitutional powers can reach, is a miserable fanaticism, Mr. D. would not waste time in replying. As soon would he make a labored argument to prove to this Senate that the blood shed in our revolutionary struggle was well expended, or that the doctrines of the Declaration of Independence were something more than a 'rhetorical flourish.'But the gentleman from Worcester further insists that our regard for the rights of property should prevent us from abolishing slavery in the District; and this regard for the right of property the gentleman relies on for the defence of an institution which is based in entire disregard of the original and inalienable right of property, which every man has in himself, and in the fruits of his own labor. He bows down to whips and manacles as symbols of property, with a reverence which he will not pay to the image of God. He manifests that 'superstition of legality,' as it has been well called, which pays respect to forms without regard to rights. If this doctrine had prevailed five hundred years ago, his ancestors and mine never could have emerged from the condition of serfs. Five centuries ago, the leading truths of our Declaration of Independence were proclaimed by the serfs and villeins of England; and the Norman slaveholders of that day put in the same plea that is now put in by the gentleman from Worcester. When called upon by the King (in 1381) to say whether they would subscribe charters of enfranchisement, 'God preserve us,' answered the barons and chevaliers, 'from subscribing to such charters, though we should all perish in one day; for we would rather lose our lives than our inheritance.' In the progress of time, the instinct of liberty prevailed against the selfishness of tyranny, and raised up the ignorant and degraded serf into the brave, intelligent, free Anglo-Saxon. We, of all races in the world, should be the last to dispute the importance or the truth of the principle which has made us what we are.But the gentleman says, that any interference by Congress between master and slave would be mean. What a singular perversion of language! How perverted is the sympathy which thinks only of the possible inconvenience of the master, and not at all of the absolute privations of the slave. His sympathy is for the strong, not for the fallen; his bowels yearn not for the victim, but for the oppressor; 'he is moved to tears lest Rapine should lick dry, and parched, and bloodless jaws.' 'Mean!' Which is meaner to hold men in slavery, or to devise means for making them free? The gentleman calls compulsory emancipation in the District 'mean'; I call compulsory slavery in the District 'mean'; mean beyond all power of expression, and up to the utmost verge of conception. The plausibilities of language and conventionalities of society cannot change the nature of the thing. If I should compel a laboring man to work for me, and should withhold from him a full compensation for his labor, would not the gentleman from Worcester with reason say, that my conduct was mean and despicable? and how can such conduct be disguised, or its real character changed, by numbers participating in the act, and investing it with the name of an 'institution?' I have none but friendly feelings for the gentleman from Worcester. I hope that his life will be a prosperous and happy one; but I cannot but think that some temporary experience of the miseries of a state of slavery would work an entire change in his views of this subject. Exchange his broadcloth coat and fine linen for the coarse and scanty attire of the slave set him to labor under the lash in a broiling sun put him under laws which leave his wife or daughter entirely at the mercy of a brutal master, and under which his children or himself may at any time be sold in public market and dragged away to a far distant region, and to labor in the sugar mill or rice-field, more destructive to human life than ever was Borodino or Waterloo deprive him of the right to acquire or hold property, of the privileges of education, of facilities for religious instruction, of every thing, in a word, which embellishes or dignifies the life of man let him know at the same time that the inhabitants of twenty-six sovereign States, through their representatives in Congress, have made and can at their will unmake the laws through which this stupendous iniquity is perpetrated and, my word for it, he would not be disposed to apply any disparaging epithet to my conduct, or that of any other legislator who should raise his voice and direct his efforts against the further continuance of the wrong.But the gentleman says that to abolish slavery in the District, without the assent of Maryland and Virginia, would be a violation of the implied terms of the cession. Even if there were evidence of such implied understanding, it ought not to avail against the express terms of the grant, by which those states relinquished to Congress exclusive jurisdiction over the district in all cases whatever. He says that these States would not have made the cession, had they supposed that such a use would have been made of the grant. But does he suppose that the Union would have received the grant, if coupled with any such limitation? The fact is, that there is abundant evidence to the point, that not only was there no implied understanding, limiting the exercise of the power of Congress over the District, but there was a general understanding and expectation that slavery, both in the District and in the adjoining States, would cease at a period long before this; and if any implicit agreement has been broken, it has been broken by the inhabitants of the District and of the States from which it was carved.Mr. DAVIS went on to reply to Mr. Wood's remarks in respect to the domestic slave trade, and to notice the parallel drawn by that gentleman between a prohibition of the institution of slavery, and a prohibition of the practice of tight lacing. But we are obliged to omit this part of his remarks for want of room. After he resumed his seat, the question was taken on taking the resolves from the table, and determined in the affirmative by a large majority.In the afternoon, Mr. DAVIS moved a re-consideration of the vote by which the Senate had amended by striking out the word 'immediate' from the first resolve. After some debate, that vote was reconsidered.Mr. HUBBARD, of Suffolk, then proposed to amend by inserting the words 'means for the' between the word 'immediate' and the word 'means.'Mr. SAVAGE, of Suffolk, advocated the amendment. He was in favor of emancipation, but thought time should be given for preparation, and that it would be dangerous to manumit the slaves at once, and quoted with commendation the mode of emancipation in the West Indies adopted by the English government. He also said the masters should be compensated.Mr. DAVIS said he was happy to hear the history of emancipation in the British West Indies referred to by the gentleman from Suffolk; for that history disproved all the points taken by that gentleman, and presented the best and most recent evidence of the wisdom and safety of immediate and entire emancipation. The apprenticeship system, which was a species of gradualism, had worked ill, and was finally exchanged for immediate emancipation, with the full assent of the planters. As to the question of compensation, that question was not touched one way or the other by the resolves, and it was unnecessary now to discuss it. The result of the experiment in the West Indies had shown, however, that when emancipation took place, the value of the slaves was transferred to that of the soil, and there was no actual loss of wealth. Whenever the question of compensation should come up, he did not doubt that it could be settled on equitable terms.                                           

 INTERESTING PAMPHLET. We are indebted to an English friend for a copy of a pamphlet, entitled 'Society of Friends in the United States: their views on the anti-slavery question, and treatment of the people of color Compiled from original correspondence.' This pamphlet was printed at Darlington, England, and is principally made up of letters from WILLIAM BASSETT of Lynn, whose testimony against the lukewarmness of the Society with which he is connected, in the cause of emancipation, and the prejudice which it cherishes in common with other sects against a colored complexion, is very faithfully and excellently expressed. He says'It is not without a struggle with a naturally ease-seeking disposition, that I have brought my mind to speak plainly of such things as I conceive to be wrong in the Society of which I am a member, and which, in days that are past, I have fondly hoped would shine forth with increased brightness, as a beacon to the world; but, I have felt myself impelled by my love for its best interests, and still more by an apprehension of duty to the cause of truth, to interpose my feeble influence against the current which threatens to overwhelm our Society, and make it a hissing and a bye-word among the people.'This pamphlet, we think, cannot fail to make some excitement among Friends on both sides of the Atlantic. It uses 'plain language,' which, of course, they cannot object to, and exposes the inconsistencies of the Society in a very forcible manner. Faithful are the wounds of 'A FRIEND.'         

 We believe the servitude which prevails in the South far preferable to that of the North, or in Europe. Slavery will exist in all communities. There is a class which may be nominally free, but they will be virtually slaves.' Mississippian, July 5, 1838.A laboring people, 'bleached or unbleached,' are a dangerous element of the body politic. 'Slavery is the corner stone of our republican edifice.' Gov. McDuffie's Message, 1835.        

 THE ALEANY CONVENUION. This Convention is conceded on all hands, (new organization aside,) to have been an abortion. The nomination of Messrs. Birney and Earle gets no support from the anti-slavery presses. We hope these gentlemen are not resolved to be made permanently ridiculous, by consenting to stand as candidates; and we are looking, with considerable confidence, for letters from them, declining the nomination. In a letter to the editor of the Maine Advocate of Freedom, Mr. Codding, who was present at Albany, and voted in the affirmative, says 'The Convention did not seem to confer with flesh and blood.' However this may be, it certainly took no counsel of good sense or sound discretion!     

            UTICA, April 6, 1840.    TO DAVID LEE CHILD:SIR Your letter of March 21 reaches me through the Liberator of March 27. You take exceptions, it seems, to my remarks in the Friend of Man, of 11th of March, in which I allude to your attendance of a whig meeting at Northampton, and making a speech understood to be in favor of the election of Gen. Harrison. My remarks, you think, were 'unjust' to yourself, and 'calculated to be prejudicial to our anti-slavery cause.' You proceed to intimate that I might as well arraign you, as an abolitionist, for having attended any 'municipal, parochial, legislative, ecclesiastical, agricultural, missionary or benevolent' assemblage, of any description.In reply to this, I would say, in the first place, that my remarks were not elicited, because of your attendance, simply, at the whig meeting, nor because of your taking a part in the proceedings, as a whig, but because I understood that the part you took at that meeting was in support of a pro-slavery candidate for the Presidency, and of a slaveholding candidate for the Vice Presidency of the United States. If at a 'municipal' meeting, you had advocated the re-election of a notorious slave-catcher, like the late Recorder Riker of New York, or Constable Nash if at a 'parochial' meeting you had made a speech calculated to introduce a slaveholding preacher into the pulpit if, in a legislative hall, your acts had ill accorded with your anti-slavery professions if, in any other association, 'ecclesiastical, agricultural, missionary, benevolent, or what not' your influence should have been given in support of slavery instead of freedom, I suppose the common usages among abolitionists would bear me out in saying publicly, that your course was inconsistent, and 'prejudicial to our anti-slavery cause.' And I cannot see what there is so sacred in a whig meeting, that your acts in such a convocation should not be as open to the public scrutiny of the anti-slavery press, as they doubtless would be in a missionary or other benevolent meeting. Nor can I see why the support of a slaveholding or pro-slavery preacher, or judge, or constable, should be more reprehensible, in an abolitionist, than the support of a slaveholding or pro-slavery President or Vice President of the United States.Indeed, a glance at your paragraph from which I have just quoted, awakens in me the suspicion that I might have taken, without great injustice, a much higher ground than the one I assumed. I notice that you did not include the Colonization Society among the associations which an abolitionist might approvingly attend, as a member, without justly rendering the genuineness of his abolitionism 'suspect.' Should I ask you why the Colonization Society should not have been thus included, I can readily anticipate your answer. You would doubtless say that the Colonization Society, notwithstanding the moral excellencies of some of its members, and notwithstanding their good intentions in supporting it, is nevertheless, in its leading influences and tendencies and policy, a pro-slavery organization. You would say that it holds one face at the South, and another at the North, that its President, (if not its Vice President) is a slaveholder. Above all, you would indignantly advert to its arrogant pretensions of being the true remedy for slavery, and to its consequent attempts to divert abolitionists from their strait-forward course, and to lead them to trust in its efficacy and fidelity to accomplish all they could desire. And of such an organization you would probably allege, that no abolitionist ought to give it his countenance by attending its meetings as a member. Now, Sir, I will not at the present time impose on you the difficult task of pointing out the broad line of distinction between the Colonization Society, (in the particulars I have mentioned,) and the whig party, taken as a whole. But I think I need only wait till a few more leading whigs, such as Seth M. Gates, and Lt. Gov. Camp, and their echoes, shall have urged upon us the support of the whig party in lieu of all other political action against slavery; and one part, at least, of the parallel will have become sufficiently complete. Those who heard the argument of Dr. Beman, at the Albany Convention, against nominating a President, will not doubt that the support of the whig party is the abolition measure that lies uppermost in many minds. So that unless it be a fact, that the support of the whig party is the support of abolition, it will become just as true that whig efforts and abolition efforts are, in the nature of the case, antagonisms, as it is that colonization efforts and abolition efforts are thus rival and opposite interests. And the so called, but misnamed 'democratic' party, if I mistake not, though it does not insult us by pretending to be the political remedy of slavery, is in a fair way to win the reputation of being a thorough-going pro-slavery organization, to which no consistent abolitionist should permit himself to belong. To this latter proposition, I think I shall readily gain your assent.But waiving all this, (which was not in my mind when I wrote the article to which you allude,) I must beg leave to insist that whenever an abolitionist permits himself to subserve the interests of his party, by voting or seeking to procure votes for a pro-slavery law-maker or chief magistrate, he is unfaithful to his professions as an abolitionist. In support of this sentiment, let me quote a resolution of the late annual meeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, to which you belong.'Resolved, That any man calling himself an abolitionist, who refuses, when at the polls, to cast his vote for an advocate of immediate emancipation, is unworthy the name he claims, and proves himself to be more devoted to the paltry ends of party, than to the great interests of freedom and humanity.'It was this principle, Sir, that I acted upon, when I wrote the article in question. If I mistook the main facts of the case, I shall be happy to make due reparation for the injustice I have done you. But if not, then I conceive it to be my duty, and consequently my right, to reiterate and apply the sentiment of the above resolution to the case in hand, that I may bear testimony against the wrongs inflicted by such political action, upon my brethren in bonds. Should I neglect to do this, through the fear of being accounted denunciatory, censorious and exclusive, I should not know how to pen or utter any more reproofs against southern statesmen and citizens for doing the same thing.You say it was my duty to have inquired about your speech before I impeached you. I thought it was sufficient to know that it was emphatically a Harrison and Tyler meeting, and that your name was included among the speakers whose efforts were acceptable to an Editor bent on the elevation of those candidates. But I examine your letter to see whether I was mistaken in my impressions received through the whig editor.It is plain, I think, from your own statement, that you exerted yourself to make a strong impression against the present administration of the national government; and you do not deny, but rather lead the reader to infer, that you intended to charge the support of slavery, emphatically, upon your political opponents, and thus to imply strongly that the change proposed to be made by the whig meeting was a change in respect to the slave-sustaining policy of the country a change in favor of abolition and human rights. You say, indeed, 'I stated that I had my objections to Gen. Harrison, but I did not say that I should or should not vote for him, for the very good reason that I did not know.' But I do not learn from this statement in your letter to me, that you gave the meeting to understand that you had any doubts how you should vote. And I put it to your candor to say, whether I now misunderstand you? and whether it was not your intention, at the meeting, to make the impression that, notwithstanding your objections to Gen. Harrison, your influence was to be expected in his favor, and in accordance with the objects of the meeting? If you shall distinctly inform me that I err in understanding that these were the facts, then I shall hasten to retract what I have written. But until then, I must still understand you as having supported Gen. Harrison at the whig meeting. And that support, if I understand the matter, was so much the stronger for your having stated that you had objections, and yet having it to be fairly inferred that you waived them, and acquiesced in the sentiments of the meeting.But why did you not know whether you should vote for Gen. Harrison? Your letter furnishes me with two answers to this question.1. You say, 'When we shall have received a full expression of his present views of slavery, and of his intentions, should he be called as President of the United States, to act in relation to it, I shall decide for myself, whether to vote for him or not.' This leaves me to infer that if you are satisfied with Gen. Harrison, you will vote for the Harrison ticket, although, in so doing, you must vote for the slaveholder. Tyler, a Lynch law opponent of abolition. Am I wrong in this conclusion? Let me know it, and I will hasten to 'cancel the record.' And let me here ask you one question. What would you think of an abolitionist, who must first wait to know the 'present views' of Mr. Van Buren, before he could decide whether he could vote for him? I have never yet found a whig abolitionist, who would not pour contempt upon the abolitionism of the man who could hesitate whether or no he should vote for Mr. Van Buren. In this, I think the whig abolitionists are right. But what do we know of the 'present views' of Mr. Van Buren? The date of his celebrated veto pledge is not much more recent than that of the Vincennes speech of Gen. Harrison, in which he denied our Constitutional right even to discuss the Slave question! And we note have Gen. Harrison's full endorsement of that speech, up to the present year, 1840. We have the testimony of Southern Van Buren editors, that this endorsement is satisfactory, and that, on the score of abolition, Mr. Van Buren is not more safe, to the South, than Gen. Harrison. To these facts add the 4th of July speech, 1838, of Gen. Harrison, at Cheviot, Ohio, in which he said, 'The SCHEMES of ABOLITIONISTS are fraught with HORRORS, upon which an INCARNATE DEVIL only could look with approbation.' Remember his support of slavery in Indiana, in 1804 and at the Missouri Compromise, of 1820. Connect all this with the Declaration of the Cincinnati Committee, not long since, when answering inquiries, on Gen. Harrison's behalf, that 'the General's views, in regard to all the important and exciting questions of the day, have HERETOFORE been given to the public, fully and explicitly, and that those views, whether connected with constitutional or other questions of very general interest, have undergone NO CHANGE.' Then tell me, Sir, if you can, what further exhibition or expression of his 'present views' can be needed, in order to determine whether an abolitionist can vote for Gen. Harrison. As some of these developments are quite recent, let me hope that, while I am writing, your knowledge of the 'present views' of Gen. Harrison will have determined you to declare publicly, that you cannot vote for him. I am persuaded you will do this, unless the second reason for your hesitancy, as stated in your letter, shall continue to have weight with you, viz:2. You say, 'Although I look upon the abolition of slavery as superior to any one interest of the country, I do not regard it as more important than all other interests, and I claim the absolute right of weighing and balancing the various considerations which may seem to me proper to enter into the determination of my vote.'Undoubtedly, Sir, you have the right you have claimed, and so have the citizens and statesmen of the South, when, after 'weighing and balancing all the considerations,' &c. &c. they determine, (as the North and the South have, thus far, united in doing) that the abolition of slavery is not as important as 'all other interests' which should 'enter into the determination of (their) votes.' You have this right- but be pleased to remember that I too have the night to say that such a decision, together with the principles you have assumed as its basis, is as far removed from genuine abolitionism, as the practice of the nation for the last sixty years is removed from the sentiments of the Anti-Slavery Declaration of 1833. I need not remind you, Sir, that the 'various considerations' you have urged are precisely the same in nature and character as those that have prevented the abolition of slavery in all nations and ages, 'We are all opposed to slavery in the abstract.' That is we should gladly assent to its abolition, were it not for 'the various considerations which enter into the determination of our votes.' Abolitionists, until recently, have been so 'fanatical' and 'reckless of consequences' as to demand immediate abolition, without 'regard to all other interests' supposed to be involved. And they have been so 'denunciatory and unchristian' as to declare all the 'various considerations' urged against it, are nothing distinct from the temptations of the Devil for no man commits sin without a supposed balance of interests in favor of sinning. Yet, Sir, in continuation of the sentence just quoted, you have thought proper to add.'I have not thrown off the fetters of political party to come under the surveillance of an Anti-Slavery Society. These attempts to interfere with the free political action of abolitionists, savor too much of the usurping and exclusive spirit of party, and of the drumming up and drilling which selfish leaders employ in mustering and training the rank and file.You seem, Sir, to have drawn a picture of party tactics and enslavement quite familiar to your own mind, and I cannot wonder that if you have thrown off such fetters, you should instinctively revolt at the thought of again wearing them. Imagination, methinks, must have pursued your sleeping moments with the fear of being 'drilled' by 'selfish leaders' into the 'rank and file' where slaveholders and their apologists are the file leaders. Let me cherish the hope that you will soon learn (if you have thrown off the fetters of political party) the distinction between the 'attempts to interfere,' which consist in the array of 'various considerations' in opposition to the voice of conscience and 'the drumming up and drilling' which Conscience herself, led on by Truth, never fails to inflict on those whose method of 'weighing and balancing' does not accord with her dictates. The South complains loudly of our attempts to interfere' but when Truth, Righteousness and Mercy impel us to 'interfere' woe to us if we give not utterance to their admonitions. When 'the surveillance of Anti-Slavery Society' shall be used to urge men to vote for their nominated candidates, against the conscientious convictions of the free voter that the candidates are unworthy, (as the political parties are now doing,) I hope to be among the foremost to resist their encroachments. On this subject, my testimony is already on record. But if the Anti-Slavery Society is guilty of no greater or other despotism than that of classing the pro-slavery voters of the North (however lofty their abolition professions) with the less enlightened and therefore less guilty pro-slavery voters of the South, it must be an eloquent appeal that rouses me to the complainings of those who may writhe under their inflictions, however painful and scorching. I know, indeed, that the strokes of Truth and Conscience are most unendurable. Give me the place of the voter for Pharaoh, who perished with him in the Red Sea give me the still deeper doom of the Southern slavocrat who sustains a M'Duffie or a Calhoun nay, give me the still lower infamy of the northern dough-face who stoops to support Atherton gage but delivery me, in Heaven's mercy deliver me from the portion of the professed abolitionist of old Massachusetts, the Champion of the 'Old pioneer New-England Society,' who, in a day like the present, and amid the lightnings that are rousing the world's attention, can consent, for any earthly 'considerations, to cast his vote for either Harrison or Van Buren. The higher the elevation, the more dreadful the fall.What avails it to boast of the intelligence and conscientiousness of abolitionists, when they have not made up their minds whether they shall vote for a slaveholding Vice President? And what are we to understand by the clam security which 'entertains no fears that the genuine abolition sentiment (?) of the country will not find a way to utter itself, and be felt in the elections?' You intimate that my anxiety on this point betrays a fear that abolitionists cannot take care of themselves! You might as well add, that the anxiety of abolitionists lest the people of the non-slaveholding States, (who commonly profess to be abolitionists) should fall under the weight of divine judgments, for sustaining the slave system, betrays equally the same fear and distrust of their sagacity.All this your will consider, perhaps, as affording fresh evidence of an 'exclusive spirit' on my part. This objection has been made against abolitionist from the beginning. Colonizationists and gradualists have always complained of our exclusiveness, and enquired why we could not join hands with all who, in their own way, are opposed to slavery? But we have resolutely refused to come down into the month plain of One. Until recently, we have unsparingly denounced those who but declined to put forth active efforts in favor of abolition. But 'a change has come over the spirit of our dream,' and now, forsooth, we must utter no censures against those who actively sustain the slave system!Far be it from me to delight in penning censures. I desire to be as liberal as truth and rightenousness will permit. The rule of Christian charity, as I conceive, is, 'to be liberal where God and Truth are liberal, and rigid where they are rigid.' On some points, I am quite as liberal as yourself and my Boston friends. I denounce not as 'schismatics' and 'presumptuous,' those who choose methods of voting for liberty which I may deem inexpedient. My censures are reserved for those who vote for slavery; for pro-slavery and slaveholding candidates. Let a jury of slaves be impannelled to determine whether your liberality or mine is of the right stamp. We should 'remember them that are in bonds as bound with them.''I think I have observed,' with you, 'in our association, a tendency to too much management.' If, as you intimate, 'this disposition be inherited from the Puritans,' I hope their descendants 'in the town of Boston' will not seek to extend their jurisdiction 'ultimately' beyond 'Rhode-Island' into my native State of New-York. 'I would as soon drive a gang of slaves with a whip' as to coerce freemen by the cry of 'heresy' and 'schism'! And by the way, let me correct your strange error in supposing that I ever advocated a 'non-resistant resolution,' as that term is, now used, including a disbelief of the right of civil government and of penal law. I only advocated the peace principles of Penn, not merely because 'expedient,' but because right, as I believed, and a part of our original anti-slavery Declaration, and essential to our peaceful success.You tell me that five of the Massachusetts Board are democrats. Then I am the more sorry, that 'they did not once think of Harrison and Van Buren.' I hope they will, ere long, assure us explicitly that they regard not, with the least favor, 'the least bad of them' and that you will join heartily in the same declaration.                                have     in their own way          With the best wishes,Your fellow servant,WILLIAM GOODELL.        

 DEBATE IN THE LEGISLATURE. We have given, in another part of our paper, a sketch of the debate in the Massachusetts Senate, on the resolves in relation to the right of petition, and the abolition of slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia. We are obliged to postpone the comments which we intended to append to this debate. The manly and fearless advocacy of those resolves by the youthful and eloquent DAVIS, will ever redound to his credit, and send his name down to posterity with that of the lamented ALVORD. The pro-slavery course pursued by Wood of Worcester, Willard of Middlesex, Hubbard and Savage of Suffolk, shall not escape that flaggellation which justice imperatively requires.     

       MR. EDITOR:I observe that the article of mine, entitled 'Hints to Abolitionists on Political Action,' published some time since in your paper, has drawn down upon my head and yours, a most violent attack from Mr. Goodell, in the Friend of Man.He says 'In the whole compass of pro-slavery literature, we hardly know where to find any thing more abominable and execrable, more unprincipled and wicked, than the advice given by this writer;' and he extracts out of my article, after the clerical method of condemning heresies, no less than eleven propositions, all of which he seems to consider as utterly damnable.I have not time to go over all these propositions, nor is it necessary. The gist of the whole matter is contained in the 10th, which is as follows:10. Abolitionists have committed a great error in maintaining the doctrine, that duty can be discharged by merely doing that which is right in itself, leaving God to take care of the consequences. They ought to have learned, in the school of this 'Plain Man,' that duty is to be decided by an estimate of the consequences. They ought to have been instructed by Paley, Hume, Hobbs, and Godwin, (with the D.D's of colonization and gradualism,) that utility is virtue, that gain is godliness, that expediency is duty, and that when vice is more beneficial than virtue, the obligation to virtue is superseded, or rather, as some have it, that virtue and vice are only other names for apparent profit and loss, advantage and disadvantage.Mr. Goodell, in the same paper which contains his violent attack upon me, has inserted a long article in reply to the editor of a Baptist paper in Utica. That paper had complained, because so much money was spent upon anti-slavery agents, which ought to go to the cause of foreign missions; and alleged that the bodies of those millions of slaves were nothing, compared with the perishing souls of six millions of heathens. To this Mr. Goodell has replied in an article which I read with astonishment and delight. His answer, in substance, is this. All religion, which does not lay its foundation in humanity, which does not manifest itself in active benevolence to the bodies as well as the souls of men, is false and worthless. To hear this declaration from the mouth of a Presbyterian, astonished and delighted me. The human mind is making progress. I hope Mr. Goodell may not be excommunicated for this heresy.Perhaps, if he reflects a little more, he will come to the conclusion, as I have done, that all 'doing right,' which is not based upon humanity, is false and spurious. No action, in my opinion, is virtuous, which does not tend to promote the good of others; no action is wrong, which does not tend to inflict some injury upon others.If this be so, what shall we think of those persons, who talk about doing right, irrespective of consequences? I have no means of knowing that an action is good, except by knowing that it tends to produce good to somebody; I have no means of knowing that an action is bad, except by knowing that it tends to produce harm to somebody; and how can I know what it will produce, except I look to the consequences?This doctrine of doing right, without regard to consequences, turns men into mere blind and subordinate slaves, who are to obey, without doubt or hesitation, all the commands of those who set themselves up as moral and spiritual guides.'It is right to vote only for abolition candidates,' says Mr. Goodell 'any man who votes for a candidate who is not an abolitionist, does wrong. To advise any man so to vote is abominable, execrable, unprincipled and wicked.'I meekly attempt to show, that, by aiding to elect Harrison, besides accomplishing some objects which appear to me important to the country at large, I shall, in fact, weaken the slaveholding influence, and so aid the anti-slavery cause.To this, Mr. Goodell replies 'Hold your tongue, you abominable, execrable, unprincipled, wicked babbler! What are consequences to you? Do right, without regard to consequences. No matter what consequences would follow voting for Harrison, even though it might result in the freedom of all the slaves in the Union. I say it would be wrong, I say it is wrong, irrespective of consequences, to vote for any man who is not a professed abolitionist.'So it seems that Mr. Goodell, in delivering us from the yoke of the two political parties which he describes as so heavy, only intends to subject us to a yoke of his own making. To be sure, he does not yet hold that every abolitionist is absolutely bound to vote for Mr. Birney, but he will come to that presently.For my part, I intend always to exercise the right of doing the best I can, under existing circumstances, to secure a good government. A half a loaf I hold to be better than no bread. If it is not, it will be easy to show why and that is a task to which Mr. Goodell had better address himself. Undoubtedly, if by refusing the half loaf, I could get the whole one, I ought to refuse it. But can we get the whole loaf? Are we not in danger of losing even the half?Having denounced my article as 'abominable, exercable, unprincipled and wicked,' I claim it as an act of justice, that Mr. Goodell should publish that article at length, and the present one along with it.                                  A PLAIN MAN.     

 'THE EDITOR'S DOOM.' The editor of the Emancipator, in his last number, has two columns of remarks under this caption, in vindication of himself from the charges we have felt it to be our duty to bring against him. It is a remarkable defence, which we may take occasion to examine in another number. Mr. Leavitt exhibits, we are sorry to say, a sneering and bitter spirit, similar to that which has been evinced toward the Liberator and its editor by such men as Leonard Bacon, Joseph Tracy, and other of our opponents.     

          TAUNTON, April 22d, 1840.   BROTHER GARRISON:The Bristol County A.S. Society met in this place yesterday, in Mr. Emery's house. There was a large delegation from the surrounding towns, and many of the true-hearted and unflinching, who have stood against the assaults of persecution, and breasted the storm of intolerance which has raged here with such violence, were there to cheer and warm each others' hearts by mutual [ ]intercourse. There was also a goodly number of the 'seceders for peace' present, and they showed their love of peace by giving battle to us! A series of resolution were introduced in the morning by the Business Committee, condemning the desertion, by the professed friends of reform, of the pioneers in any good enterprise, while they continued firm and true, as an evidence of 'vaccillation or treachery, or both;' and asserting our confidence in yourself, and encouraging the circulation of the Liberator and Cradle of Liberty. These resolutions were drawn by Dr. Mansford, a gentleman recently from Savannah, Geo. They drew forth a good deal of discussion on both sides. Rev. Messrs. Andrews and Emory opposed them, and tried to sustain the character of the New Organization against the charges which were made against it. They 'grieved much that this discussion should take place. It would most surely injure the old society, and be a decided benefit to the new.' They grieved that the old rotten-hearted, no-government, woman's rights, staffless society should be injured. They grieved that a society, which had attempted to hang a mill-stone about the neck' of the enterprise, should be harmed, and that another society, which was 'the only hope of the enslaved,' should be assisted by our efforts! We did not grieve at this discussion. It ought to have taken place long ago, so as to have fully informed the people on what ground we stood, and who were our enemies. These lovers of peace manifested their combative and destructive faculties rather too much for peaceable men, (defining peace by their own rule.) They went off from us for peace, but they could not stay. They must come back, and try to quarrel some others off for peace. Peace-makers with a vengeance! The resolutions were discussed through the day, and finally adopted. In the evening, we had up a resolution on prejudice, and some upon the pro-slavery church and clergy. Jackson, Collins, Whiting, Dr. Mansford, Remond and others, spoke. Our meeting has been full of interest, and has undoubtedly done good. It had been intended to hold the meeting but one day, but, owing to the amount of unfinished business which lay on our hands, it was adjourned to this morning.    grieved    Yours for the right,C.M. BURLEIGH.      

 ARRIVAL OF CHARLES STUART. The Emancipator announces the arrival of this untiring philanthropist at New-York, from Jamaica, in good health. He has proceeded to Toronto to visit his relatives, and intends embarking in the Great Western on the 9th May, for England; so that he will not be able to attend the annual meeting of the Parent Society. It is stated that he brought a liberal donation for the Anti-Slavery treasury from the freedmen of Jamaica, who 'can't take care of themselves!'     

       The annual meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society of Worcester Co. (North Division,) was held in the Town Hall, Leominster, the 15th inst. There was a larger number of delegates present than usual, which seemed to encourage the hearts of the friends of the slave; and the interest of the meeting was greatly increased by the presence and aid of brethren Collins, Jackson and Chace, from abroad. A lecture was expected from bro. Garrison in the afternoon, for which purpose the Unitarian meeting-house was procured, but many were disappointed to learn that the state of his health, and the pressure of his duties at home were such as to prevent his attendance.The meeting was called to order by the President, J.T. Everett, of Princeton.Rev. Sumner Lincoln, of Gardner, addressed the throne of grace.All persons present, holding to the principles of immediate emancipation without expatriation, were invited to take a seat with the Society.A committee of nomination was chosen, consisting of Sumner Lincoln, of Gardner; James Davenport, of West Boylston; Simon Fosket, of Westminster; John Mirick, of Princeton; W.S. Wilder, of Fitchburg; George Gerry, of Leominster; Nahum Stratton, of Bolton; Samuel Spofford, of Berlin; and Jonas Bateman, of Harvard.A committee was chosen, consisting of Alvan Ward, of Ashburnham, and John Bartlett, of Berlin, to prepare a list of delegates 82 names were reported.A business committee was chosen, consisting of brethren Collins, Chase, and Whiting, of Boston, Lincoln, of Gardner, and Davenport, of W. Boylston.The following letter from Wm. Lloyd Garrison was read by the President.                   BOSTON, April 14, 1840.   MY DEAR FRIEND:As I have been advertised to be at the Leominster meeting to-morrow, and have held out the hope that I might be able to do so, I fear that my absence will create some disappointment to those beloved associates, who may give their attendance. But, knowing as I do, that I could be of very little service even were I present that, doubtless, brothers Lincoln, and Chace, yourself and other speakers, will be at the meeting and, especially, that our large-hearted and eloquent brother James C. Jackson, so recently restored to us from the very jaws of death, will also be with you, to pour forth his soul under the inspiration of divine love my mind is greatly relieved, and I have no doubt that you will have an interesting and profitable gathering.At the present time, we are passing through a trying and fearful crisis. The love of many in our ranks has waxed cold the faith of many, in the omnipotence of truth, has given way to unbelief our house is, to some extent, divided against itself and some of the most prominent individuals in our cause seem bent, not merely upon narrowing down our platform to their sectarian or political views, but even upon destroying the American Anti-Slavery organization altogether! In such an emergency, we need much of that wisdom which is of God unfailing trust in his great and precious promises deliverance from that fear of man which brings a snare the sympathy of JESUS yearning in our bosoms for the suffering and the dumb an eye that is single, that our whole body may be full of light a disposition that can cheerfully make frequent and liberal sacrifices in the cause of bleeding humanity a spirit of earnest supplication, that the will of God, and not our own, may be done on earth as it is in heaven perfect emancipation from sectarism and party thraldom the one baptism of the Holy Ghost and that faith which overcomes the world. Believing that our sacred enterprise was commenced upon right principles; that, sooner or later, in some form or other, it must triumph; that, of a truth, it has been owned and blessed of God, in a signal manner, since its commencement; that there are multitudes of good men and women in our land, who never will abandon it, come what may, new organization or disorganization, persecution or toleration, condemnation or applause; and, knowing as I do, through what trials and perils it has victoriously passed, each time coming forth from the fiery ordeal purer and more precious than ever, I cannot allow my mind to be filled with despondency, even in view of all that is transpiring around or among us. Our numbers may be diminished by apostacy our ranks divided by faction our operations, for a time, impeded by political ambition and sectarian animosity: but these are not, necessarily, evidences either of the unsoundness of our cause, or the uncertainty of its final success. No! Blessed be God, that with all possible confidence and exultation we may exclaim, no! The real trouble is, that, the people are too many in other words, that we have multiplied too fast for the purity and efficiency of our enterprise; and it is only those who are 'fearful and afraid,' who are disposed to bow down upon their knees to drink, that now turn from the conflict with the Midianites. So long as there remain three hundred souls, who put their trust in God, and have faith to take him at his word, the cause is safe, our triumph is certain, and the day of jubilee shall be ushered in with thanksgiving and praise, and with the grateful confession 'Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glory!' Trusting that there will be none but 'lap-water abolitionists' at your meeting to-morrow, I remain,           Yours, in opposition to all iniquity,WM. LLOYD GARRISON.     During the forenoon, afternoon, and evening sessions, the following resolutions were presented, and, after a faithful and animated discussion, adopted.Resolved, That we regard the prejudice manifested towards the free colored man as having its origin in slavery, and that it becomes the duty of abolitionists to aim at its extinction in their own hearts, as well as from society at large.(The second resolution was in relation to the refusal of Governor Morton to sign the anti-slavery resolves, passed by the Massachusetts Legislature, and was not found among the papers transmitted to the hands of the Secretary.)Resolved, That the strong hold of slavery is to be found in the course pursued by the northern clergy and the northern church, in reference to it.Resolved, That we rejoice in the increasing evidence, that the strong hold of slavery, as it has hitherto existed in the northern ministry and church, is giving way.Resolved, That while we call upon all those who love the slave to withdraw all their pecuniary support from pro-slavery churches, ministers, and benevolent associations, yet we would have it distinctly understood, that we have no hostility to them as churches, ministers and benevolent associations, but oppose them as being inimical to the great cause of immediate and unconditional emancipation.Resolved, That this society regard 'The Weekly Contribution Plan,' recently adopted by the Board of Managers of the Massachusetts A.S. Society, as being pre-eminently adapted to equalize our contributions; to supersede the necessity of sustaining financial agents, by throwing the responsibility of raising funds upon the abolitionists; to save the lecturer from the embarrassment, consequent upon repeated application for funds; and cordially recommend its immediate adoption by the abolitionists of this Division.Resolved, That the sole bond of union among abolitionists, on which they have a right to insist on the anti-slavery platform, is the great object and principles set forth in their constitution; consequently all who practically embrace these, however widely they may differ on other subjects, are worthy abolitionists.Resolved, That to arraign any person on the anti-slavery platform, who practically embraces the great object and principles of the anti-slavery enterprise, for his or her opinions and practices in relation to other subjects, strongly savors of the odious spirit of sectarianism.Resolved, That it is the settled opinion of this Society, that the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society and its auxiliaries ever have adhered strictly and exclusively to original, constitutional abolitionism; and that the charge of a departure, and of dragging in foreign subjects, is without any foundation in fact.Resolved, That we call upon all the true friends of the slave to go up to the annual meeting of the American A.S. Society, to be held in the city of New-York, on the 12th of May next; as there is every reason to believe that questions are to be acted upon at that meeting, which vitally affect the interests of our cause; and that on the course which that Society may then adopt, will depend its very existence.Resolved, That we deprecate the recent attempts that have been made to establish a third political party, and trust our friends will not sustain those candidates who may be nominated by such a party.Resolved, That we recommend the Cradle of Liberty as being strictly anti-slavery conducted with great ability and the cheapest anti-slavery paper in the land.Resolved, That the state of the treasury of the Anti-Slavery Society is such as requires immediate relief, and therefore this Society earnestly request every auxiliary in this Division to take prompt and efficient measures to raise funds for its relief, and forward it forthwith to H.G. Chapman, Treasurer, 25 Cornhill, Boston.The following officers were chosen by the Society.President J.T. Everett; Vice Presidents James Davenport, Charles White, George Miles, Isaac Stratton.W.S. Wilder, Rec. Sec.Sumner Lincoln, Cor. Sec.Silas Walker, Treasurer.Samuel Stratton, Auditor.Counsellors Edward Kendall, Jr., Isaac Smith, Samuel Spofford, Alvan Ward, Nathan Tolman, George Hoit, George S. Flint, Alpheus Godding, John Boutelle.                                               W.S. WILDER, Secretary.   Fitchburg, April 21, 1840.    

 TRINIDAD. From letters received at New York, and published in the Colored American, from some respectable colored emigrants at Trinidad, it appears that the hopes of those who have emigrated to that colony have by no means been realized. The American is strenuously opposed to the Trinidad and British Guiana scheme of emigration. So, we perceive, is the British Anti-Slavery Reporter at least, it gives no countenance to the scheme.      

     WORCESTER, April 20, 1840.   MR. GARRISON:DEAR SIR In behalf of the committee who sign it, I respectfully request the insertion of the following notice in the Liberator and Cradle. By so doing, you will oblige some of your subscribers, as well as       Yours for the slave,      CHARLES T. TORREY.        The abolitionists of the United States, favorable to the election of JAMES G. BIRNEY of New-York, and THOMAS EARLE of Pennsylvania, to the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, in accordance with the nomination of the late National Anti-Slavery Convention at Albany, are invited to attend a meeting in the city of New York, immediately after the next annual meeting of the American A.S. Society, on Tuesday, May 12th, at 4 o'clock, P.M. to respond to the said nomination, and take measures for promoting the election.     ALVAN STEWART,WM. GOODELL,           

 To such of our anti-slavery friends, in this State and elsewhere, as contemplate being at the annual meeting in New-York, we are requested to state, that arrangements have been made for their accommodation, on very moderate terms, during their stay in that city. This fact, we hope, will induce very many to be in attendance on that important occasion.     

 MR. GARRISON:If you can find room for a word from 'such a person' as the subscriber, I would just say, in order to calm the excited fears of the Board of the Mass. A.S. Society, that, having a pretty good acquaintance with the views of the friends of the 'new organization' in the six western counties of this State, I do not believe a solitary man can be found, who is in favor of dissolving the American Society, now, or ever, till the work is done for which it was instituted. Mr. Root (no longer an agent of the Society) is the only person in the State, by whom that, or his own plan, set forth in the article you copy from the Emancipator, has ever been advocated, so far as my knowledge extends. The same thing is true, in relation to all the last seven 'horrible monsters,' set forth by your Board. the gross misrepresentation of the views of some on the first three points must be very evident to nine in ten of your readers, though it was doubtless unintentional.        CHARLES T. TORREY.     

 CLERICAL SYMPATHY. A correspondent of the Herald of Freedom says, that a Baptist minister in that State, Rev. Mr. Swain, on being invited to attend an anti-slavery meeting in his town, feelingly remarked, 'It is too cold to have any thing to do with niggers.'     

              The writer is one of the early friends of the Anti-Slavery cause. For nearly six years, he has been intimately connected with the transactions of the Society; and his time and his labors have been devoted to the promotion of its professed object, and none other.Twelve months ago, the dissensions prevailing among us, led him to reflect much on the nature of Societies or Organizations, and their uses, when applied to an enterprise like ours. He did not forget, that the American Society had done much which, perhaps, in the existing circumstances of the country, no other instrumentality could so well have effected but it struck him, that the dissensions referred to were nothing more than the natural fruit of our Society, and that they had advanced to a burdensome maturity, which demonstrated that the Society was no longer really necessary in the prosecution of our object, indeed, that it was rather a hindrance than an aid.However, finding among those with whom he conversed but few who were willing to give entertainment to such an idea, the writer continued, laboring for the cause, and hoping for the best, as if the Organization contained within itself the most efficient power to act with. But on a calm survey of our history for the last year, and of our present condition, his former doubts and distrust have recurred with augmented force.It now seems clear to him, that the Anti-Slavery Organization has effected all that an organization could effect in such a cause and that its continuance is no longer necessary.The dissensions prevailing among us are such as might naturally have been looked for. Whilst our principles brought together good men of all persuasions, sects and denominations, their views as to other important subjects were exceedingly variant Out of an organization, these views would rarely have come in collision. But in it, they have been pressed together; and as happens in other cases where there is a similar pressing together of heterogeneous materials, disagreement has been made apparent.Nor ought we to have calculated, that there would not occur to our association what has occurred to so many others; that there would not join it men who, fancying their views were more comprehensive and exalted than those of the mass with whom they were united, would endeavor to make the ostensible object of the association, and those who had come together for that alone, subsidiary to some other object deemed by them of higher value; that in proportion to the importance they attached to their object, they would strain themselves to accomplish their ultimate designs-and that those who were to be used, not being prepared to go beyond the simple object they had in view at setting out, would revolt from the use attempted to be made of them.Any one who reflects on these causes will not be surprised at the existence of the dissensions; nor will he look for them to subside, so long as the discordant materials out of which they spring are kept close pressed together by means of a Society. These remarks are made, without intending to pronounce which of the parties to the existing dissensions is right or wrong.The writer will not enter on any protracted argument on this subject. He professes nothing more than to offer suggestions hoping they may be made auxiliary to sound and philosophic conclusions.No one, he takes it for granted, will suppose, because he thinks the present association unnecessary, that he is, on that account, the less solicitous about the success of the CAUSE. It is his solicitude alone for the cause, that has led him to say what he has. The Anti-Slavery Society, independently of its aiding the anti-slavery cause, he looks on as of no use or value. To keeping it alive, for the advancement of other objects than the one for which it was projected, the writer is utterly opposed.Some who have never suffered such a thought as the dissolution of the Society to enter their minds, may be alarmed at first hearing the proposition, and be ready to conclude that if the Society be dissolved, the whole anti-slavery movement will come to nought. It is not denied, that there is danger that the movement may come to nought. But, as I view it, the danger is decidedly greater with the Society as it now is, or promises hereafter to be than without it. If the anti-slavery cause should require a now structure of any kind to sustain it, circumstances will soon point out how it ought to be built. Certain it is, that another Society will never be called for.Believing, then, that the American Anti-Slavery Society is no longer necessary for the advancement of the anti-slavery cause but rather (owing to our dissensions) a hindrance, bringing the whole anti-slavery movement into disrepute, it is proposed for your serious consideration, whether THE SOCIETY OUGHT NOT TO BE FORMALLY DISSOLVED.                        

 CULTURE OF THE BEET. Speaking of Mr. Child's excellent work on the culture of beet, and the manufacture of sugar, the editor of the Boston Recorder says'So far as we can judge, the book is of that sort, that will instruct and gratify the enlightened and practical farmer; and, consequently, tend to the improvement of the whole business of agriculture, even in the hands of those who think it folly, if not impiety, to do any thing which their fathers before them did not.'       

       Proposed Amendments to the Constitutions of the American Anti-Slavery Society.To the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society.I hereby propose for adoption at the next annual meeting of the Society, the following amendments and alternations in the Constitution, viz.1st. That these words of the last clause of the fourth article be expunged: 'And shall be entitled to vote at the meetings.'2d. The last clause of the fifth article be so amended as to read, 'They shall be elected annually, by delegates duly appointed under the provisions of the ninth article, as amended.'3d. The sixth article be so altered as to read, 'The Board of Managers shall annually elect an Executive Committee, to consist of not less than twelve, nor more than twenty-four members, eight of which shall be located in New-York city, who shall have power to enact their own by-laws, fill any vacancy in their body, and in the offices of Secretary and Treasurer, employ agents, determine what compensation shall be paid to agents, and to the Corresponding Secretaries-direct the Treasurer in the application of all moneys, and call special meetings of the Society. They shall make arrangements for all meetings of the Society, make an annual written report of their doings, the income, expenditures, and funds of the Society, and shall hold stated meetings, and adopt the most energetic measures in their power to advance the objects of the Society five members of said committee, at any duly appointed meeting, shall constitute a quorum.'4th. That the following be substituted for the ninth article: 'Any anti-slavery society or association, founded on the same principles, may become auxiliary to this Society, and be represented at any meeting of the Society as follows: Every State Society shall be entitled to three delegates, every County Society to two delegates and every Town Society to one delegate, provided said town society has enrolled as members fifty or more persons, and to be appointed by said societies at their annual meetings, or by the Executive Committees of said societies.5th. Any person paying into the treasury of this society the sum of one hundred dollars, shall be a life member.                     Yours, for harmony and peace,      A.F. WILLIAMS.     

 'THE AGITATOR.' We welcome to our table the second and third number of this spirited little paper, published at Cleveland, Ohio. Hear it!'The Emancipator proposes the disbanding of the American Anti-Slavery Society, at the next annual meeting. We are confident the proposition will find little favor with the abolitionists of the west. If the action of the State Societies has been such as to deprive the Parent Society of the means of usefulness, let such arrangements be made as will restore the 'staff of accomplishment' to the American Society. But the thought of disbanding should not be entertained.       

       This is to inform you, that, at the ensuing annual meeting, it will be proposed to amend the Constitution of said Society, by striking out the words, 'Which shall be located in New-York,' from the sixth article thereof.     WILLIAM B. EARLE.   Leicester, 4th mo. 14, 1840.    

 TO CORRESPONDENTS. We have on file, for an early insertion, the communication of 'A Plain Abolitionist,' in reply to 'A Plain Man' one from Danvers, giving a sketch of a Fast Day sermon delivered in that town by the Rev. Milton P. Braman a letter addressed to the editor of the Baltimore Farmer by our bro. W.O. Duvall also one from H.C. Wright, &c.The letter of a colored friend at Lowell, in reply to the communication of 'A Colored Man,' published in the Abolitionist, is gratefully appreciated, but we do not deem it necessary to prolong the controversy.The letter of our friend Jesse P. Harriman is very acceptable         

     WORCESTER, April 16, 1840.   To the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society.BRETHREN Deeming it very important to preserve the American Anti-Slavery Society from dissolution, and at the same time fix upon some plan which will reconcile the conflicting claims of the National and State Societies, and promote a proper degree of efficiency in both, as well as restore harmony of feeling on the subject, I beg leave to propose the following articles of addition, or amendments to the Constitution of the Society, to be acted on at its approaching anniversary. I have conversed with very many individuals, who think that something like the following must be adopted and I respectfully request its insertion in the Emancipator, once or more, for their information, and that of others.       Yours for the slave,CHARLES T. TORREY.    ARTICLE. The annual income of the Society shall be (25,000) dollars, not including the expenses of collection. This sum shall be apportioned annually, by a committee chosen for the purpose at the annual meeting, among the several States, as nearly as may be in proportion to the numbers and ability of the friends of the cause, in the several States. If the State Societis, in any case, fail to remit the sums assessed on them within (four) weeks, from the close of each quarter of the year, it shall be the duty of the Executive Committee to send agents into their field, and collect the amount due, together with the expenses of collection, under the general direction of the Committees of the State Societies, as to the places in which they shall make collections. All voluntary donations to the American Society shall be considered as forming a part of the proportionate sum assessed upon the State from which they come. The funds so raised, shall be applied (1) to the preparation, printing and circulation, by sale or gratuitously, of books, pamphlets, periodicals, or other illustrations of slavery; (2) to the support of agents in States which do not assume the oversight of the work in their own limits, and of the secretaries, editors, and financial agents necessary for the collection of its income. The several State Societies shall receive in books, at cost, (one-sixth) part of the value of their respective assessments, when paid in, and shall be entitled to purchase any amount of publications at (five) per cent. advance upon the cost. All profits made on publications shall be devoted to increase the stock in hand. This article shall continue in force three years, and longer, unless then changed.ARTICLE. The business of the Society, at its annual meeting, shall be transacted by its officers, and a delegation of as many persons from each State auxiliary as the State has representatives in the Congress of the United States. Provided, that in those States where more than one State Society exists, the delegation shall be divided equally between the Societies, if possible. If not, the society having the largest number of auxiliaries shall have the greater number of delegates. The business sessions of the Society shall not be considered public meetings, unless by a special vote of the Society; but all its matured action shall be made known, through the press, to whom it may concern.      

       In this city, April 27th, suddenly, Mr. Wm. B. Bridgewater, of Beaver River, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, in the 25th year of his age.    

 The following report of a Special Committee on the subject was presented to the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society, April 16, and by them adopted and ordered to be published:The Committee who were appointed to report on the expediency of recommending to the Annual Meeting any changes that they might think necessary in the organization of the Society, report,That, according to the original structure of the Society, the Executive Committee were to be its representative, invested with all its powers, except when the Society itself was in session. Whatever course of action the Society decided on, at its meetings, was to be carried into execution by the Executive Committee. At all other times, and in all other things pertaining to the advancement of the cause, the Executive Committee were to act according to their discretion subject, of course, to the limitations of the Constitution, and the restrictions which the Society itself might impose.The various Societies, which, it was expected, would be set up throughout the country, were to be organized through the agency of the Parent Society, and they were to be directly auxiliary to it.The Territory on which the American Society was to operate, was to be co-extensive with that of the United States.In this way was the whole ground to be occupied by an uniform system of operations to which the Executive Committee, possessing the vigor of a central power, were to give impulse and direction. For some time, this system was made to operate as it was originally intended. Whilst this was the case, the effects produced were greater than the most sanguine had ventured to anticipate.. . .                  

       The death of WILLIAM LEWIS, which was recorded in the last number of the Liberator, has left a void in the circle of his acquainted, which cannot be easily supplied. His department from early youth was most exemplary, and his temper and disposition remarkably amiable. Although his complexion was deemed to be 'incompatible with freedom,' republicanism and christianity, and it was his lot to live in a land which dooms millions of the human race to hopeless bondage on account of the color of their skin, yet his spirit rose above all such adverse circumstances, and he won his way to the respect and esteem of all with whom he became acquainted. He was a member of the Adelphic Union Society, the members of which followed his remains to the tomb. As a son, he was ever dutiful and kind; and as he was relied upon by his bereaved parents as their only earthly prop, his loss to them is peculiarly severs, though it has been met by them with uncommon fortitude and resignation. His illness was short, but severe: he died calmly in the hope of a blissful immortality, being sweetly resigned to the will of God. Com.  Com   

            It may not be amiss to glance, briefly, at the history of this movement. We have not leisure, just now, to hunt up documents for reference, and must depend upon our recollection of events. The first public movement that contemplated the organization of a National political party was in a convention held in Rochester, Monroe county, New York. This meeting nominated candidates for the General Assembly, and adopted a resolution recommending that the American A.S. Society, then shortly to assemble at Cleveland, to take into consideration the propriety of organizing a national anti-slavery party and nominate Presidential candidates. The meeting also appointed a committee to prepare and present to the people of the United States, an address vindicating the propriety of the measure. That committee, through their Chairman, MYRON HOLLEY, Esq. (than whom there is not in all our acquaintance a man in whose honesty and purity of purpose we have greater confidence,) presented a very powerful and eloquent address, in support of a national organization. All this was but paving the way for the national nomination to be made at Cleveland, and we confess we felt strong apprehensions lest the meeting at Cleveland should acquiesce in the measure. Mr. Holley appeared at Cleveland, introduced his measure, and, in its support, read his address, to a large audience capable of appreciating both the beauty of its style and the force of its argument. But it failed to convince western abolitionists of the propriety of independent nominations. The subject was very freely and fully discussed for nearly two days, and finally laid upon the table. It appeared very evident, we think, from the debate, that had a vote been taken on the proposition, it would have been very decidedly in the negative. Notwithstanding this defeat, the abolitionists of western New York, immediately held a convention at Warsaw, on the 13th and 14th of November, and nominated JAMES G. BIRNEY, and F.J. LEMOTNE, for President and Vice President of the United States. These gentlemen both declined the nomination. Nothing discouraged by this defeat, another convention was called. This was held in Arcade, Gennessee county, N.Y. on the 28th and 29th of January, 1840. From this convention proceeded the call for the National Convention at Albany, which made the nominations mentioned at the head of this article.The meeting at Rochester was held, we believe early in October. The defeat of the measure at Cleveland, in the same month, satisfied its opponents. They supposed the question would not again be agitated, at least, not before the regular anniversary of the A.A.S. Society. The nomination of the Warsaw Convention on the 14th of November, showed them that they were mistaken. They were again alarmed and held in suspense until the last of December, when their minds were again relieved by the appearance of the letters of Messrs. Birney and Lemoyne, declining the nomination. These, we thought, would surely satisfy the friends of the measure that their movements were premature, and that the question would now be permitted to rest until the meeting of the A.S. Society. Again we were doomed to disappointment. On the 20th of the next month, the call was issued for a National A.S. Convention, and the time of meeting fixed prior to the meeting of the American A.S. Society. Why this haste with our eastern friends? Could they not have waited six weeks longer? Then delegates attending the anniversary of the American A.S. Society could have attended the Convention also. The same time and expense would have answered for attending both. Then they might have expected a full representation from the west. By appointing the Convention on the first of April, while the roads were bad, and before the usual time for the opening of lake navigation, they were almost sure to exclude the west from their deliberations. Do not these circumstances and this haste look as though they were not desirous of having the west represented in their Convention as though they consulted only the interests of abolition in certain sections of the country, instead of the whole country? If they have adopted so important a measure as the nomination of National candidates upon sectional considerations, they must not be disappointed if they find their brethren in the west refuse to co-operate with them in a measure which we believe will not only prove injurious to the prosperity of the country, deranging still more its economical interests, and almost entirely destroying its political energies, but will retard the progress of what to our hearts (and, we trust, theirs) is dearer than all the cause of human rights.We trust the Ohio A.S. Society, at its approaching convention, will give a decided expression of disapprobation to this measure, and we call upon the auxiliary societies to express opinions and instruct their delegates, on the subject. We want to hear, and we want our eastern friends to hear, the voice of the Anti-Slavery People of Ohio, not merely the voice of those who can frame a resolution or make a speech.

       We have received and perused, with no ordinary satisfaction, the first number of a small sheet to be issued semi-monthly at Mendon, in this State, called 'THE PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN.' The regular contributors to the paper will be Adin Ballou, (Editor and Publishing Agent;) David R. Lamson, George W Stacy, Daniel S. Whitney, and Wm. H. Fish. Its object is nobly set forth in its title it is, practical Christianity. The editors say, in their Prospectus'We shall bear aloft and magnify the standard of religious truth and duty, for which Jesus of Nazareth died on the cross. With this divine standard, we shall contrast the prevailing religion and manners of the age; approving the pure, and laying the age of REFORM at the root of corruption ... We shall go against war, physical violence, slavery, intemperance, licentiousness, covetousness, and worldly ambition always making practical christian holiness our grand theme, and keeping theological doctrines in their proper subserviency to the ends of revealed religion.'We hail the appearance of such a periodical as another cheering and important sign of the times, and commend it to the patronage of all those who hate iniquity, eschew sectarianism, rejoice in the doctrine of christian perfection, and believe that the will of God is yet to be done on earth as it is in heaven. It espouses the cause of Non-Resistance, Abolition, Temperance, Moral Reform, &c. The editors say'We cannot be governed by the will of man, however solemnly and formally declared, nor put our trust in the arm of flesh. Hence we voluntarily withdraw from all interference with the governments of this world. We can take no part in the politics, the administration, or the defence of these governments either by voting at the polls, holding their offices, aiding in the execution of their legal vengeance, fighting under their banners, claiming their protection against violence, seeking redress in their courts, petitioning their legislatures to enact laws, or obeying their unrighteous requirements. Neither can we participate in any rebellion, insurrection, sedition, riot, conspiracy or plot against any of these governments, &c.          

            The Seventh Annual Meeting of the New-England Anti-Slavery Convention will be held in the city of Boston, on TUESDAY, the 29th of May next, at 10'clock, A.M. and will probably continue two or three days. The various anti-slavery societies in New-England, and the friends of the cause generally, are cordially and earnestly invited to be strongly represented on the occasion.

Sec. of do.Editors of newspapers friendly to the anti-slavery cause, are requested to give the above an insertion in their columns.                         

       We have commenced publishing, on our first page, a series of numbers from the Boston Courier, respecting the Bou.ndary Question; the able and sagacious writer of which emphatically declares There will be no war! Why? Because it is eastern territory, and not southern, that is at stake! And what does the South care, whether Maine receives what justly belongs to her, or is shorn of her fair proportions? It will not extend the blessings of slavery, but the curse of freedom, if Maine shall obtain all that she demands! No slave plantations will be multiplied no additional security be given to the patriarchal system no stimulus applied to the internal slave trade no extra amount of cotton and sugar raised no slaveholding votes multiplied in Congress as a consequence! Therefore, there will be no war!Again. The South very well knows, that a war with England would inevitably peril her slave system, and expose her to all the horrors of a servile war. She is our master, and she has ever ruled us with a rod of iron. Rely upon it, she will never consent to put herself in harm's way, in order to extend Yankee territory not she! Maine may whistle for justice, but to no purpose; and all because the South is not to be specially benefitted! Yet, though this fact is as palpable as the noon-day sun to the eye of any but the incurably blind, Maine is at this moment licking the very spittle of the tyrannical South, and bowing the knee to the Moloch of slavery! O servile and degraded State! verily, thou hast thy reward! Nay, so low art thou fallen, thou hast not even the spirit to lift up a single note of remonstrance against the gag-law, which denies to thy citizens the right of petition as the following report shows:         The committee on the petition of Samuel M. Pond and others, to which was referred the petition of Samuel M. Pond and 225 others of Eli Thurston and 45 others, and Samuel Wood, Jr. and 68 others, addressed to the Senators and Representatives of Maine in legislature assembled, praying them to express to the House of Representatives of the United States, a disapproval of the rule adopted by them at their present session relating to the disposition of petitions and other papers touching the subject of slavery, have had the same under consideration, and ask leave to report that legislation on that subject is inexpedient.     PHILIP EASTMAN, Chairman.   In Senate, March 13, 1840.Read and accepted.Sent down for concurrence.      WILLIAM TRAFTON.   House of Representatives, March 13, 1840.Read and concurred.

       The Board of Managers of the Samaritan Asylum for indigent colored children intend having a sale of refreshments, during the week of the anniversaries in May, to increase the funds of their treasury. Donations of fruit, cake, and other articles that will assist in furnishing the tables, will be thankfully received, and may be left at Miss Parker's, No. 5, Hayward Place; at Mr. Shipley's, No. 64, Hanover-st.; at the office of the Friend of Virtue, No. 2, Chapel Place; at the Anti-Slavery office, No. 25, Cornhill; or at the office of the Abolitionist, No. 32, Washington-st.    D.C. GOULD,M.A. HOLLAND,}    Boston, May 1, 1840.    

       It appears that the Executive Committee of the American A.S. Society have, within the last week, sold the Emancipator to Joshua Leavitt; so that the abolitionists of the United States are now without an official organ!! This act of the Committes, we are sure, will excite general surprise and indignation in the abolition ranks. If it be not a breach of trust, it is at least highly reprehensible. It is perpetrated, be it remembered, suddenly, without a moment's warning, some three weeks before the annual meeting in New-York! And what is the plea set up? Why, that there are no funds to sustain it! We shall not stop here to ask, why there are no funds but shall briefly examine the plea. If it be well founded, then it might have justified the suspension of the Emancipator for a short time, but not the sale of it; for, we conceive, the paper has not been the property of the Committee, but of the Society. Thousands of dollars have been taken from the common treasury to sustain it. Who believes that the credit of the Society was so low, that the Executive Committee could not get it printed until the 12th of May, without disposing of it to a private individual? To our mind, it is very evident why this extraordinary procedure has taken place. 'Coming events cast their shadows before.' It has obviously been done to place the Emancipator out of the power of the annual meeting, which, it is apprehended, will demand a change in the Committee, and in the editorship of that paper. Certainly, they have no reason to believe that the course they have pursued, for some time past, will receive the approbation of the Society. We could scarcely be made to believe, that such a transfer had been made of the Emancipator, were it not for the following Protest, which has been transmitted to us for publication by a member of the Executive Committee, and which is exceedingly creditable to the head and heart of its estimable author. Our brethren of the anti-slavery press should give it a prompt insertion in their columns, as it contains information that should be laid before the abolitionists of the country.    

       THE BOSTON TYPE AND STEREOTYPE FOUNDRY, is removed to Minot's new building at the corner of Devonshire Street and Spring Lane Entrance in Spring Lane.The patrons of this Foundry are respectfully informed, that by this removal the Proprietors have secured the best of accommodations and facilities, for the manufacture of Types and Stereotype Plates. The location is central and convenient for the trade, and every exertion will be made to retain the extensive patronage hitherto afforded to the above foundry.Orders addressed to J.G. ROGERS, Agent for the Company, will be faithfully attended to.         9epis8t.     

       The last number of the Christian Witness, the organ of the Western Pennsylvania A.S. Society, contains the following explicit and timely resolutions, on the subject of political action. We are glad to perceive that the Albany Convention and a third party are discountenanced by abolitionists in all parts of the country. The national meeting in May next will be not less emphatic, we opine, in relation to these matters.       Resolutions of the Executive Committee of the Western Pennsylvania A.S. Society.Resolved, That while we admit the right of any of our citizens to meet in their citizen capacity, and nominate whom they may prefer as suitable recipients of their free suffrages, yet we feel it our duty as the Executive Committee of the Western Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, to make known our decided conviction of the manifest impolicy and impropriety of identifying the American Anti-Slavery Society, or any of its auxiliaries, with the corrupting influences of political partyism, in any shape whatever, however speciously it may be wrought up and presented to those societies.Resolved, That we wholly disapprove any and every attempt to procure the unity of Anti-Slavery Societies, as such, with the formation of 'Electoral Tickets' to sustain the recent nominations of the Albany Convention; and shall deprecate with sorrow the conversion of our anti-slavery journals from their unanimously approved work of enlightening the public mind, and pleading the cause of the slave before the 'conscience of the nation' and the world, to the sectional and still questionable purpose of building up popularity for such a 'ticket.' And more especially in the present case, since it is certain that these nominations have been made contrary to the views of a large majority of the abolitionists of the United States. Until there be greater unanimity, we shall esteem such a movement peculiarly unwise and inexpedient.Resolved, That we regret that any respectable newspaper should have recklessly announced, as certain political presses have done, what is destitute of truth; vix. that 'The Anti-Slavery Society met at Albany,' had made said nominations.It was not the act of any Anti-Slavery Society, but the movement merely of certain free and independent citizens of the United States.Resolved, That the foregoing resolutions be published in the Christian Witness.               HENRY HANNEN, Sec.   VERY MANLY! The Abolitionists, after informing its readers that 'another manifesto has come forth from the Board of Managers of the Mass. A.S. Society, addressed to the Abolitionists of the U.S.' says, it has 'received a communication, pretty thoroughly reviewing the document,' which he promises to publish next week: it will take good care, of course, that the Address shall not be inserted in its columns! it tells the following story:'A most valuable member of the Albany Convention, Mr. Pierce of New-York, stated that he should not have attended that meeting, but for the over-bearing manifesto of the Massachusetts Board, or rather of the editor of the Liberator, against it.'Very well. This is not the first time that a man has done a very foolish thing, in order to show his independence! Some persons in this State, by way of proving that they were not to be enslaved, and that they had a sacred regard for 'homebred and fireside rights,' drank a great deal more liquor after the passage of the License Law than before! Mr. Pierce is quite a politician in feeling, and it was no cross, therefore, for him to go to Albany, especially as he could thus show, (in the language of our neighbor,) that he was 'a man, and no mouse' ay, and a man not to be dictated to by a remonstrance from the Massachusetts Board! According to the Abolitionist, 'the over-bearing manifesto' alluded to, instead of inducing abolitionists to stay away, rather stimulated them to attend the Convention! We now recollect that our bro. Goodell, in commenting upon it, declared that he was more disposed than ever to be at Albany, because he meant to be independent! Well, we will concede, 'for argument's sake,' that the Convention was much better attended, in consequence of the disapproval of it by the Massachusetts Board. Now, good reader, please to remember, that, with all the additional stimulus pretended to have been given in this manner, only 17 persons were present from all the free States, excepting New York, which furnished 104 out of the 121 members of the Convention the city of Albany contributing 48 out of the 104! Seventeen!! Not a delegate appeared from New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, or Michigan! So, then, according to the logic, and the arithmetic, and the facts of the Abolitionist, there would not have been near so many at Albany, but for the 'over-bearing manifesto'! What is this but a confession, that the abolitionists of the country felt perfectly indifferent to the Convention that it was, in fact, just what we have styled it, a farce? Our neighbor make take either horn of the dilemma.N.B. Neither the Emancipator, Abolitionist, Friend of Man, nor Pennsylvania Freeman, had the fairness to publish, in an unmutilated form, the whole of the 'over-bearing manifesto' no indeed! They suppressed a material portion of it,----- they best know why.             

       This Seminary is designed to prepare Female Teachers. Connected with it is a Model School for practice. The Academic year is divide 1 into three terms of 15 weeks each. There will be a vacation in April, August and January. The first term of the 2nd year will commence on the 1st of May next. Candidates for admission will present themselves at the School at the commencement of the Term. They must be at least 16 years of age, bring a certificate of good moral and intellectual character, pass a satisfactory Examination in the common branches and declare it to be their intention to teach.The shortest time of continuance in the school is one year. Qualified pupils, however, may have leave of absence to teach in the summer term, if desired.Board is $2,00 per week. Tuition gratis.         CYRUS PEIRCE, Principal.

 C.T. TORREY. This individual gives us the first public intimation that has been made of the withdrawal of the Rev. David Root, as an agent of the new organization. We want a better witness than himself to sustain the assertion, that the friends of that organization, in this State, do not sympathize with Mr. Root in his proposal to abolish the American A.S. Society. Why does not the Abolitionist discountenance the project? Mr. Torrey talks of the gross misrepresentation of the views of some, in the address of the Board of Managers to the abolitionists of the United States so gross that it must be very evident to nine in ten of our readers, and yet it was doubtless unintentional on the part of the Board! We insert the political notice signed by Alvan Stewart and William Goodell, merely as an item to be placed on record trusting very few will be found to give it their countenance. It strikes us as somewhat singular, that an hour is selected for the friends of a third party to assemble in New York, which must directly interfere with the business meeting of the Parent Society. Nothing can be more ludicrous than the idea of calling a meeting to take measures for promoting the election of James G. Birney and Thomas Earle, to the offices of President and Vice President of the United States! To think of so grave and cautions a man as William Goodell being implicated in such a foolish procedure!      

       Our non-resistance readers will excuse us, this week, for omitting our Non-Resistance Department, in order to give place to the following summery, which has already been deferred to long.     

 CLERICAL DENUNCIATION. The following article we copy from the New-York Evangelist, the editor of which paper has frequently relieved his overburdened mind in a similar manner:LIBERATOR AND EMANCIPATOR. The Liberator comes out with violent denunciation of the Emancipator, and its editor, the Rev. Joshua Leavitt. Mr. Garrison is convinced that Mr. Leavitt has not the clear-sightedness, and freedom of soul, essential to one occupying so important a station; and has solemnly announced, that either the views and feelings of Mr. Leavitt must change, or the editorial chair of the Emancipator be filled by another.The sentiments of Mr. Garrison, and his associates, are at war with all social order, and all wholesome society. The members of the American Anti-Slavery Society, if they intend to preserve it from utter destruction, should gather at the annual meeting next May, and put down, by an expressive and decisive vote, the disorganizing doctrines and measures of Mr. Garrison and his party. If this cannot be done if Garrisonism, sustained by female votes, must rule in its councils, all true abolitionists will be compelled to seek some other method of promoting the cause, than by co-operation with that society.The temper of the foregoing is as remarkable as its veracity and consistency. It is charged as a heinous crime upon us, that we have denounced the Emancipator; while the writer of the article does not hesitate to accuse us, in the same breath, of cherishing sentiments 'at war with social order, and all wholesome society,' (!) and of advocating 'disorganizing doctrines and measures'(!) This, of course, is not denunciation O no! What a frightful object we have become especially to a time-serving priesthood!N.B. The Abolitionist, of yesterday, copies the above article from the Evangelist though it no longer ago than last week conceded that the Liberator was one of the best papers published in Boston, and very sincerely (!) exclaimed 'Blessed are the peacemakers!'              

       A dreadful catastrophe occurred on Monday last, April 13, at half past 5 inthe morning, at the factory village of James F. Simmons, on the Pochasset Brook River, R.I. The heavy rains of the previous night raised the stream to such an height that the dam to the upper reservoir gave way, the swollen stream rushed down, overthrowing in its course four other dams, until it reached the village, when it carried away two dwelling houses, three small buildings and a building used as a store, machine shop and dry shed. The stream struck the buildings about eleven feet high, and swept them instantly about sixty feet into the channel. One went immediately to pieces; the other floated away and broke in pieces.There were five families in the dwelling house. One family was all saved. Of the other four, eighteen persons were drowned, and only nine saved. The following are the names of the sufferers:Franklin Randall, aged two and a half years, son of Mr. Benjamin Randall. Mr. Philip Angell and his wife. Mrs. Sarah Rogers, wife of Mr. Abner Rogers. Mr. Oliver Angell, aged 18 years. Emily Ann Angell, aged 6 years, and Benjamin Angell, aged 4 years children of Mr. Philip Angell. Mr. John W. Hull, aged 31 years. Miss L. Hall, aged 28 years. Mr. William McAusland, aged 26 years. Mrs. Matilda Whitmore, aged 46 years. Miss Maloney Whitmore, aged 14 years. Miss Almira Whitmore, aged 12 years. Miss Julia Ann Whitmore, aged 10 years. Miss Laura J. Whitmore, aged 7 years. The above are the family of Mr. Brayton Whitmore who is absent on a visit to Connecticut. Mrs. Martha Witmore, aged 20 years, wife of Mr. Russel Whitmore. Sarah Whitmore, aged 24 years, wife of Mr. Nelson Whitmore. Jenetta Whitmore, daughter of the above, aged 8 months.The bodies have all been recovered, many of them very much injured.The damage to property is about $12,000. A portion of the books and papers had not been discovered yesterday afternoon.. Providence paper.             

       DISASTROUS CONFLAGRATION. We have to record another disastrous fire in Kingston, Upper Canada, which took place on the night of Friday last, during a violent gale of wind. The following buildings were consumed.Counter's, McPherson & Cranes, and the Otway Company's warehouses, with several buildings in the immediate vicinity; the entire square lying North of the market, except the Commercial Bank and three stores next adjoining, fronting on South street, and one small building on the Easterly corner of the square. There were in all about seventy-five buildings consumed.Many persons were injured, and one man, we understand, was killed. A tremendous explosion of gunpowder, which was in one of the warehouses, scattered burning fragments far and wide.An immense amount of property, we understand, was destroyed among which we learn was about 16,000 barrels of flour; one schooner, the Lord Nelson, and one small steamboat, were consumed.          

 FROM TEXAS. The New Orleans papers relate, from a Texas paper, an act of treachery and cruelty towards a party of Camanche Indians, committed by a detachment of Texan troops, under the superintendence of the Secretary of War. The following are the principal facts: A party of about 65 Indians arrived at San Antonio, with a little girl, captured from another tribe, whom they wished to ransom. The chiefs were invited to a council, and while they were assembled in a room, a company of troops was marched in. They were then told they were prisoners, and immediately made battle, and were all shot. The rest of the Indians, who were outside, were also attacked and captured. Their loss amounted to 35 men, 2 women and 3 children. The Texans had 7 killed and 8 wounded. An expedition was to march against the Camanches forthwith     

 'We are informed that fourteen runaway slaves left Cleveland last week in a vessel for Canada among whom was John Randolph's favorite servant JUBA.'The foregoing is from the Painseville Telegraph, of the 26th ult. The following is from the Shield and Banner, of the same date, printed at Marshfield, Ohio:'Within the last three or four months, six or eight wagons have passed through, or near -----, freighted with runaway negroes. On the night of the 9th inst., a wagon with four runaway negroes in it, started from a DEPOT about four miles south-west of -----, accompanied by two abolition whigs, armed with guns and butcher knives, and proceeded towards the grand FOCUS of faction, and treasonable conspiracy, situated about forty miles north-west of -----, where no doubt these runaways will be concealed till they can be smuggled into Canada.'         

 SKETCH OF MONS. BIHIN. This extraordinary personage was born in Westphalia, in 1807, of poor but respectable parents, who gave their son an education commensurate with their limited circumstances. His growth was rapid and astonishing, and although his early life has been marked by no peculiar event, he has, since his arrival at maturity, attracted throughout Europe the attention and curiosity of thousands. He is in height eight feet six inches, and is naturally and finely proportioned. A man of ordinary height can but just reach the bottom of his ear, by holding up his hands and standing on tiptoe! His strength is commensurate with his astonishing stature enabling him to raise three ordinary sized men, and hold them at arm's length without difficulty; his features are handsome and intelligent, and his manner extremely prepossessing and agreeable. N.Y. Despatch.     

 AN AWFUL SLIDE. River du Loup, U.C. April 6, 1840. 'On Saturday morning last, at 8 o'clock, on the south side of the river Maskinonge, beginning at about 8 acres above the bridge, the country for more than two miles above caved into the river, in many places to the depth of twenty acres. Two houses, with several barns and other out-buildings, are buried in the ruins, and about forty animals, such as horses, cows, sheep, &c. &c. No human lives were lost. The whole body of this earth, (comprising several hundred acres,) did not move all at once, out in the course of about three hours. A sugary of about 500 fine maple trees has wholly disappeared: men were making sugar at the time, but had timely notice; seeing the trees moving off into the river, they saved themselves by flight.'The sight of the place is awful in the extreme. The river being filled with earth and timber for more than two miles in length, to a height averaging over forty feet, has caused the river below to be perfectly dry, and I am just informed, (P.M.) that the water, at the Hon. Pothier Mills, has risen twenty feet, being within one foot of the roof, and his carding and clothing mill has gone adrift. The water has yet more than twenty feet to rise, to be on a level with the earth below, and in all probability, this body of water will remain as a lake forever, the dam being formed of a large portion of timber and stones. It is ruin to the mills above referred to, and a number of farmers have lost their all; several whole farms have moved off entire.'       

 REV. S.J. MAY'S EULOGY on the late Professor Follen, at the Marlboro' Chapel, Boston, on Friday evening last, drew together a very full house of intelligent people' who listened with profound attention and apparent satisfaction to an able, ingenious, and interesting address of nearly two hours length. To us, many of the facts relating to the early history of Dr. Follen his personal exertions, sacrifices, sufferings, and persecutions in favor of liberty, were new and exceedingly interesting. We knew that he was a foreigner from Germany a Professor in Harvard University, of course a literary man that he was a friend to liberty, humanity, philanthropy But we did not know, that he was driven from his native land on account of his love of liberty. Lynn Record.     

 CONVICTION FOR MURDER AT SEA. In the U.S. District Court at Baltimore, on Friday, Lorenzo Dow, or Pablo, a sailor, was tried and convicted of wilful murder, in killing Wm. C. Landon, master of the brig Frances, of Boston, on board which the accused was a hand, while on a voyage from Wilmington to Martinique.

They had four days passage from Havana to Charleston; and three from Charleston to New-York; on the Wilmington and Weldon Road.Freedom of the Press. A Newfoundland paper, in speaking of the House of Assembly of that Island, eulogizes it in the following unequivocal language:'Take them for all in all, from the Speaker downwards, we do not suppose that a greater set of low-lived and lawless scoundrels, as public men, can be found under the canopy of heaven.'Louis Philippe, king of the French, has adopted the principle of total abstinence; and Mr. Delavan has no doubt but his decision of character will be the security for his adherence to the principle for the sake of his country's weal. Boston Recorder.On Monday evening the plate voted to Mr. Combe, the celebrated lecturer on Phrenology, was presented to him at the Howard House, New-York, by the ladies and gentlemen who attended his course. The reply of Mr. Combe is represented to have been unusually eloquent, and the whole ceremony quite interesting.A RHINOCEROS USED UP. The New-York Dispatch and Tattler gives the following account of a sudden death in that city:'On Tuesday quite an event occurred at the Zoological Exhibition, Bowery. The Rhinoceros and Elephant having come in contact by some means, the latter swung up his immense trunk, and struck the Rhinoceros such a violent blow in the abdomen, as to knock his breath entirely out of him. The animal thus assailed, did not survive the blow but a few minutes. He was valued at $15,000.'DISGRACEFUL SCENE. It becomes our duty to notice a disgraceful affray, which occurred in the Circuit Court on Saturday last, between two of our most distinguished lawyers, when the lie was repeatedly given, and leaden inkstands thrown from one to the other, until not only the records, but the bystanders, were completely bespattered with ink and blood. Little Rock (Ark.)

       FOR PUBLISHING A SELECTION FROM THE WRITINGS OF THE LATE DR. FOLLEN.BESIDES various articles which Dr. Follen has furnished to periodical journals in our country, he left a large number of manuscripts, many of which would need no alteration to prepare them for the press. It is thought that a selection from these manuscripts, with a republication of some of the articles which have already appeared in print, would be welcomed by his friends as a grateful means of preserving and extending the influence of his mind.Many of his sermons, his lectures on Moral Philosophy, on Schiller and on Switzerland, were completed. He had also made considerable progress in the preparation of a work on Psychology, the introduction to which was completed, and which it was his earnest desire to finish.It is proposed to collect such of these writings as shall appear most suitable for publication, and to prefix to them a memoir, prepared by Mrs. FOLLEN. They will probably fill four duodecimo Volumes, of 300 to 400 pages each, and be divided as follows, viz:1 vol. of sermons and other theological writings.1 do on German Literature, including Lectures on Schiller.1 do on Moral Philosophy, and kindred subjects.1 do Miscellanies, with memoir and portrait.The work will be delivered to subscribers, neatly bound in Boards at one dollar and quarter a volume. An engraving, from the excellent portrait of Dr. Follen, by Gambardella, will be given is one of the volumes, which will be put to press as soon as a sufficient number of subscribers is obtained.

 TO ADVERTISERS. Heretofore it has not been our wish to obtain advertising patronage to any considerable extent, believing that our subscribers would be better satisfied to have the paper filled almost exclusively with reading matter. By the advice of many of our friends, however, we are now induced to open our columns, to a moderate extent, to such persons as may choose to use them as an advertising medium. As our paper has a wide circulation among people of all political parties and nearly every religious denomination, and as our subscribers are confessedly among the most enterprising and energetic portion of community, we can confidently assure advertisers, whether friends or opposers of abolitionism, that they will find it for their interest to avail themselves of the opportunity now presented of enlarging the number of their customers. Book-sellers of all classes, whether literary, scientific or religious, will find the Liberator a medium of advertising quite as advantageous as any of the religious papers of the day. Especially will they find it for their interest to advertise in our columns all works which relate in any manner to the reforms of the day, whether physical or moral; since no class of people feel so lively an interest in all these subjects as the readers of anti-slavery papers. Mechanics, also, of all classes, who do business in the city, and merchants engaged in the retail trade, will find it for their advantage to advertise in the Liberator. We invite them to do so. Our terms, it will be seen by reference to the first page, are very reasonable.We confidently look for patronage, from our friends at least, if not from our opponents.        tf.
