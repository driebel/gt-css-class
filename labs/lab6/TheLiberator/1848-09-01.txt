He subsequently boarded a vesselcoming down the Shannon, bound for America, inwhich he has escaped. A war steamer has been dispatchedin search of the vessel. England—During the last fortnight, the weatherhas been very unsettled. In the Southern countriesespecially, not a day has passed not accompanied withheavy rain. As the wheat has been cut in variousparts, this unreasonable weather not only retardsharvest operations, but must, if it lasts a few darlonger, very materially affect the yield all over thecountry. At present, however, no tendency toapplication has been exhibited. If the potato cropshould prove seriously injured, both in England andIreland—and statements to this effect are rapidlymultiplying—the consequences must be very serious.

The Gardner's Chronicle and other agriculturalpapers continue to give accounts of the spread of thepotato disease. The chief consideration at Paris, at the presentmoment, is the critical state of northern Italy. Numerousdiplomatic meetings have taken place inParis, and Lord Palmerston, in the House of Commons,has stated 'that her Majesty's Governmentare deeply sensible of the great importance of seeinga termination put to that unfortunate warfare.'And he added, 'I am able, although I have noright to speak for another Government, yet I believeI may assure the House that that desire is equallyshared by the French Government. Her Majesty'sMinisters are therefore about—I may way if not alreadyengaged—about to take steps, in conjunction,I trust, with the government of France, for the purpose.of endeavoring, by amicable negotiations, tobring the warfare to a close.' The last journals of from Paris are entirely occupiedwith the Italian question, and the funds have experienceda decline in consequence of its threateningaspect. Ten thousand of the insurgents of June, sentencedIn transportation, have been sent to L'Orient,& where they were confined until the Government,should have fixed their destination. It is probablethat their families will be allowed to join them. An unsuccessful attempt was made on the 6thfor to assassinate M. Theirs.

 MY DEAR FRIEND MAY Y EAR RIEND AY It may not be uninteresting to you, to know somethingof my visit to the city of 'Brotherly Love'. Ileft Boston on the 7th inst, and arrived at Philadelphiaon the next afternoon; the same eveningI attended a meeting of the Vigilance Committee, ameeting held for the purpose of sympathising with,and to aid the fugitive who is making his escapefrom the patriarchs of the South. Such meetingsare always interesting to the most uninterested personwho may attend them. But on that evening the circumstances underwhich the meeting was called, were calculated tomake it more interesting. It was to welcome tohis home and friends, James Lytle, a man who hadbeen born and brought up in Philadelphia, but who,for the last ten or twelve years, has been a slave inthe island of Cuba. He was welcomed to his native city, but not to hisbecome and former friends. Ten years had made agreat change. He went to his former residence,but the mother whom he had left there was not to befound; he inquired for a brother in vain, and insteadof finding his relatives and friends as he had anticipatedhe was doomed to disappointment. The audience, learning that I was in the house,were anxious to give me a welcome also. And onthe part of the meeting, that uncompromising friendof the slave, Robert Purvis Esq, gave me a heartywelcome. He assured me that if the may who claimsmy soul and body as his properly, should undertaketo carry me out of that city, he would find a formidablein that audience, and the hearty responsefrom the multitude that were present, satisfied onethat I was at least safe for the time being. The next three days, I was in attendance at theannual meeting of the Eastern Penn. A.S. Society,at Norristown. I can give no adequate descriptionto the meeting. It was much larger than I had anticipated,and differed widely from a New Englandaudience. No clapping of hands or stamping of feet,as are we heard in a Northern Convention; but the silencewhich reigned through out the different sessions,and the occasional nod of approbation from thecrowd who were constantly in attendance, assuredus that none sympathized with the bondmen morethan they. The meeting was a glorious one for theperishing bondmen in this country. Parker Pillsburyand C.L. Remond were present, and did thebe a good service. But the meeting could not havebeen without interest had they not been present.Pennsylvania has her own sons and daughters, whohas not let the monster rest. The calm but earnest manner of a Mott, the energyefforts of a Purvis, the business-like tactics of aMcKim, the originally and sarcasm of a Whitson,to perseverance of a Davis, and the eloquence ofthe Burlerghs, will never be stifled as long as thefoot-print of a single slave curses the American sold.over the Norristown meeting was over, I lectureda Penn's manor, Newtown, By berry, and Philadelphiapart of the time in company with C.L. Reymond. But shame upon the colored clergymen of Philadelphiaand them churches! With but two exceptationsthey were shut against me. As soon as I arrangedin the city, a committee was appointed by ameeting of colored citizens to secure places and getof meetings for me, and on application, they foundthe doors of all the churches, colored and white,closed against bleeding humanity, except the Big andthe Wesley churches. Honor to them, but shamein the hypocritical religion of the colored manwhich will prompt him to shut his door against aother slave, who comes to him with his back allcarried with the driver's whip, and who wished totell of the wrongs committed upon his race. Suchreligion is no better than that which keeps the millionsin fetters upon the rice, the cotton and sugarintations of the South. And the sooner such aregion is swept from the face of the earth, thebetter it will be for bleeding humanity. W.W. BROWN. New York, Aug, 17. 1848.

 This glorious anniversary was appropriately observedby the friends of freedom in Western New-York.Extensive notice had been circulated in thevarious counties, a majority of which responded inlarge delegatrons by care, stag, canal, packet, andprivate conveyances. The railroad company reducedwe fare, in recommendation to the times, and onthe evening preceding the First, the sub-committeeswere busy occurring those facilities in the publichouses which the proprietors generally tendered.Rochester seemed besieged by Freedom's army.Though the committee of arrangements happened tocolored citizens, yet the celebration was not anexclusive one, but was participated in by every body.The morn was indeed an suspicious one, and whilethe notes of preparation were sounding, all heartsbecame inspired with an anticipation commensurateto the occasion invoking their attendance. Flagswere displayed at prominent stations on Main street,and as they waived in the streets, the uninitiatedlearned the why and wherefore of the gathering ofa men. why wherefore Several Societies, citizens and strangers, unitedprocession under direction of the mounted Marshals,Henry Scott, John Douglass, and E.M.

The hour seems hastening, when evendistribute of this kind will be wholly out of place.show sad a reflection on the yet degenerate times,at to treat man as an equal is an exception to thegeneral rule in these United liberty loving States.  Among the banner inscriptions attracting prominentnotice who one illustrating the Emancipationof 800,000 human beings in the British Rules, follower byan emblem of the Cross—'With this we overcome.Another, 'Ethiopia shall stretch forth herhands to God.' The school children displayed ahandsome presentation—'Knowledge is power'—these words encircling the anchor of Hope. Adam's famed Bugle Band filled the air withthe most witching music; and on arriving at Washingtonsquare, while discoursing the ever animatingand welcome Marseillaise, the processions came to orderaround the platform dedicated to 'Liberty, Fraternity,and Equality'. Marseillaise James Sharpe, of Rochester, as Chairman, in anappropriate salutatory, invited attention to the exercisesof the day. Prayer being offered by Rev.Mr. Watson of Cincinnati, an Ode to Freedom whoeffectively song by the Rochester chair. Subsequentlytheir efforts were augmented by a select GenevaBand, whose blendid voices made the welkinring with harmonious shouts for freedom. David H. Ray read in a distinct and eloquent mannerboth the British and French Emancipation Acts. The first speaker introduced was Frederick Douglass,on whose eloquent and instructive oration it isunnecessary here to dwell. It was pronouncedworthy of the 'Man and the Hour.' Henry W. Johnson of Canandaigua gained freshlaurels by his effort. Already a favorite in the EmpireState, he gives promise of much usefulness inthe good cause. The meeting unanimously soliciteda copy of the speech, which I hope your readers willperuse for themselves. Considerable disappointment was felt by the nonappearanceof Charles Lenox Remond. At intervals, the report of cannon was heard, inimitation of the great American Fourth of July demonstrations. The procession re-formed and marched to theUnited States Hotel, where a dinner was furnishedfor the mass of delegates. Toasts and speeches contributedto deepen an impression of the event theyhad met to celebrate. A Fair, commemorative of the Jubilee, was heldheld at Minerva Hall during the day and eveningParties availed themselves of this medium of interchangingcivilities, promenading, &, an excellentBand tendering its notes to enliven the scene. Irving Hall was tastefully decorated for a 'LibertyFestival,' where many of the more youthful classrepaired to wind up the day in a manner gratifyingto themselves. And thus the whole affair, havingbeen enjoyed in various ways by the vast concourse,was successfully brought to a finale—all feeling evidentlyrenewed by reviewing the past, and hopingthat the present may aid materially to establish apermanent happy future.

 FRIEND Q— RIEND I have waited to see if there would be any responsein the Liberator to the letter of our friendsin Philadelphia on the subject of obtaining from theproducts of slave labor; but as nothing appearsfrom head quarters, I have a suggestion to make.Agreeing as I do on the general view of the subjecttaken by our Philadelphia Friends I am desirers todo something to relieve myself and others as far aspracticable from the necessity of being obliged togive this kind of support to slavery. I have no controversy with Mr. Garrison and thesewho take his view of the questions, for I am awarethat we cannot avoid giving to some extent this kindof support to unrequited labor, without going out ofthe world. Still I would do all that can be doneTherefore, all persons who are in favor makingan effort to avoid (as much as possible) the purchaseof the products of Slave labor, are requiredto meet at the offer of Grandin &. Dudley, No.238 Washington Street, on Friday evening, Sept. 1st.at 7 12 o'clock. to consult upon the measuresnecessary to be taken to form a free labor produceassociation. D.S. GRANDIAN. RANDIAN. 

 Two Conventions have recently been held at SenecaFalls and Rochester, which, though waking upsome wrong feeling among the 'lords of creation,'have nevertheless aimed a blow at prevailing despoticusages, which will be effective in assigning toWoman her just position in society. Proof wasabundantly submitted at these Conventions of woman'sequality with man, exploding the absurd dogmaof her incapacity to take care of herself. Presumingthe proceedings will find place in the Liberator,I forbear further comments. W.C.N. Rochester, Aug 14, 1848 

 ☞The Boston Courier gives the following falseand silly paragraph:— Abby Kelley has take the a stump for Martin VanBuren. Abby Kelley 

 On Monday, the following message was laid onthe table of the Speaker of the House:— WASHINGTON, August 14, 1848. ASHINGTON To the House of Representatives of the United States: To the House of Representatives of the United States: When the President has given his official sanctionto a bill which has passed Congress, usage requiresthat he shall notify the House in which itoriginated of that fact. The mode of giving thisnotification has been an oral message, deliveredby his private Secretary. Having this day approved and signed an act entitled'An act to establish the Territorial Governmentof Oregon,' I deem it proper, under the existing circumstances,to communicate the fact in a moresolemn form. The deeply interesting and protracteddiscussions which have taken place in bothHouses of Congress, and the absorbing interestwhich the subject has excited throughout the country,justify, in my judgment, this departure fromthe form of notice observed in other cases. Inthis communication with a co-ordinate branch ofthe government, made proper by the considerationsreferred to, I shall frankly and without reserve expressthe reasons which have constrained me notto withhold my signature from the hill to establisha government over Oregon, even though the twoterritories of New Mexico and California are to beleft for the present without governments. Nonedoubt that it is proper to establish a government inOregon. Indeed it I has been too long delayed. Ihave made repented recommendations to Congressto this effect. The petitions of the people of thatdistant region have been presented to the government,and ought not to be disregarded. To giveto them a regularly organized government and theprotection of our laws, which as citizens of theUnited States they claim, is a high duty on ourpart, and one which we are bound to perform unlessthere be controlling reasons to prevent it. In the progress of all Governments questions ofsuch transcendent importance occasionally ariseas to cast in the shade all those of a mere partycharacter. But one such question can now beagitated in this country; and this may endangerour glorious Union, the source of our greatnessand all our political blessings. This question isslavery. With the slaveholding States this doesnot embrace merely the rights of property, howevervaluable, but it ascends far higher, and] involvesthe domestic peace and security of everyfamily. The fathers of the constitution—the wise andpatriotic men who laid the foundation of our institutions—foreseeing the danger from this quarter,acted in a spirit of compromise and mutual concessionon this dangerous and delicate subject, andtheir wisdom ought to be the guide of their successors.Whilst they left to the States exclusively thequestion of domestic slavery within their respectivelimits, they provided that slaves who might escapeinto other States not recognizing the institution ofslavery shall' be delivered up on the claim of theparty to whom such service or labor may be due'. upon this foundation the matter rested until theMissouri question arose. In December, 1819, application was made toCongress by the people of the Missouri Territoryfor admission into the Union as a State. The discussionupon the subject in Congress involved thequestion of slavery, and was prosecuted with suchviolence as to produce excitments alarming to everypatriot in the Union. But the good genius of conciliationwhich presided at the birth of our institutionsfinally prevailed, and the Missouri compromise wasadopted. The 8th section of the act of Congressof the 6th of March, 1820, 'to authorize the peopleof the Missouri Territory to form a Constitutionand State Government,' & provides: 'That inall that territory ceded by France to the UnitedStates, under the mime of Louisiana, which liesnorth of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes northlatitude, not included within the limits of the Statecontemplated by this act, slavery and involuntaryservitude, otherwise than in the punishment ofcrimes, whereof the parties shall have been dulyconvicted, shall be and is hereby prohibited: Provided,always, that any person escaping into thesame from whom labor or service in lawfully edin any State or Territory of the United States,such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyedto the person claiming his or her labor orservices as aforesaid.' Provided,always  This compromise had the effect of calming thetroubled waves and restoring peace and good willthroughout the States of the Union. The Missouri question had excited intense agitationof the public mind, and threatened to dividethe country into geographical parties, alienating thefeelings of attachment which each portion of ourUnion should bear to every other. The Compromiseallayed the excitement, tranquilized the popularmind, and restored confidence and fraternalfeeling. Its authors were hailed as public benefactors. I do not doubt that a similar adjustment of thequestions now agitating the public mind wouldlend to the same happy results. If the legislationof Congress on the subject of the other Territoriesshall not be adopted in a spirit of conciliation andcompromise, it is impossible that the country canbe satisfied, or that the most disastrous consequencesshall fail to ensue. When Texas was admitted into the Union, thesame spirit of compromise which guided our predecessorsin the admission of Missouri, a quarter ofa century before, prevailed without any serious opposition.The 'joint resolution fur annexing Texasto the United States,' approved March the first,one thousand eight hundred and forty-five, providesthat 'such States as may be formed out of thatportion of said territory lying south of thirty-sixdegrees thirty minutes north latitude, commonlyknown as the Missouri compromise line, shall beadmitted into the Union with or without slavery,as the people of each State asking ad mission maydesire. And in such State or Stales as shall beformed out of said territory north of the Missouricompromise line, slavery, or involuntary servitude(except for crime) shall be prohibited. The territory of Oregon lies for north of thirty-sixdegrees, thirty minutes, the Missouri and Texascompromise line; its southern boundary is the parallelof 42, leaving the intermediate distance to bethree hundred and thirty geographical miles. And it is because the provisions of this bill arenot inconsistent with the terms of the MissouriCompromise, it extended from the Rio Grande tothe Pacific Ocean, that I have not felt at liberty towithhold nay sanction. Had it embraced territoriessouth of that Compromise, the question presentedfor my consideration would have been of a far differentcharacter, and my action upon it must havecorresponded with my convictions. Ought we now to disturb the Missouri and Texascompromises? Ought we, at this late day, inattempting to annul what has been so long establishedand acquiesced in, to excite sectional divisionsand jealousies; to alienate the people of different portionsof the Union from each other, and toendanger the existence of the Union itself? From the adoption of the Federal Constitution,during a period of sixty years, our progress as anation has been without example in the annals ofhistory. Uneder the protection of a bountifulProvidence, we have advanced with giant stridesin the career of wealth and prosperity. We haveenjoyed the blessings of freedom to a greater extentthan any other people, ancient or modern, undera government which has preserved, order andsecured to every citizen life, liberty, and property.We have now become an example for imitation tothe whole world. The friends of freedom in everyclime point with admiration to our institutions.Shall we, then, at the moment when the peopleof Europe are dovoting all their energies in theattempt to assimilate their institutions to our own,peril all our blessings by despising the lessons ofexperience, and refusing to tread in the footstepsour fathers have trodden? And for what would we endanger our gloriousUnion? The Missouri compromise contains a prohibitionof slavery throughout all that vast regionextending twelve and a half degrees along the,Pacific, from the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes,to that of 49 degrees, and east from that ocean toand beyond the summit of the Rocky Mountains.Why, then, should our institutions be endangered,because it is proposed to submit to the people ofthe remainder of our newly-acquired territorylying south of 36 degrees 30 minutes, embracingless than four degrees of latitude, the questionwhether, in the language of the Texas compromisethey 'shall be admitted (as a State) into the Unionwith or without slavery.' Is this a question to bepushed to such extremities by excited partizans,on the one side or the other, in regard to our newlyacquired distant possessions on the pacific, asto endanger the union of thirty glorious Stateswhich constitute our confederacy? I have an aladingconfidence that the sober reflection and soundpatriotism of the people of all the States will bringthem to the conclusion that the dictate of wisdomis, to follow the example of those who have gonebefore us, and settle this dangerous question onthe Missouri compromise, or some other equitablecompromise, which would respect the rights ofall, and prove satisfactory to the different portionsof the Union. Holding as a sacred trust the Executive authorityfor the whole Union, and bound to guard thethe rights of all, I should he constrained, by a senseof duty, to withhold my official sanction from anymeasure which would conflict with these importantobjects.

 Of the Anti-Slavery Society of Eastern Pennsylvania,New Jersey and Delaware Of the Anti-Slavery Society of Eastern Pennsylvania,New Jersey and Delaware In pursuance of a call of the Executive Committee,the Society met, Eighth month, (August) 9th,1848, in the Baptist meeting-house, in Norristown,Pa. The President, Robert Purvis, called the meetingto order. On motion. Resolved, That all persons present,whether favorable or unfavorable to the doctrinesof the Society, be invited to participate in its discussions. On motion, the following persons were appointeda Business Committee, via: Howard W. Gilbert,James Molt, Grace Anna Lewis, J.M. McKim,Parker Pillsbury of New Hampshire, Wm.

Pexson, and Sarah Pugh, were added tothe Business Committee; and it was Resolved,That this Committee be also a committee of Waysand Means. Wm. W. Brown then sung the song called the'Fugitive's Triumph.' J.M. McKim read the following: The period has again recurred, when it becomesthe duty—as it is the pleasure—of Executivecommittee, to make their report of the state andprospects of the cause within its bounds, to theSociety. And in the performance of this task,they find it impossible to speak in any other thantheir wonted language of cheer and Net because such language has on these occasions, exercising insensibly the forceof an established forms but, because no other woulddo justice to the truth, or adequately express theirown feelings.   The course of the Anti-Slavery movement duringthe last, as in all preceding years he commencement,has been steadily and rapidly coward. That it is desired to a certain and not for distanttriumph has now become generally evident. Theconviction that in some way of other, and at a daynot far in the future, slavery in the United States isto be abolished and especially that the supportgiven to it by the North, is to be withdrawn, is impressingitself generally and irebly upon thepublic mind. As eighteen centuries go, the introductionof the Christian Ear was foreshadowedby a general expectation; as the people wereeverywhere pervaded with the belief that a newprophet would be raised up, charged with gloriousrevolutions from Heaven, and whose invasion itshould be to introduce into the world a new andillustrious dissemination—as now is the day of thiscountry's deliverance from the thrall of slaverypresaged by a similar sign. There is a general expectationamong the people. Men are every whereon the lookout for the occurrence of events, in thenatural progress of affairs, or in the dispensationsof providence, which shall strike the shack les fromthe limbs of the slave, and liberate this otherwiseglorious country from the curse which now hindsit to infamy.  This general expectation is both a sign to heraldthe approaching day, and a cause to hasten itscoming. Its operation in the latter respect—as acause, must be obvious. As men become convincedof the approach of this event, and in proportionto their conviction of its nearness, will theyaccommodate themselves to its coming, and getready to greet its arrival. They will view thewhole subject through a new medium. Passionand prejudice will be dispelled, and reason will resumeher ascendancy. They will see that the doctrineswhich they have been fighting against, arethe doctrines of truth and justice, and that the menwhom they have defamed, deserve their highestrespect. Seeing this, their whole views on thesubject will undergo a change, and their course ofaction receive an entirely new shape. Thus willthe belief in the certainty of Emancipation makeconverts to its doctrines, of thousands who wouldotherwise be impervious; and thus will the expectationhow pervading the people that the day of deliverancefrom slavery is approaching, operate toprecipitate its arrival. With views and feelingslike these, how can we speak in any other tonesthan those of congratulation and lively hope? itwould be impossible. We are fully assured thatthe cause is detained to triumph, and that our mostfondly cherished hopes are to ho realized. Onthese points we leave no doubts; no misgivings;we rejoice in the full assurance of hope. Does any one ask for the evidence, on which isbased such confident expectation? Our answeris, the evidence is within us and around us. It isfelt in the deep convictions of the soul which cometo us simultaneously with our doctrines. So vividis the impress which the truths of anti-slaverymake upon the mind, that an intuitive confidenceof their triumph seems inseperable from their heartyreception. To believe in the truth of abolition,is to believe in its ultimate ascendancy. More palpable evidence than this, however, isto be found in the facts which are every day transpiringaround us; in the accessions which are beingmade by thousands to the ranks of the advocatesof freedom; in the conversion of those whowere once hitter foes, into warm friends; in thefree spirit that is infusing itself into our—till recently—pro-slavery press; in the unanimity withwhich some of our religious sects are remonstratingagainst the evil; in the high stand on the subjecttaken by numbers of the clergy; in the anti-slaveryaction of our State legislatures; in the disappearanceand general condemnation of mob violence;in the diminution of prejudice against thepeople of color, as evinced in the greater respectevery where awarded to them, and the increasedfacilities afforded for their moral and physical improvement;in the place given to anti slavery discussionsin the halls of Congress, Mid the increasednumber, and boldness of our champions in thatbody; in the respect which is now awarded tothose brave men there, by their slaveholding fellowmembers, and the readiness with which theirspeeches are published in papers circulating at theSouth; in the establishment in the Southern States,of papers devoted exclusively to die overthrow ofslavery; and the open avowals made by other journals,of hostility to the slave system; and, aboveall, in the late disruption that has taken place inthe two great political parties of the country, andthe incipient formation of a now party, based specificallyon this question, and having for its end anobject which can only be effectually accomplishedby striking a death blow at the vitals of the slavesystem. These are some of the signs which indicate tous with unerring certainty that the time is not faroff when the object of all our efforts shall be consummate;and it is fitting that on an occasion likethe present, they should be brought out in reviewbefore us, and held up for our encouragement.They serve to reassure and strengthen us, and toanimate us anew for the conflict. But our object at this time is not so much to enlargeupon the state and prospects of the anti-slaverycause in general, as to consider its aspects inour own particular boundaries, and report themeasures which have been employed by this Societyfor its promotion. Our field of operations, itwill be remembered, includes Eastern Pennsylvaniaand the parts adjacent, of Delaware and theState of New Jersey. In all the region embracedin these points, the indications of our advancementare most decisive. All that has been said of thestate of the cause in general may be predicated to agreater or less extent of its condition here. Toenumerate. 1. In the first place, the sound of mob violenceis no longer board in our borders. The State ofPennsylvania, and particularly the city of Philadelphia,used to be notorious for their toleration ofpro-slavery mobs, and their bitter persecution ofthe friends of freedom. Happily this state of thingsno longer exists. Freedom of speech and of thepress on this subject have been fully established,and men may in all parts of the State, so far as anyexperiment has been made, exercise their rightswithout interruption. 2. The free colored people used to be objects ofthe most relations enmity. Every where werethey hunted and persecuted; and is the city ofPhiladelphia, on more than one occasion, weretheir houses entered by violence and sacked; theirproperty destroyed; their public buildings laid inashes, and they themselves obliged to seek safetyin flight. Now a more humans feeling pervadesthe people. Prejudice is giving way; respect istaking the place of hatred, and the spirit of humanitythat of persecution. But a few years since,the colored people of Philadelphia more mobbedfor commemorating the emancipation of theirbrethren in the British West Indian, by a publicprocession; a few months since and they were allowedto participate with the whites brating,in independence squared, the overthrow of despotismin France, and the spread of Impartial freedomin her colonies. And white on that occasion,some were descanting on the glorious deliveranceof the French people from their political disabilities,colored orators in the  of them werecolonizing the sincerity of the revolutionists in extendingof their colonies, and decreasing theemancipation of their bondmen personal slavery.And what is more, the willing, who conditiona majority of their auditory, were the loudest intheir expressions of apprehension. Until very recently,no interest was manifested for the intellectualand moral elevation of the colored of people, excepton the part of themselves, and  of theunless known  abolished,new in addition to the provision of public schools,whose every child may receive the elements of acommon education, the insert in the improvementsof the colored people is becoming general,and ant a manifesting itself try the establishment of newfacilitates for their hands. The measures whichhave lately been taken to eract at a heavy expense,a House of Refuge for the use of colored juveniledelinquents, is an evidence—even while recognizingin the unjust dithering of color—of the greaterimmunity and improved feeling that prevail amongthe people on this subject.     3 The spirit of the newspaper press has undergonea change no fees striking, It used to be thatthe iron of abolition was never introduced into thecolumns of our papers, excerpter for the purpose ofcondemnation. Abolitionists were impelling theredoctrines misrepresented, and they themselves heldup to public odium, or handed over to the tendermercies of the mob; at the some them those paperswere loud in their praises of the slave holders, andingenious in their defences of the slave system. Itis not so now. Our newspaper proms severallytreat abalones with respect, and chronicle thereacts and refer to there doctrines and measures withoutmisrepresentation. Their columns, moreover,in our from or other, teem with anti-slavery discussions.These is hardly a paper in the State,especially in part of it which have been reachedby the operations of the Society, that dose not directlyor indirectly, favor the advancement of ourprinciples. The praises of slaveholders, as such,are rarely sung, and denunciation has taken theplace of apology for the system. 4. In the matter of legislative action, the aspectof our cause look equally encouraging. One yearago we were rejoicing over the passage of a lawprohibiting the use of our jails and the services ofour jailers, Justices of the peace, and other officersin the recaptured and restoration of fugitive salves.Some ferns were then entertained, that at the nextsession of the Assembly, this law would either berepelled, or so modified as to diminish, if not neutralize,its good defects It was known that theLegislative of Maryland and appointed a committeewhose business it was to visit the Legislate areof this State, and use there apprehended by some thatof this law, and it was apprehended by some thatthey would find enough of plaint doughfaces inthat body to enable them to accomplish their purpose;but happily these apprehensions have notbeen realized. Whether this committee ever actedin obedience to there instructions, or if they did,whether they found our representatives too stronglyguarded by public sentiment to make there influenceavailable, we are not able to say; certain itis, however, that the law in question is still on ourstatute books, and by its moral forces, as a demonstrationof the public feeling, independent of itspenal sanctions, is exerting a most satisfactory influence. In New Jersey a law similar in its provisionswas submitted to the legislature at its last session,but public sentiment was either not sufficientlymatured or had not sufficiently indicated itself towarrant the members of that body in its adoption.The support given to the bill, however, was nostrong as to justify fully the expectation that it willpass without difficultly the next time it is presented. In Delaware the adoption by the legislature ofresolution affirming the doctrines of the WilmotProvision, must be regarded as a most auspiciouscircumstance. It places that State in advance ofsome of the Free State, and excites the liveliesthope that it will itself are long become one of theirnumber. The establishment of an anti-slaverypaper in Wilmington during the last year, is anothervery gratifying circumstance in connectionwith the state of Delaware. 5. The evidences of advancement in the religionssects and ministerial profession within our bounds,though sufficiently visible to be encouraging, arenot so palpable as in some others States. A morehumane spirit has infused itself into the religion ofthe community, and the influence of the clergy, sofar as they exert any on this subject, is perhaps, onthe whole, more adverse than favorable to slavery;still ground against the system, and our clergy,with a few honorable exceptions, are extremelycautions now they express themselves in its condemnation.The cause, it is evident, will have tomake much further head way in public favor beforeit can count upon hearty co-operation from thisquarter. 6 It is our political circles, however, that theindications of our progress are the most striking.The nomination, by the Democrat Convention atBaltimore of Gen. Cass for the Presidency, a manwho is a slaveholders in all but the name, and hasshown himself ready to abase himself to the verydust to secure the vote of the South, and of Gen.Taylor, by the Whig Convention at Philadelphia,whose only claims to popular favor, are that he isa large shareholders, and has distinguished himselfin two wars, the one for the preservation and theother for the extension of slavery, have executed intoaction the previously awakened sprit of freedomin the North, and produced a resistance which hasresulted already in the partial division of the twogreat political parties, and promises to terminate intheir complete disorganization. This state of things,though more striking to some other of the FreeStates, is nevertheless extending itself graduallyand hopefully into Pennsylvania. From variousparts of the State, and particularly those parts inwhich this society has bestowed most labor, washear of men repudiating there old political connectionsand uniting on a common platform of hostilityto slavery. This state of thing most be regardedas most hopeful. It indicates that the anti-slaveryelement, has at last fairly infused it self into thepolitics of the country, and that the time has comewhen all other questions must give way to thegreat issues between freedom and slavery. We arenot of those, it is well known, who are disposed toanticipate the greatest advantages from the operationof political machinery, or the co-operation ofmen who make political their trade, but in the presentdecomposition of old parties and the formationof new once, we think we use the incipiency of amovement which is destined to bring default thepeople great questions which have born hithertoagitated only by a very limited class, and to precipitatethese question to a practical decision. If thenew party, now in the process of construction,should be confined in its limits to the NorthernStates, as, with small exceptions it most probablywill, the question will not long be the extension ornon-extension of slavery, but the continuance ornon-continuance of the system where it now exits,and as a preliminary to this, the continuances or non-continuanceof the bond which involves us of theFree State in the gullet and infamy of its support.Already to the demand raised by c, in this newconnection, for a divorce of the Free State from allparticipation in its maintenance; lot this demandbecome general, as sooner or later it inevitablyno met, and the question of dissolution which hasbeen raised by the friends and co-laborers of thissociety will at once be before the people for a practicaldecision:—and the day will them be at headwhen the people of the North and the bond-men ofthe South, will be released, the one from the guilt,and the other from the chains of slavery.  we have thus commentated some of the sings ofprogress made by the anti-slavery cause in Pennsylvaniaand the parts adjacent. They are certainlyhopeful; they indicates a state of forwardness repletewith encouragement, How you this Societyhas contributed to bring choice this stain of things,is a  which through it might to discussedwith profit, we will not  have to consider. Thatit has contributed,  degree however all,even our opponents, submit. For certainly theit has contributed, in nominal degrees, however alleven our oppression whit out For certainly theeffective cause of all the great changes we haveenhancement, has been the moral agitation whichhas been kept up far the last fishes year by theabolitionists; and the part this Society has takenand the extent to which it has participated in thisagitation, is well known to every one we cannottherefore, but recognize in the signs we have beenreviewing, the results in great part of our own horns, and we in those a proof of the correctnessof the principles on which they have beenpronounced.     The measures of the Society during one yourgreat have been the saine in character and aboutthe means in existent as in former years. Our objecthas been by lecturing agents, anti-slavery newspapersthe distribution of truth and other publications,and the holding of convention to scotterlight among the people, and keep up n wholesomeagitation. During part of the year we have hadthe service in the lecturing field of these able andfaithful champions of the cause, Charles C. andCyrus M. Burleigh; though owing to the delicatehealth of the latter, and the necessary for this aid inthe electrical management of the Freeman, and thecall of the former to another field, we have not enjoyedthe some extent of service, in this determentas in former years. The deficiency, however, theExecutive Committee have endeavored to make upby holding a series of convention themselves invarious parts of the State lying adjacent to Philadelphia,and the neighboring portion of New Jersey.These Conventions have been well attended, andhave afforded satisfactory evidence of there usefulness. Our weekly paper the Pennsylvania Freeman,owing to its increased circulation, and the additionalability with it has been edited renderedeven more than its wonted service to the cause.Cyrus M. Burleigh and Mary Grew have had thechief editorial changes of it, and the ability withwhich, they have performed the duties of theiroffice, has been a subject of common remark. Thecirculation of the paper has continued stability toincrease, till the number of copies now issuedreaches nearly two thousand. In addition to theFreeman, an average of about 500 copies of theAnti-Slavery Standard, the organ of the AmericanSociety, and an invaluable auxiliary in the cause,have been subscribed for and circulated over thesame ground. In enumerating the various evidence of our advancement,we have alluded particularly to the recentdisruption of the old political parties, and theincipient formation of a new one, based partially onthe anti-slavery principle, and in speaking of this,we have expressed ourselves in terms of sanguineexpectation The facts in the case we believe willjustify a good degree of hope, but this hope shouldbe qualified by no inconsiderable apprehensionA political party in any country, no matter howelevated may be its object, needs to be watchedwith great cure; in this country, such a party,based, as it must be under our present bond ofUnion, on fraud and injustice, needs to be watchedwith especial jealousy. It must be essentially corruptfrom its origin, and therefore especially liableto perversion. In the present case, the party, cominginto popular favor, gives its consent to the existenceof slavery with all horrors within itspresent State limits; it only profession to be opposedto its further extension, Our hope arms that it willperform more than it promise; that it will notonly resist the extension, but advocate the extinctionof slavery. These hopes however, may bedisappointed. Sudden accession to popular favor,with all its temptation, may check the generousimpulses, and change back the half-formed purposeof the who have now the control of this movement,or may introduce into its direction othersmotives than a desire for their own aggrandizement. Insuch a case, it is easy to conceive that this newparty might become one of the most powerful conservatorsof the evil it was hoped it would cuss,and the deadliest foe of those who are laboring forits abolition. Such a result would not be withoutabundant president in the anal of political history. While, therefore, abolitionists rejoice in thepresent uprising of the North, and hope much fromthe resistance it will offer to the usurpations ofslavery, let not their hopes be too confident, or theirrejoicings unmingled with apprehension. Andabove all, let no one be carried away from hisprinciples by the current this popular movement,Now, as much as ever do we need to stand by ourprinciples; now, more than ever, do we see thewisdom of their adoption. They are not only justin themselves, but their maintenance is in the highestdegree, expedient. They will soon we doubtnot, prove even to throe who are now skeptical, tohave been the salvation of the Anti-Slavery cause.Nothing but a deep conviction of the unrighteousnessof the Federal compact, and the guilt of givingit there support, can be relied on to keep abolitionistin times of high political excitement, when anopportunity is afford of gaining an apparent advantagesto the cause from being swept completelyfrom there mornings, and lost in the vortex. Theprobability now is, that those who separated fromus eight years ago, and embodied themselves in apolitical party for the promotion of the cause, willin there organic capacity, in a few months, andperhaps in a few days, be swept from existence,and not have even a name to live. If we had listenedsame policy, the Anti-Slavery movement as adistinctive origination, would cause to have abeing, and the hopes of the slave be doomed to anindefinite postponement. Let us be admonishedby these reflections. Let not be too impatientfor the final consummation. It will come as soonas the people are prepared for it; no sooner. Inthe meantime our duty—our mission, is plain; it isto abide by our principle, and, rejecting all politicalcontrivance and temporary expedients, to laboron in the steady use of our well approved moralmeans, till the public mind shall become saturatedwith Anti-Slavery truth and public sentiment completelyrevolutionized. Then the day will be athand—and not till them, when the people of theNorth shall be released from the guilt of supportingslavery, and the bondmen of the South deliveredfrom its chains. Remarks on the tepees embraced is the Report,were made by Edward Needles, Thomas Earlie,Wm. P. Powell of N.Y., James N. Buffum of Mass.,and J.W.

Lucretia Mott, Benjamin C. Bacon, Edward M.Davis, Lowland Johnson, Issac Winslow, BenjaminRush Plumly. The resolution were discussed by parker Pillsbury,C. Darlington, W.W. Brooms, T. Whitson,Charles Lenox Remond, of Massachusetts, LucretinMon, James Trainer, and J. Miller McKim After being amended by striking out a paragraphsin one of the resolutions, they were adopted an follows: 1. Resolved, That she indications of advancementmade by the Anti-Slavery cause every wherethroughout the country in a high degree choosing,and arise in the lively hope that the day ofits final triumph is not for in the future. 2. Resolved, That while we rejoice in the signsof the times, and in the conviction of our ultimatevictory, there is still in the moral and political aspectsof society, and the events which are everyday transpiring around us, too much evidence ofthe giant strength and all-pervading power ofslavery, to allow as to indulge this feeling permanently,or to relax for one moment our efforts.  3. Resolved, That the fact intimated in theannual report, that the signs of Anti-Slavery progressare less cheering in the religious sects thanin other departments of society, and that thechurches and clergy compare unfavorably in thisrespect with the politicians and political parties ofthe country, is significant of the character of ourprevailing religion, and justifies the estimate putupon its ministers by the friends of freedom. 4. Resolved, That the nomination, by the Democraticparty, of General Case for the Presidency—a man who has shown himself by his sycophancyand crawling servility to the slave power, to beutterly recreant to all just, moral and politicalprinciples—proves the so-called Democracy ofthe country, a show in its professions, andin its actions one of the deadliest foes to freedom. 5. Resolved, That the Whig party is no betterthan its rival; and has so proved itself by the nominationfor the Presidential chair, of a man onlydistinguished by his extensive slave possessions,and his achievements in wars waged for the preservationand extension of slavery. 6. Resolved, That a patty that can profess to beopposed to slavery—as a large portion of the Whigparty does—and then nominate for the head of thegovernment a large slaveholder, and a man whosewhole interests are identified with the slave system—that can profess to be opposed to lavishing politicalhonors on military chieftains, and then seek toelevate a military chieftain to the highest honor inthe gift of the people—that can declare theiropposition to all wars of aggression, and especiallythe late infamous war of aggression against Mexico,and then nominate for the chief office of the government,a man who has confessedly doe morethan any other to render that war popular, is a partywithout consistency, without principle, and withoutany claim to the respect, such less the support ofany true friend of freedom.  [Resolutions 7, 8, 9 and 10 were given inlast week's Liberator.] 11. Revolved, That this Society places no confidenceon any measures for the abolition of slaveryat the South, or the release of the people of theNorth from the guilt of its support, that are notdirected primarily to a change if public sentiment;that in its belief a radical change of public sentimentis all that is needed to the accomplishment,in their proper succession, of both of these events;and that the only means to be relied on for effectingthis change is the dissemination of Anti-Shiverytruth and its consistent maintenance on the part ofabolitionists. Then adjourned to 2 1-2 o'clock, P.M. The President in the Chair. The following resolution was offered by SamuelRhoads; debuted by Thomas Hambleton,—Taylor of Virginia/Lucretia Mott, E.M. Davis, C.L. Remond, Eli Hambleton, George W. Taylor,James N. Buffum. Thos. Whitson, and W.W.Brown, and adopted, viz: Resolved, That the members of tins Convention,and abolitionists generally, in declaring that theywill have 'no union with slaveholders,' do in effectannounce to the world that they will not contributetheir aid to support shivery; consequently, consistencysincerity and duty require that they abstainfrom the use of the products of slave labor. The following resolution, reported by the BusinessCommittee, was then taken up and adopted,and the Fair Committee were authorized to appointthe committee provided for in the resolution,and to announce their names in the PennsylvaniaFreeman: Resolved, That the annual Fair held in Philadelphiaunder the care of a committee of the PhiladelphiaFemale Anti-Slavery Society,' commendsitself to the continued support of abolitionists inthe city and country; and that a committee be appointed,of friends in the different neighborhoods,to co-operate with the committee of the PhiladelphiaSociety in holding the Fair at the close of theyear. The following resolutions were then reported bythe Business Committee, viz: Resolved, That to the anti-slavery movement,more than to any other influence, is owing the quietendurance with which the slaves of our SouthernStates have borne the many wrongs which arecontinually inflicted upon them; and that thisopinion is corroborated by the Diet that no attemptat insurrection has been made since the organizationof the American Ami-Slavery Society, (thoughbefore that event such efforts were mode.) as wellas by the uniform testimony of fugitive slavesthemselves, that the knowledge, imperfect thoughit be, which is extensively diffused among them, ofour efforts for their deliverance, is one of thestrongest motives which influence them to anunresisting endurance of their sufferings. Resolved, That this Society sympathize deeplywith those noble men Drayton and Sayres, of theSchooner Pearl, in their generous effort for theliberation of slaves held by laws sanctioned andsustained by the people of this nation at large; andthat we view with inter detestation, the unflinchingdetermination exhibited by their persecutors toconsign them for life to the dungeons of the capitalof this model republic. On motion of Lucretia Mott, it was ordered toamend the above resolution by inserting a clauseexpressive of the deep sympathy of this Societywith Samuel D. Burris, now undergoing the penaltyof a similar offence in one of the fails of the Stateof Delaware. The motion met the unanimous assent of themeeting. Resolved, That this Society cordially recommendthe National Anti-Slavery Standard, PennsylvaniaFreemen, and Liberator, to the patronage of all, asefficient and uncompromising advocates of unadulteratedAnti-Slavery doctrines; and that everyperson interested, be requested to act as an agentto increase the number of subscribers to theseeffective instrumentalities in the cause of theslave. The first of these resolutions was opposed byWins W. Brown, L. Mott, L. Coates, P. Pillsbury,and Thos. Earle, and rejected. The next was advocated by J.N. Buffum, andC.L. Remond, and adopted. And the last, after some pertinent remarks byRowland Johnson and Parker Pillsbury, waspassed. The following resolutions were offered by theBusiness Committee; the first three on their ownbehalf, and the remaining two on behalf ofothers, but for want of time were not acted upon. Resolved, That the working-men of the Northhave submitted to be taxed fur slavery, in thefollowing, among other ways: Louisiana was purchased at fifteen millions ofdollars, for a slave State. Florida for five millions, and for the same purposeFor butchering and banishing the SemmoleIndians, were paid forty millions more. For theinvasion and conquest of Mexico, one hundredmillions, more or less, besides immense sums toslaveholders for their strayed slaves. Resolved, That to accomplish these objects, theSouth has been permitted to fill almost every highoffice with men of her own selection, usuallyslaveholders, While the North bears most of theburden of expenses in sustaining the Government. Resolved, That if Northern working-men, or anypart of them, to the insult, added to injury, of beingcalled,—as they often are at the South,—'peasants','menials', and 'lower orders.' and even to be toldthat they 'have no right to vote' at all; if they willquietly sit to these outrages, then indeed arethey most illustrious examples of non-resistingChristianity, or else, what slaveholders call thema degraded and interior class of beings, fit only tobe slaves. 'peasants','menials' have no right to vote  Whereas, one of the main purposes of our Fathersin forming this government, was to securethe blessings of liberty, for themselves and theirposterity, end, whereas, they and their successorshave, from that day to this, proclaimed this countryan asylum for the oppressed of all nations. Therefore, Resolved, That consistency further requiresthat ovary effort to strike off the chains ofoppression, no less in this country than else where,should be bailed with such cheers of encouragement,as will make the ,and the oppressed feel that  glorious,and that the approbation his.    Resolved, That although this society may sanction or encourage political action as a of abolishing shivery; we rtheless to those who do use  elective function at thecoming election, to make their votes tell  theextension of the informal system.

 The undersigned  desiring the abolitionof Slavery have been  by the strength of theirwith  in consider what means  may be foundsufficient for the accomplishment of this great andholy object. They had that slavery exists through the , the wardi, the hypocrisyof the people If the  could be mademore  enlightenedand true to its own political and religiousprinciples, the work were done. Until enough nobilityof spirit can be awakened in the land to makethe man, the farmer, the lawyer the is, the merchant and the politician willing to renouncetheir hopes of worldly success and see theirrespective careers of individual advancement closedup, apparently forever, by their allegiance to Freedom;—to make the women of the land feel themselvesdisgraced by their indifference to each causeas this;—to make the Christians and the citizens ofthe land willing to bear the suffering and tedium. consequentupon an  to right against law andcustom;—until this can be accomplished, the Southernslaveholders are upheld in their sin by the powerfulsupport of Christiana fellowship, social sanction,and civil participation.              We determine, therefore, to strike al once at theroot of slavery by appealing to the hearts and consciencesof men and withdrawing, these allegiancefrom such shameful cruelty and wrong, by the continualpresentation of the paramount claims of freedomand humanity. Union being; strength that fastdecides us to co-operate with any whose principlesprove them to be trustworthy; who make the abolitionof slavery their primary object; and who, inaddition to their honesty of purpose have sense andnity enough to make them ante co-adjutors, bysecuring them from becoming the prey of the shellfisheryof hypocritical adventures that every moral revolutioncalls forth. We find such a sufficient andtrustworthy body now here but in the American Anti Slavery.Society. Years of color observation of itsrighteous principles, and uncompromising practicalworkings, assure us that it has the elements of success.It continually sends forth lecturers to enforcethe first principles of justice and humanity amongthe people, and in few years as found thereby tohave exercised a controlling influence for goodthroughout the country. It declares the courseand bends the policy of every political party; and,speaking as it does- from a height above their selfishpersonal struggles, its words of everlasting truth areheard, and more and more obeyed. While callingon all to unite with it it, has ever, by the energy andrectitude of its progress, been free without license,and elective without invid. It is not toomuch to say is its praise, that its cause and its courserepel all but the wise, the good and the bold fromactive co-operation with it, and brand with dishonorthe hand that approaches it to make it the instrumentof any selfish purpose. It has no local attachmentsno prtisan sectarian partialities, no biddenaim, no double purpose; while, at the suchtime, every observer notices how happily its laborsprepare the way for every good work: for, thoughspecific in its object, its great principle of immediateindividual reform, without awaiting the gradualistsof party politics, legislative action and judicial decisionis one of the universal application.    immediateindividual reform This there fore, is the mode of operation, whichcommands itself to our reason and our feelings. Theagents and friends that such as association of necessitydraws forth, are the ones that we wish to sustainThe periodicals that such an association employsare the ones that we wish to circulate. In the councilsof such a body, where all persons have equalrights of membership, the whole collective energyand judgment are constantly in use, and the chancesand means of success consequently doubted. whole Hence we find it to be our duty, in preparing forthe FIFTEENTH NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVARYBAZAAR, to commence in FANEUIL HALL,BOSTON, on Thursday DECEMBER 21st, to devotethe funds then raised, to sustain the AMERICANANTILSLAVERY SOCIETY, in its sacredwork of moral agitation and revolution in be half ofthe enslaved; and we confidently appeal to all goodhearts EVERY WHERE in aid of so noble an enterprice.

 Many have been the phases of Pro-Slavery. Likethe poor, we have, and ever have bad, it with us.It is an essential element in the diagnosis of slavery.As inseparable from it as the symptom from thedisease, of which it is a part, as well as a sign.As long as that fatal disorder is permitted to revelin the veins of our body politic, of our social andreligious system, so long will this indication of itsexistence endure. The disease may be at the heartwhile the symptom is on the surface or at the extremities;but they are still correlatives, and dependthe one on the other. The symptom is ever changingits character and shifting its place; but it isnone the less the sympathetic attendant of the diseaseWe may modify its appearance or alter itsposition by empiric nostrums; but there is onlyone radical cure for it, and that is the extinction ofthe disease it indicates. Pro-slavery pursues Slaveryas its shade. The shadow may change itsshape a thousand times, according to the altitudeof the sun and the relations of the objects amongwhich it falls; but it can cease from the earth onlyby the disappearance of the black horror whichprojects it. diagnosis It has been curious and edifying to watch thegradual changes which have come over the manifestationof the pro-slavery heart of the Nation,from time to time, for the last eighteen years. Firstof all, it rejoiced in a supreme and profound contemptfor the ridiculous assaults of the vulgar andfanatical Abolitionists upon the Sanctified SlaveSystem. It hardly deigned to know of the existenceof themselves, or of their agitation. TheColonization Scheme having received the seal ofthe slaveholders' approval, was as near an approachto an interference with Slavery as it ventured tomake. A general and genuine indifference as tothe condition of Slavery sod the wrongs of theSlaves, pervaded society. People had almost forgottenthem; or if they ever thought of them, itwas only as appendages to the glory and dignity ofthe elegant gentlemen and ladies who condescendedevery summer to be entertained at their expense.If one of the slaves in attendance on one of theseNorthern progresses presumed to secrete himselflawyers of the highest respectability, and men ofmore than common humanity in common matters,thought it not shame to assist in the hunt for him.The humanity of the negro, whether bond or free,was scarcely recognized. But the South was wiser than the North, andthe Slaveholders knew by an instinct surer thanreason, that Slavery, to be safe, must he let aloneThat it breathed upon, the charm would be broken.That, if the stone was thrown, the Giant must die.They neither fell, nor affected to feel, any contemptfor the sayings and doings of the Abolitionists.They called upon their. Northern allies toprove their fidelity, by putting down this Agitation;and they enforced their requisition with indefinitethreats of Dissolving the Union, and with morespecific ones of diverting Southern trade into otherchannels. Then was the Era of Public Meetingsin all the great cities, at which the chiefest menwere set to perform the rites of homage to Slavery;which were duly and necessarily followedby propitiatory sacrifices of public peace, privateproperty and personal rights, offered by the sacerdotalhands of Mobs. There was but one voiceheard from the high places, from Legislatures,Courts of Justice, Exchanges, Presses and Pulpits,one denouncing the Abolitionists and deprecatingtheir Agitation. Even the guarded mid qualifiedtestimony of Channing was almost more than mencould bear. And when John Quincy Adams wasengaged in the first desperate encounters of hisstruggle with the Slave Power for the simple rightof Petition, knowing men shook their heads andsaid—'The old man will find himself expelled, yet,if he is not careful!' And the shake of the headbeing interpreted, signified, 'and serve him righttoo!' And then Pro-Slavery began to rage in theChurches, and the Ecclesiastical traffic with theSouth, in Theology and Ministers, to be vindicated.Then the ecclesiastical thumb-screws were appliedto ministers und church-members, suspected ofthis taint of heresy, which resulted in New-Organizationand Third Party. And so the everlastingpresence of Pro-Slavery bus been continued, inone shape or another, unto this day Still theshape it now wears is very different from what ithas been at different points of its history. Its substanceis the same, hut its dress is changed. Ithas had at least to assume virtue, if it had it not,and to pay the tribute of hypocrisy which Vice isforced to render to Virtue. Thus the Stale and theChurch have endeavored to write themselves downAnti-Slavery in resolutions, while they were votingfor the most incorrigible slavocrats for office, andgiving the right hand of religious fellowship toreverend and devout man thieves. There is, probably,as much genuine, hearty, cordial Pro-Slaverynow as there ever was; but it has, at least, toput on the garb and air of Anti-Slavery, and to tryto look as much like it as possible. It is from theindifferent, the thoughtless, the inconsiderate, theimperfectly informed, that the ranks of the Abolitionistshave been recruited, and it is among suchthat the change has been brought about. This change, such as has been wrought, andthat now in progress, the Abolitionists claim as thejust and necessary fruit of their agitation. Theirimportunity which would make itself heard, andtheir assiduity in providing the people with factsand arguments, and, as it were, compelling theirattention, have enlightened those who only neededlight, and made those who prefer darkness, for veryshame, assume the port and affect the air of thechildren of light. Multitudes actually are, and manymore pretend to be, brought up to the point ofopinion and progression which the Abolitionistsoccupied when they were mobbed a dozen or fifteenyears ago. The successive developmentswhich they have made as to the relations of slaveryto the Church and the Suite, and of the consequentduty of the enemies of Slavery, have been successivetouchstones to try the temper of the publicmind, at different points of time, and to bring intoaction whatever latent pro-slavery it contained.The Abolitionists have not created the pro-slaveryelement which has manifested itself in variousways, from time to time,—they have only elicitedit.  theSlavery slavery of We desolate as  slavery .          

 Dr. Beth W. Fowle—Dear sir:—This may certifythat I am about seventy-five years of age; was bornand have always resided in this town. In October,1845 I took cold, and for six months was affectedwith the influence, and the worst cough I have everexperienced during my whole life. Myself andfriends had strong doubts of my ever recovering. Iget a bottle of  Syrup—it me no good.I then applied to a physician, who prescribed for meseveral times, but did not cure me. At last my physicianadvised me to take Dr. Wistar's celebratedBalsam of Wild Cherry, which was performed somany remarkable cures. I did so and I believe thatsaved my life; my cough left we entirely when Ihad taken a single bottle. I am now enjoying goodhealth. If I ever again have a similar attack, or anyof my family, I shall immediately revert to Dr. Wistar'sBalaam of Wild Cherry. The physician whorecommended this Balsam to me, was induced to doso from his own personal observations and experiencein using it. One very strong case of care of a youngman occurred in this immediate vicinity, of whichDr. Heman informed me.   EPHRAIM SANDERS. None genuine signed I BUTTS on thepper.  For sale by SETH W.

 The advice by the as the the opinion we have been  to the and the result of the  movement inIreland. It is  and and most of the other head was made against the government forces, andthe preparations of the insurgents appear to havebeen as imperfect and insufficient as these of thegovernment were complete and thoroughly appointed.It was a most hopeless affair,—and a hopeless insurrection,especially when a deliberate and not asudden one, is a very wicked thing. Fur it disturbsthe peace and happiness of a nation, sad endangersthe lives sad liberties of impulsive and imperfectlyinformed people, with so justifying prospect of anybeneficial result. We do not believe that the YoungIreland leaders had say design originally of bringingabout the slate of things in which they have justfound themselves. But they played with edge-tools,and have eat their fingers. They talked about fighting,and were taken at their word. And when thetime of fighting came, they found that armies are notraised, disciplined, provisioned and maitioned bytalk. And fighting bring new reduced to an exacscience, there was nothing left for them but to givein.          We are sorry for these Hotspurs who have gotthemselves into this scrape, and heartily wish themwell out of it. AS to the American Sympathizers,said to be under arrest, they will receive but littlesympathy in return for that they went to show.They are only a grade better than the patriots, Irishand American, who stay quietly in this country, andtry to fin the fires of a bungling rebellion, and manufacturelying news to extort a few more farthingsfrom the excitable emigrants from-Ireland. And weare sorry for this vain attempt, because it will retardthe day of such red roe and amelioration as Englishlegislation can afford, it must come, but whathas happened neither produces the state of thingsnor the slate of mind, to hasten it. But though therebellion is crushed for the time being, the discontentswhich underlie the heaving masses remain.The volcano may be quiet, but the central firesare still at work. There is no cure for mis-government,but good government,—no remedy for injustice,but justice. Three things the Irish must andwill have, in the same proportion at least as theirfellow-subjects of Great Britain. But the way toachieve them is that indicated by the great O'Connell.Unarmed, peaceful agitation, acting on publicopinion, and through public opinion on Parliamentis the certain weapon of this victory. It is a Weaponwhich spikes cannon and turns aside the edge of thesword. No army is a match for it. No governmentcon resist it.—Q.

 We made a suggestion, some time since, either inthis paper or the Standard, that the Wings wouldnever elect a President till they had found a candidatethat could neither read nor write. Or, at least,until they could treat him as the undutiful fathersand guardians in plays do their daughters and wards,and lock bun up from the use of pen, ink and paperThis last course they pursued as to Harrison, and sothey were aide to elect him. But Mr. Clay 'played theRoman fool' and fell upon his pen, murdering him-selfand all the hopes of his party with a most ruthlesssuicide. And now General Taylor shows themost rabid symptoms of this epistotomania, threateninga melancholy end to himself and the Whigs. epistotomania Besides all his former letters, and his cool permissionto the Wings, to elect him, provided it were notas a Whig, he wrote a letter of three lines, awhilesince, to a Mr. Lippard, stating that he accepted thePhiladelphia nomination, as he had all others offeredto him, and as he would have accepted that ofBaltimore had it been offered! He doesn't wantto he President, not he! But he is too obliging aa gentleman to refuse any invitation from any body.He accepted the Whig nomination as Benedick mar-Beatrice,'out of great persuasion and partly to saveher life!' And the poor Whigs were fain to havebeen on his own terms. But now comes the hardestrub of all. He has given them a fresh proof ofwhat they hive to expect after matrimony. Andthey are no Petrucos to tame such a Katherine.  A portion of the most fanatical of the Slaveholders,Slaveholders of the Slaveholders, dissatisfiedwith the nomination of Cass and of Fillmore, held ameeting at Charleston, and nominated Gen Tayloras President, and GEN. BUTLER, as Vice President!And this nomination Gen. Taylor ACCEPTS!The Atlas and Daily Advertiser publish the correspondence,and the Courier Taylor's answer, withouta word of comment. No doubt they would be wellcontent to purchase the privilege of pulling theirshouts into the national trough al the cost of Fillmore,though it will not do to say so. But the letteris like to make trouble in New York, where theWhigs look upon it as an intuit to Fillmore, and itmay result in the nomination of Clay. The followingis Mr. Pringle's letter to Gen.

 DEAR FRIEND:-Believing you to be Interested inregard to the periodical denominated the Prisoner'sFriend, we venture to ask your special attentionTo a debt now connected with the office. Detail isunnecessary. To express regret on our part for suchan appeal is wholly uncalled for. Facts are readyfor those who need them. EAR RIEND Having made every exertion, we now ask thefriends of the cause to make one more effort. Thereis now due about $500 A mortgage is on the typesand type plates of the last work, 'voices fromPrison.' The amount of the mortgage is $400,00.The owner of it promises to give $40,00 if raisedwithin two months. Our own health and other reasonsprevent us from raising the whole amount.What will you do? Shall the work cease? Shallthe only press in the world, devoted to Prison Reformbe stopped? Several friends say no. What courseis  then, is a question. It has been proposed tohave a FAIR. The time is appointed. It will be onthe FIRST AND SECOND days in SEPTEMBERnext, in Boston, at  Hall.    The time is short The mortgage must be paidwithin that time. We cannot ask the friend whoholds it to wait any longer. Already  one timebeen set, and for our own saks, the amount must beinst. We cannot labor under the pecuniary difficulty.  for our own saks The friends must not expect any thing from thesubscription list of the paper. We freely give thatto support the periodical. It needs the whole amount.And a great work is gained in any Reform, if a presscan sustain itself. It is believed that after this yeara sufficient amount will be raised from the paper tomeet the ordinary expenses. Of course, voluntarycontributions will be wanted yet for some time. We invite the friends to rally once more. Severalhave already commenced the work of preparation. An interesting incident is connected with the FairJOHN HOWARD, the great philanthropist, wasborn Sept. 2nd, 1796. In doing then for the Prisoner'sFriend, at the Fair, we are celebrating the birth ofthat distinguished man, who gave his life to the greatwork of visiting prisons. He was truly the Prisoner'sFriend. To add to the interest of the occasion, it has beenproposed so have a FLORAL FESTIVAL, consistingof SOROS and DANCES by the Children Tocarry out this plan, we invite  to send theirchildren on Saturday afternoon, the second day ofSeptember, Howard a Birth Day, the second day ofthe Fair. It will be seen that this will be a very favorabletime on account of the schools. OROS ANCES  Will you then send either mercy or goods? Andwhatever is sent will be faithfully applied to relievethe Prisoner's Friend, and for as other object whatever.Every thing must be directed to this office, 40Cornhill. and for as other object whatever.

 MR. GARAISON: R. ARAISON DEAR SIR—Being a stranger to you, and neverbefore having written for publication, you may perhaps deem some apology necessary for intruding onyour time and patience; but the scenes that I havebeheld enacted this day in East Harwich are a sufficientapology for every individual in the communitythat has the least regard far the rights of man, theliberty of the press, freedom of thought and speech,the right of free discussion, unterrified by mobocracy,or that has the least iota of humanity in or abouthim, to raise his voice in tones of thunder in condemnationof such an outrage. Being one of thosewhose life is on the ocean wave, principally, mymeans of information have been very limited of acquiringa knowledge of the anti-slavery cause, andI listened to-day for the first time to an exposition ofits principles from the lips of number bf championsof freedom, among whom were Parker Pillsbury,S.S. Foster, Lucy Stone, and W.W. Brown; andfor the first time in my life I heard truth proclaimedfearlessly and publicly, regardless of the anathemasof the churches and clergy of our land. Being attachedto a vessel here, and at leisure, I availed myselfof the opportunity of attending the anti-slaverymeeting, and moat richly was I repaid. There Iheard the principles of Anti-Slavery fully, fairly andhonorably discussed, and there too I saw the principlesof Northern as well as Southern slavery fullyand practically carried out. EAR IR Demonstrations of a mob were manifest quite earlyin the day, but they did not rally sufficient force tocommence operations till near the close of the afternoonmeeting; and then commenced a scene such asI was unwilling to believe human beings, wearingthe human form, capable of perpetrating, until convincedby ocular demonstration. Cries of 'Haulthem out,' 'Down with them,' 'Tar and featherhim,' 'Ride him on a rail,' 'Pass out that nigger,'with other choice selections from their vocabulary,were preliminaries. Then came the rush;—thespeakers were crowded or dragged from the stand,women and helpless children rushed over and troddenunder foot, the speakers knocked down, theirclothes torn, their bodies bruised and beaten, andthe chance for their lives, I think, would have beensmall, had it not been for the most strenuous effortsof a few friend to protect them. As they were separated,I only had a chance to observe their treatmentof Mr. Foster. I have heard of hell and devils,and the scene before me had a strong tendency toinduce me to believe that hell had disgorged itself,and that all' the devils were let loose to destroy him.I saw him surrounded by (I should think) at leastone hundred, each vieing with the other whichshould injure him most, and he not so much as liftinga finger in self-defence. Add to this the yelling,screaming, shouting and huzzaing of a hundred ortwo infuriated rowdies, mingled with the screamsand cries of as many women and children, breakingthe calm stillness of a Sabbath afternoon, and youthen have but a faint idea of it. It was to me asolemn and affecting sight—it brought vividly tomy mind the last tragical scene in the te our Savior,when surrounded by the rabble, and with shoutsof 'Crucify him, crucify him.' I saw Mr. Fostersafe from their clutches, and then left, sick at heart atwhat I had seen, and I thought if ever I could bejustified in using the Pharisee's prayer, it was onthis occasion, for I mentally thanked God that, badas I was, I was not like these men, and that I livedin a community where the rights of man are moreregarded and better protected than I think they arehere.  I have penned these lines in a hasty, unconnectedmanner, to express my feelings in common with othersof my seafaring brethen who were witnesses ofthis shameful outrage, but who are happy that theirlot is cast in other places. Yours, respectfully, BENJAMIN F. HATHAWAY. THE COLONIZATION SOCIETY, —c We ask a carefulreading for the article which we give this week,on the Colonization Society and its Settlements inLiberia. It is a terrible exposure of the deceptionwhich that Society has been practicing upon theAmerican public, including many (doubtless) benevo'entminds. Such, at least, can give no farther confidenceor support to it.—M. HE OLONIZATION OCIETY

 We know that we have ever been more astonishedsmall faith as we have had in the Colonizationscheme than at the detailed, and apparently trustworthystatements, respecting the colony of Liberiaand its officers, recently published in the New York DayBook. The editor of that journal, and the author ofthe statements referred to, is Dr. Bacon, (a brother,we understand, of Rev. Leonard Bacon of New Haven,)who resided for some time in Liberia, as physicianof the colony. We have, for several weeks,been desirous of laying this subject before the readersof the Liberator, but the pressure of other matter,same of it already long delayed, has prevented. New York DayBook. The articles of Dr. Bacon are too long for insertionsin full, but we propose giving selections so copiousas will enable our readers to possess themselves ofall the material facts. When this is done, we thinkno one of them will consider Dr. B's language toostrong, when be speaks of the' monstrous impostureof Colonization,' or blame him for giving' a thoroughexposure of individual characters, in connexion withthis scheme of fraud.' We have street out an occasionalexpression or epithet, is making the fallowingquotations, by which, however, the author's meaningsis in no which obscured or weakened. The followingdescribes Dr. Bason's first introduction to J.B. Pinney,afterwards Governor(!) of Liberia. Governor(!) In 1836, the editor of the Day-Book, than makingarrangements to go to West Africa, in order to investigatethoroughly the condition of the Liberiancolony and the operations and prospects of theColonization scheme, (of which be then was, andfrom his early youth had been en enthusiastic admirerand advocate,) was introduced at his brother'shouse to a person called John B. Pinney, whohad but a few days before returned from Liberia,where he had been at first abandoning a Presbyterianmissionary, and then, abandoning that sacredcause, had become a secular agent of the ColonizationSociety, with better pay, and employmentmuch better suited to his moral character. Day-Book * * * Being very desirous of acquiringthe fullest possible knowledge of every fact concerningthe Liberian colony, and considering himselfeminently fortunate in such an opportunity toknow the truth in a matter upon which a greatpurpose of life, and even life itself depended, hemade this man his friend, as he supposed,—at anyrate treated him like a friend,—introduced him togentlemen, passed many hours in conversationwith him, for weeks seeking to draw from him thetruth in regard to the condition of Liberia, thecharacter of the colonists, the difficulties of colonization,and the ultimate feasibility of the originalscheme. The behavior of Pinney, while at New Haven,was such as to lead to a suspicion that he was insane;indeed, a rumor of that kind had been circulatedthere. A few months afterwards, the writer of this wasin Africa; end from the first day of his lending onthat continent till be left it, be had evidence that allwhich he had so studiously learned from J.B. Pineywas a mass of the most absurd and abominablefalsehood. One of the first things that he heardthere in speaking of Pinney Was, that be had beennotoriously actually insane during a large portionof the time when there resident,—that be had beencarefully watched for fear that he might do himself,some mischief Friends and foes were alike agreedthat be was a thoroughly insane man. first * * * * The writer has now norecollection of any particular is which Pinney toldhim the truth in regard to Liberia, in reply to hisanxious personal inquiries before going to Africa,or in published statements read as before mentionedin Africa. That many unimportant particularswere true is of course probable, but in all mattersessential to a correct impression of the conditionand character of Liberia and the colonists, thefalsehood was uniform. The whole of the testimonywas recollected only as a he in the generalpurport, and is all particulars of any importance.On this subject there was no differ lice at opinionamong people in Africa acquainted with his testimony.The only question was as to the moralor intellectual causes of this monstrous mendacity. The following affords glance at the condition,customs and comforts of the Colony, and shows whatopportunity Dr. Bacon had to become acquainted withthe same. By a singular coincidence, it so happens thatexactly nine years ago this afternoon,—July 11,1839—the editor at the Day Book 'left the colony'of Liberia for the last time, after a residence atMonrovia of seven months, and in other parts ofwhat is Called Liberia of about a year, in other partsof West Africa of a little more then a year. Hefirst landed in Liberia, February 4, 1837; and consequentlythe whole period between his first andlast Sight of that very interesting country, was twoyears, five months and one week. At several limesafter censing to reside there, he visited Monrovia,and made careful observations of the condition ofthe people. He was always welcomed by themwith strong expressions of delight, and of hopesthat he had come back to remain and resume themedical charge at the colony; and after his departure,he was followed to the shore, with loud regretsthat he would not stay, and with earnest entreatiesthat he would change his determination. Especially was this feeling manifested when heleft 'the colony' nine years ago to-day, when meof the colonists followed him through the bushesdown to the very bench where he look the boatwhich conveyed him to the ship—beseeching himto stay and take care of them when they were sickand not leave them to die, us they feared they shouldwith the next attack of the dreadful diseases ofthat pestilential climate. Some of these men added,as many do when they see any body leaving thecolony and returning to America—'Take me withyou. I can't live in this miserable place. I shalldie here. O! Doctor lake me with you, and I willbe your servant or do anything you say.' He neverheard more piteous expressions of despairing misery,or more heart-rending cries of sorrow thanthose which mingled in the reluctant adieus of thosepoor exiles longing to return to their native land,the land of Slavery.  When he first left the colony and terminated hisresidence at Monrovia be, did so simply becausehis usefulness as Colonial physician was obstructedand nullified by want of food sufficient to keep hisconvalescent patients from starvation, and even tosupport himself in health and vigor, and also bythe cruel treatment which the sick emigrants receivedfrom the colonists, and by the nightly robberiesperpetrated on their little stock of necessariesby the thievish Liberians. He was himselfrobbed in repeated instances; and his native servantshearten and abused is the most shameful mannerby the colonists, without possibility of redress,so that it was difficult to seen the attendancenecessary to his business and his subsistencewhen sick, he found that his orders in regard tothe invalids were countermanded—and his treatmentthwarted by the negro agents of the Society,in consequence of which, several of his patientsdied white he was too much enfeebled by fever toleave the house to attend to them. Dr. Bacon, having been accused by J.B. Pinne,of 'intimacy with slaveholder' while resident atLiberia, thus turns the tables upon the colonizationSociety and its agents; and here we shall find ittestified is the most positive manner, that a largepart of the trade of Liberia is carried on with theslave traders, that the present secretary of the Colonywas for a long time in the employ of a slave-trader,that J.J. Robert himself (Governor of theColony) has afforded extensive facilities to that trade,and that the Liberian colonists themselves hold staves!If Dr. B's. statements are at all to be credited, (andhe has put them forward openly and circumstantially,)then is the whole schema of the Colonization societyand its settlements in Africa, one of greatestfrand ever practiced upon this community or anyother. largepart of the trade of Liberia is carried on with theslave traders and that the Liberian colonists themselves hold staves!  Respecting the charge above mentioned. Dr. B.says:— As to 'intimacy with slaveholders,' his acquaintancewith that class of people was made, withoutany overture on his part, through the unmaskedagency of the colonists and Colonizationists. JohnN. Lewis, (one of the Liberians now in this city,and Secretary of the colony), in July, 1837, was inthe employ of Pedro Blanca, the great Specialslave-trader at Galio has about sixty males fromMonrovia, and within the territory of the colonyof Liberia. He was Blnco's store-keeper at Monrovia,and received a large amount of money fromhim in compensation services in connection withthe slave trade, and for rent of store hired of himby Blanco. There facts are as notorious that 'J.B. Planey's article in the Commercial Advertiser admitsthem. While the brig Ivanhoe of Bosten wasdischarging a large carge of tobacco belonging toBlanco, at Monrovia, (which was then a depot ofthe slave-traders, and quite indispensable to theirtraffic on account of the badness of the surf at Galinhas in that year,) John N. Lewis had at his Lousefor well educated and highly accomplished Spanishgentleman, about thirty years old, namedThomas Rodriguez Boron. John N. Len is broughtthis gentlemanly slave-trader to 'Dr. B's house,and introduced him, of his own accord withoutbeing invited by 'Dr. B.' The new acqusintationproved very agreeable. 'Don Thomas,' as he was called,was a very thoroughly educated man having beeninstructed at one of the military colleges of France,in which the late Duke d'Orleans and Duke de Nemourswere his fellow students. He had subsequentlybeen an officer of dragoons, in the Spanisharmy, and served in the invasion of Tampico. Hewas a man of extensive reading in the literatureof other countries as well as his own, and spokefour or five European languages. He converted inEnglish with great fluency, ease and propriety.Such a man's company was a great comfort in sucha place, where the society of intelligent or gentlemanly people was not even to be looked for. DonThomas came often to see 'Dr. B.' but the latternever called on the former, though he was glad toreceive Don Thomas and talk with him when hecame, and frequently invited him in his house. AsMonrovian was then a favorite resort of the slavetraders. (who indeed finished a great part of the businessof the Liberians.) other gentlemen of that popularclass were introduced to Dr. B., who alwaysendeavored to treat them with the same countryand kindness with which they treated him. Commercial Advertiser who indeed finished a great part of the businessof the Liberians. A few weeks previous to his introduction tothese interesting strangers by the Baptist and MethodistLiberians, he was on about the 19th of Juneintroduced by Dr James Hall (formerly Physicianto the colony, in the employ of the American colonizationSociety, afterwards founder and Governorof the colony at Cape Palmas, and at the presenttime General Agent of the Maryland ColonizationSociety) to Theodore Canot, a factor or associateof Blanco, and then carrying on the slave-trade inLiberia at New Sesters, about as far eastward andsouth ward from Monrovia is as Galinhas is northwardand westward. The interview was a very briefone, occurring merely while Dr. Hall and Mr Canotwere trading in commodities designed lot theslave-trade. This is the totality of his intimacy with slave-traders'while connected with the Colonization Society,—an intimacy which originated solely in thatcennection. 'Subsequently,' he became a resident at CapePalmas, at the Mission of the American Board ofCommissioners for Foreign Missions, which continuedto the his home until be finally left Afriesand went to England. During that period, hemade three voyages along the coast, on two ofwhich, the vess Is in which he, sailed from place toplace, stopped to made with slave traders at the twoprincipal slave marts in Liberia; (New Sestersand Galinhas;) and at these two places he was permittedto land, and gratify his curiosity by witnessingthe slave-trade in actual operation. Theresults of his observations he has already, in part,published, and hopes to complete the publicationsoon. This was the amount of his 'intimacy withslave-traders, subsequently,' except that on hisvoyage to the Gambia and Senegal, and there visitedRissao and Bulama, where the slave-trade wasthen curried on by Don Caetano Jose de Nicolina,a Portuguese gentleman, previously and since Governorof the Portuguese colomes in that region. Referring to a communication of J B Pinneysin the Commercial Advertiser, Dr Bacon says. Commercial Advertiser It should be noticed first, that 'J.B. Pinney'(agent of the Colonization Society) admits that JohnN. Lewis, now Secretary of the Colony of Liberia,(first by appointment from the American ColonizationSociety, and after wards by appointment proceedingfrom the people.) was engaged in the slavetrade in Liberia, in 1837, was in the employ of thegreat Spanish slave-trader, Don Pedro Blanco, washis store-keeper at Monrovia,—that his warehousein Monrovia was used as Blanco's depot for articlesnecessary to the slave-trade, that Blanco's factorand agents in the slave-trade boarded at Lewis'sdwelling house in Monrovia, and that many slavevessels came to Monrovia in that year to supplythemselves from Blanco's depot for the slave trade.The only corrections which J.B. Pinney attemptsto make in the Day-Book's statement are—thatLewis was not at that time a communicant in theBaptist Church,—and that he did not make aspeech at the little Colonization meeting in theTabernacle two or three weeks since. admits was engaged in the slavetrade in Liberia was communicant As to the latter point, the Day-Book did not saythat he did, the reports in the papers at thetime left that impression on the mind. It is of noconsequence whether he did or not. It is enoughthat he is here as one of 'the delegation from laberia,'as Mayor Havemeyer calls them, and that heis put forward as one of the chief representatives ofthe Colonization cause. As to his church membership, it is enough tosay that he was a member of the Baptist congregation,an attendant on the 'stated prancing ofthe Gospel,' a contributor to its support from moneygained in the slave-trade, and a son-in-law ofthe first pastor of the church. His general characterand deportment were equal if not superiormorality and propriety to those of most actualcommunicants in the Liberian churches, and it wasnot unreasonable to inter that he avaded himself ofall the ordinances of his church. But the public will be impressed with the factthat a promment member of the Baptist determinationin Liberia was openly engaged in the slave-trade,was in the employ of Pedro Blanco in 1837,and that this business was freely tolerated in Liberia,without censure or question from anybody, atthe very time when Colonization agents in the countrytry were demanding money from the deceived benevolentpublic, on the ground that the Colony of Laberiawas the most efficient means for THE SUPRESSION OFTHE AFRICAN SRAVE-TRADE!! All this is ted;and if it were denied, it could be easilyproved. the very time when Colonization agents in the countrytry were demanding money from the deceived benevolentpublic, on the ground that the Colony of Laberiawas the most efficient means for FRICAN RAVE RADE  Another of 'the delegation,' Payne, states thathe was not engaged in the slave-trade at any time,and was not at New Sesters in 1839. This isprobably tine, and he may be exonerated from thisparticular charge. But in correcting the Day-Book'serror, why did he not go on and show thatit was his brother that was in the employ of theslave-traders at New Sesters? This Mr. Payne'sbrother, a little younger than he, and very stronglyresembling him in appearance, did, with the knowledgeand edge and approval of his relatives, engage as anauxiliary to the slave-trade, and was New Sestersat the time Specified. His mother's house wasa regular stopping place for the Spanish and Portugueseslave traders when they visited Monrovian,who were, in fact, the principal support of thefamily. If this Mr. Payne inherited or even receivedany money from his mother, he must havepartaken of the profits of the slave-trade. Theeditor of the Day-Book not being sufficiently familiarwith the initials of the two Paynes, had supposedfor some years that the brother whom heknew at New Sesters was the person subsequentlyordained as pastor. They were both very goodyoung men, nephews of the pastor of the Baptistchurch; and most of the family were quite religious,according to the Liberian standard. his brother But now, will Mr. Payne, or any of the agents ofthe Colonization Society who know anythingabout the facts, venture to say that church membersin Liberia did not, at that time, freely aid and promotethe slave-trade whenever they could find employmentfrom the slave-traders? Will they pretendthat it was considered immoral or improper todo so, or that there could bare been any churchcensure applied to a communicant who subsistedentirely upon money made be him in the slave-trade?There never was a word of censure utteredby any Liberian against those thus employed.The pastor of the Baptist church at that theRev. Colis Teage, (uncle of Mr Payne,) was employed,at the same time with John N. Lewis, tostore cargoes for Pedro Blanco. His store housewas also a depot for the slave-traders, and he receivedplenty of money from Blanco without hesitation.There were dozens and scores of LiberianChristians actively and joyfully engaged of Liberianslave trade, with out any more compunction thanthey would have felt about the palm oil trade. His   It is a notorious fact in Africa, that the colony ofLiberian was for years an important auxiliary to theslave trade, and that the facilities and conveniencesof the slavers were vastly increased by it. TheSpanish and Portuguese slave-traders were alwaysheartily welcomed, and were the most popular menthat ever visited Liberia. Their company wasconsidered a great honor and favor; and all wareeager for their notice. It should be known, too, by the people of thiscountry that the Liberian colonists themselvesFREELY BOUGHT AND OWNED SLAVES at that time,and undoubtedly sold them to their Spanish andPortuguese visitors when they could get a goodprice in doubloons for them, especially in the starvingtimes so often occurring there. Of the latterpoint however, the writer has no positive proof.Of the fact that the colonists (professed Christians)bought and held slaves without scruple, there canbe no denial by any man of truth who has lived inLiberia and become familiar with the customs,morals and habits of the people there. The editorof the Day-Book was advised and strongly urgedby a prominent and most respectable and religiousLiberian, high in office, to purchase two slaves forhis household, on account of the difficulty of retainingfree natives for any considerable time in onesteady employment. bought and held slaves Governor Roberts having denied Dr. Bacon'sstatements concerning himself, as follows, 'Bacon accuses me of being employed in 1837 asthe agent, employee and factor of Pedro Blanco,the greatest slave-trader on the coast, and that Iwas employed by him, Blanco, to purchase vesselsin Sierra Leone, to be used as slavers. Now sir, to be short, I emphatically declare thatI never saw or corresponded with Pedro Blanco inmy life I have never been employed at any timeby him or any other slaver, either directly or indirectly,as an agent employee or factor, or in anyother way during my residence in Africa,— Dr. B. thus replies:— He says he never corresponded with Pedro Blancohis life Undoubtedly true he never saw him.It by corresponding he means that he never wrotea letter to him, or received one from him, that maybe true also. But there are other ways of correspondingthan by writing. It is very evident thata letter from Pedro Blanco (who knew only theSpanish language) could not have been read byJoe Roberts, who knew no language but the English;and a letter from the latter would be equallyunintelligable to the former. Their transactions,therefore must have been carried on through somemedium, which' the Governor' does not supposeTo be included under the term 'correspondence.'There were some very peculiar and terriblereasons why he never saw or correspondedwith Pedro Blanco, who never visited any placeon the whole coast except Galihas, where wasthe centre of his business. and where his powerwas irresistible. Joe Roberts could not risk himselfat any such place or put himself within thepower of Spaniards on that coast, on account of acertain affair on which he had been engaged severalat years previous to the time referred to, as' will behereafter explained. Still, these two worthies becausenecessary to each other's advantage, andfound means to communicate and traffic withoutseeing each other, or writing letters. saw  'Now to be short,'—in the year 1837, Joseph J.Roberts alias 'Governor' Roberts alias, 'President'Roberts, went from Monrovia (Liberia) to SierraLewis, and there, without money or credit of hisown, bought a large schooner which had beencaptured from the slave traders by the British cruisersand condemned by the mixed CommissionCourt as a slaver, pursuant to which condemnationthe vessel was sold at auction, according tothe provisions of the British treaties for the suppressionof the. Slave Trade. This same Robertswent to Sierra Leone in company with John N.Lewis, (now Secretary of the Colony, and now inthis city as one of 'the delegation from Liberian,')who, it is confessed, was an agent employee andstore-keeper of Pedro Blanco. The purchasedslave schooner was christened by the nominal purchaserby the hopeful appellation of the 'MONROVIA,'out of compliment to the chief village of,that Colony, which was founded and supported bythe amiable Colonizationists of the United Statesfor the purpose (among others) of suppressing theSlave Trade. The Monrovia lay at anchor in theroad-stead of Monrovia for a few weeks, entirelyunemployed, and utterly useless to the seeiningowner, who had neither business sufficient to employa vessel of that size, nor the capital nor thecredit to make business of such an amount. Henever possessed in his life money enough to buythe half of such a vessel nor merchandise enoughto fill the half. alias ONROVIA But the Monrovia did not lie idle very long—'About the beginning of July, the brig Ivanhoe,brought from Galinhas to Monrovia, T. RodriguezBuron, heretofore: described as the principal factorand agent of Pedro Blanco- Establishing himself' inthe house and in the store-house of John N. Lewis,he soon took possession the schooner 'Monrovia,'also, with very little ceremony, and sent her off toGalinhas, where she was almost immediately sentto Havana, crowded with miserable slaves destinedto be worked and whipped to death on the sugarplantations of Cuba. Of course, to spare the feelingsof the Colonizationists and other 'friends ofthe slave' and enemies of Slavery the SlaveTrade, the beautiful but inappropriate name ofthe Monrovia' was taken from the schooner when,she was taken from the keeping of her nominalowner into the service of her real owner. Of'course, 'the Governor' or 'the President' of Liberiawill say that he sold the Monrovia to T.RBoron. Undoubtedly, that was the form of thetransaction. Senor Boron himself told the writerof this article that he had 'bought her.' But theyoung Senor was no more able to buy such a vesselfor himself than 'the Governor' was. Hewas merely Blanco's factor, agent, and representative;so that there was no danger that the writerwould misunderstand him Senor Buron did notgenerally make the writer his particular confidentin regard to his transactions at Monrovia with JosephJ. Robert is and John N. Lewis, though his'business with the latter was no secret. It happenedthat the captain of the brig Ivanhoe (of which'T.R. Buron was acting supercargo at that time)was violently attacked with the African fever onboard of his vessel then at anchor in the 'port ofMonrovia' and the writer, of course, was called,in' him professionally, which he did, takingalong Senor Buron with him in his boat. Afterattending to the sick man and leaving the brig toReturn to the village, the writer was requested bySenor Buron to order the boat's crew to pull alongsideof the schooner 'Monrovia,' which lay not,far off, as he wished to give some directions to theCaptain in a mulatto Liberian named cooper) and toimprove him for the negligent manner in whichthe rigging of the vessel was left. The writerreadily complied, without exactly understandingThe relations. of his Spanish companion to tin Liberianvessel, had the latter probably noticing the surpriseinvoluntary manifested, at once said in explanation—She is mine.' Indeed!' 'Yes—Ihave bought her.' As soon as the boat camewithin distance, the Senor gave his ordersin the captain, accompanied with some sharp rebukecarelessness, all which was humblytaken by the Liberian, and the orders were submissivelyobeyed This was the first occasion onwhich writer knew that the transfer of thevessel from Roberts to Blanco had actually takenplace though it was after words familiarly knownin the colony and talked of without a word of censureFrom anybody. he It will be seen what eminent services were inthis way gendered to the slave traders by suchmen as 'Governor' Roberts, and what peculiarfacilities for carrying on the slave trade were furnishedby the Colony of Liberia. When the capturedslave vessels were sold in Sierra Leone,slaves at bargain, the Spaniards themselvescould not go there to bid for them. Neither couldBlanco's English agent at Sierra Leone do it withoutdetection in an offence punishable by the BritishLaws. But the could furnish the money to payfor them when 'Governor' Roberts became thenominal purchaser. The vessels could then leaveSierra Leone under American or 'Laberian' colors,and could be transferred to the real purchaser ina place (then) under the jurisdiction of the AmericanColonization Society without rendering anybody liable to punishment or even to exposureunder ordinary circumstances. This one instance is enough to show the relationof 'Governor' Roberts to the Slave Trade.When he has made his answer to this distinct,specific, and detailed charge, it will be time tolook furthering into his commercial history, to exposemore completely the dishonesty of the pretensionsof the Colonizationists in declaring that the Colonyoperates for the suppression or discouragementof the slave Trade. Dr, Bacon concludes his series of articles> by challengingdisproof of any one of his statements, in anymaterial point; and offers, for that purpose, the trueuse of the columns of his paper N.Y. Day Book. The Congregationalists have often been embarassedby the criticisms and objections of the colored peopleand their friends; bet if Dr Bacon is to be believedfor a moment, they have never had an enemy sopowerful as he. The Colonization society is utterlydishonored, and put to a shameful defeat—shown tobe in league with. slave-traders and supporting slave-holding.

I have not kissed the rock—hewn grot,Where in His Mother's arms He lay,Nor knelt upon the sacred spotWhere last his footsteps pressed the clay;Nor looked on that sad mountain head,Nor smuts any sinful breast where wideHis arms to fold the world he spread.And bowed his bend to bless, and—died!

Read: The Runaway Negroes.—We copy from the LexingtonAugust 11th, the following particulars-concerningthe escape and capture of the negroeswho recently escaped from that neighborhood: The Runaway Negroes. We saw and conversed with Dr. B.F. Barkley ofHarrison, yesterday morning who had just arrivedbearing under his charge Doyle, alias Kelley, aliasSmith, alias Rankin, who was apprehended underthe charge o'aiding the negroes to escape from theneighborhood Dr. Berkley says that the first intimation.the people of Harrison had of the stampede,two negro men belonging to M.T. Scott and B.Gratz, of this city, came into Claysville, HarrisonCountry on Monday morning in a state of starvation,and begged to be brought back.  They reported between forty and seventy negroesto be in the neighborhood, conceated in the woodsMany persons being present in the village, for thepurpose of attending to the election, steps were immediatelytaken to arrest them. Dr. Barklay arrested,when alone a boy belonging to H.T. Duncan, andone to Lawson &Erdman, of this county, both beingarmed with revolving pistols. On Monday evening, about 7 o'clock, the companyraised in Claysville overlook the negroes on theGermantown road and had an engagement withthem, in winch Charles W. Fowler, a very respectableyoung man of Harrison, was mortallywounded. The whites, being only ten strong, were compelledto retreat. In a few minutes. the whites were reinforcedby ten others, when another engagement ensued,in which Joseph Duncan was wounded in themouth. Duncan's horse was also shot under himand fell, throwing him in the midst of the negroes;but by the use of his revolver, he succeeded in fightinghis way through them. The whites were nowcompelled to retreat a second time. The negroes inthe meanwhile became scattered through the woodsand bushes. At 10 o'clock, Monday night, the whites werereinforced by three or four hundred recruits. Therest of the night and Tuesday was spent in scouringthe woods up and down Licking river and its tributaries.A party also pushed on to the Ohio, to haveFoster's Landing Dover, and other places along theriver, guarded On Tuesday, The white man wasarrested. The whites were with great difficulty restrainedfrom hanging the prisoner on the spot. Butat the earnest solicitation of Gen. Desha he wasspared. He was then carried to Claysville beforethree magistrates, tried and committed. Dr. Barkley says the most intense excitement prevailedthrough the country, several thousand mensecuring the country between Licking and the Ohiorivers. Dr. Barkley and some others, secretly removedDoyle from the jail of Cynthiana, at 12 o'clock, onWednesday night, and arrived in this city early yesterdaymorning. and lodged him in jail. Doyle wasbrought here for fear the excited populace wouldpull down the jail and hang him. Up to Wednesdaynight, thirty-three negroes had been arrested, andone killed.

Anangel assured Daniel (ix. 25, 26) that, from the givingforth of the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem,to the cutting off of the Messiah, should be sixty—nineweeks—that is, 483 days; and, if we find that thisnumber of years passed between the going forth ofthis commandment and the crucifixes of Christ, weshall infer that, at least for that time, the propheticday was a year. How, then, is the fact? It is statedin his history, that Ezra was commissioned by Artaerxos,457 years before the birth of Christ—that is,about 490 years before his crucifixion. But Ezra wasnot authorized to rebuild Jerusalem; but the templeonly,(Ex. Vii. 11—26,) already rebuilt, was to befurnished by him, and the service of God, accordingto the law, put in operation. This commandmentcame forth on the first of the seventh year of Artaxerxes.(verses8, 9)  day   But it was Nehemiah, who, (Ne. ii. 1,5,6.) thirteenyears afterwards, brought forth the commandmentto rebuild the city. Hence, it will be seen,this commandment went forth, 477 years before thecrucifixion of Christ. The given number of days483, exceeds this number of years; whence we mayinfer, that the prophetic day is not equal to a year.What, then, is the duration of this day? If we suppose the historian's year to consist of365 solar days, these 477 years reduced to 174,105days, and this, divided by 483, gives, for the propheticday, but a fraction over 360 solar days. It alsoappears that, in very early time, 360 days were considereda year; whence it seems that the propheticday, before the coming of Messiah, was the measureof time, once called a year. Another question, however, presents itself—Though in the predictions of ancient events, theprophetic day be what was then called a year, mightit not be that, in the predictions of later events, thisday is what is now called a year? This is the question on which we have hesitatedIn our exposition on the comings of Christ, we statedaccording to our understanding of prophecy, thatgreat commotions would take place in Europe, andthat the power of the Pope would terminate as earlyas the year 1866. We say, as early, for, the papalpower having risen in the year 606, its 42 monthsor 1260 days, must terminate at 1866, even if theprophetic day, in these predictions, be a full yearIf, however, this year be only 360 solar days, thetime of these revolutions must arrive prior to thatdate. And let us inquire, on this supposition, whenthese things are to be. The 1260 prophetic days reduceto 453,600 solar days, and, since a year, inmodern estimation, is 365 1-4 days, we obtain, verynearly, 1242 years, for the duration of papal powerThis, added to the date of its rise, gives 1848, for thedate of its termination. We may ask, do not the transactions, going on inEurope, indicate that the fulfilment of these predictionshas indeed commenced? Has Popery now thepower, which it formerly had, to 'wear out the saintsof the Most high, 'or' to change times and laws,' asit was wont to do, during the three and a half timesDaniel vii. 25. An earthquake has evidently commenced, which,in its course, may prove 'such as was not, since menwere upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, andso great,' (Rev. xvi. 18)—a shaking of 'the heavensand the earth'—in the which God will 'overthrowthe throne of kingdoms, and destroy the strength ofthe kingdoms of the heathen.' (Hag. ii. 21, 22. The thrones have commenced their fall; (Dan.vii. 9,) and 'the Ancient of Days,' or (verse 26) 'theJudgment,' which takes away the oppression ofpriests and monarchs, has commenced his sitting.And (verse 11) though prophesy will yet speak some'great wreat words,' still, if we rightly understand,it will come to its certain termination, (xii. 11) withinthirty years. Indeed, as some have inferred frompolitical indications, the present Pope may possiblybe the last. In these events,(Rev. xvi. 15,) Christ has 'comeas a thief'; and the 'brightness of his coming' willdestroy 'the man of sin.' (II. Thes. ii 8) Let usdiscern the sign of the time, and rejoice exceedingly. O. NORCROSS. Belchertown, July, 1848.

 WALTHAM, Aug.16, 1848. ALTHAM MR QUINCY: R DEAR SIR—It appears that within the short timeof one year, many of the clergy of the Universalistorder have changed their views on the subject ofthe Sabbath. They were once opposed to the Orthodoxon this question, and accused them of beingbigoted; hence the name of Infidel was applied toUniversalists, by all the evangelical portion ofChristiandom, (so called.) Now many of those menwho were loudest for untrammelling the Sabbath ofthe old Jewish rituals, are the first to oppose andmisrepresent the anti—Sabbath movements. EAR IR No man was more liberal, in preaching and publishinghis views in favor of the sentiments advancedby brother H. Ballou, 2d, on the Sabbath, than theeditor of the Trumpet, before the call of a Conventionlast March. He used to contend that it was'lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.' Now hemisrepresents those who are contending for thetruth, on this subject. He made known his feelingson the 24th of last March, when he applauded AbigailFolsom as she, in her maniacal ravings, disturbedthe meetings at the Melodeon. His determinedstamp confirmed his hate of the movements of thatConvention. I noticed his conduct at that Convention.through the columns of the Liberator, somemonths ago. stamp confirmed his hate The Rev. S. Cobb is another who has given a falsecoloring to the object of the Anti-Sabbath Call.While that gentleman was a settled minister in thisplace a few years ago, he was most liberal on thisall—important subject, never restraining his childrenfrom their sports and innocent amusements on Sundaybut allowing them the greatest latitude for theirrecreation. See now the change as it regards hisfalse representations through his paper, the 'Freeman,'(falsely so called.) I know there are many ofThe preachers of the Universalist order who are righton this subject, and who are disgusted with Whitte-moreand Cobb, for their misrepresentations of themen and doings of the Anti-Sabbath movement.The Rev. Hosea Ballou, 2d, of Medford, is right, ashas been shown through your paper; and we shallfind, on a 'second, sober thought, 'many more, whowill not prove recreant to their first principles, whichwas decidedly the ground taken by the anti-Sabbathmen and women. But the friends of liberty have awakened thecommunity to their rights on this important matter,so much so, that the priests cannot arrest them withtheir hypocritical babblings. What are the facts inthe case? Since last March, a regular train of carsrunning from Fitchburg to Boston every Sundaymorning, and returning at evening, often full ofpassengers, is one of the results. And that is notall; the enterprising proprietors of the Walthamand Boston line of stages, Messrs. Alden &Mansurproprietors, runs two trips per Sunday, whichis a very great accommodation to this place. I hopenext summer we shall know, that all the railroadsWill adopt this practice by running a train of carsfrom city to country, and returning in the evening;so that the people may have an opportunity to from that the close, unhealthy atmosphere of thecity, to the balmy fields and weeds of the country.I have no doubt it will soon be the case.

 Papers from Portland, Me., inform us that onthe afternoon of Saturday, July 22d, the wife andthree children of Mr. Wm. I Smith, and four childrenof Mr. John Whyley—eight persons in all—were all drowned in Portland harbor by the upsettingof a boat in which they were taking apleasure excursion. Mr. Smith saved himself byclinging to the mast; and Mr. Stephenson whohad charge of the boat, saved himself by swimmingto an adjoining ledge. Mr. Whyley, who waswatching for the return of his little ones when thefearful news reached him, has been in a state ofdelirium almost all the time since. Saturday If this accident had occurred on a Sunday, itwould, no doubt, have been trumpeted throughoutthe country as a solemn warning against takingpleasure excursions on that day, and a striking instanceof God's interposion to punish the desecrationof it. But it occurred on the Sabbath, insteadof a Sunday, and hence no particular notice is takenof it, and no newspaper serinons are deliveredon the occasion. For our part, we are not accustomedto regard God as employing himself on theSabbath, much more than on other days, in capsizingsail boats and smashing railroad cars; and weare not disposed, therefore, to write a sabbatic homilyin view of this fact. We beg leave to suggest,however, to those who are in the habit of gatheringup what they call 'Sabbath Accidents,' thatthis one may deserve their attention quite as wellas a majority of those to which ther attention isgiven, and we think it would be especially appropriatefor them to explain it so as not to impairthe argument which they often frame in favor ofSunday. WAS IT SABBATH—BREAKING?—The PittsburgChronicle of July 3d says that on Sunday afternoon,about 5 o'clock, Messrs. Carey and Ryan were instantlykilled by lightning, as they were returningto their residence in Birmingham. They had beenteaching at the Sunday School attached to St.Paul's Church. One of the junior brothers, whowas between them, escaped unhurt. AS IT ABBATH REAKING The Sunday coercionists, emboldened by therecent decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvanian,had some of the knights of the razor andscissors, in the City of Brotherly Love, arraignedlast week, for profaning the sacredness of the 'civilrest-day' in exercising their vocation, not havingthe fear of man before them, nor having any regardfor humanly—appointed 'holy time.' The Magistrate,however, set the diabolical perpetrators atliberty, and thus declared to the world, that manythings which have been done may be done again;in which we see indications of public sentiment,that the screws have been screwed too tight, andare beginning to spring. So mote it be, until thosewho act from pure conscientious feelings in thematter have extended to them the same consideration.—Sabb. Rec. profaning 'civilrest-day' holy time. Sabb. Rec. THE CASE OF THE BARBERS.—Yesterday, twopersons belonging to the trade of barbers wereheard before Alderman Mitchell, on a complaint fordesecrating the Sabbath in exercising their vocationon that day. After hearing the testimony, themagistrate decided that the work performed wasone of necessity, and was not punishable under theact of the Assembly; that cleanliness was au importantduty enjoined by society, and if a mancould not perform the operation of shaving himself,the individual employed to do it for him wasno more liable than he would be, if he were chargedwith an infraction of the law. The parties wereaccordingly discharged.—Phil. Ledg. HE ASE OF THE ARBERS. Phil. Ledg. Sunday travelling has receniy been abolished onthe railroad between Albany and Schenectady. Acorrespondent of the New York Express says ithas been done through the influence of E.C. Delavan,and that the wicked think it is to keep travellersover Sunday in the Delavan House at Albany. Be thatas it may, the writer says that 'to be more wicked,the travellers catch up with hackney coaches, omnibuseswagons, and all sorts of vehicles, to takethem up to Schenectady on a Sunday, when theUtica railroad takes them one way, and the Saratogarailroad another. Thus, some hundred horsesor more, with half as many drivers, are kept prancingand capering through the streets of Albany andSchenectady, when, if the railroad was worked.there would be sinning only by the locomotive, theengineer, and two or three others. This questionof Sunday travel has many sides to it. If all therailroads would stop, the case would be a littledifferent. But then it would be necessary to stopthe horses and the vehicles; for at present, twentypeople are moving others between Albany andSchenectady, where one would be to work if therailroad was in motion.

 The old Missouri Compromise was concocted onthe Sabbath day. Henry Clay tells us that thecommittee met, and arranged the whole thing onthat day. It will be seen by the congressional reports, thatthe Compromise now pending in the Senate wasplanned, arranged, and adopted by the Committeeon Sunday, July 16th. Perhaps they think it impartsa peculiar sacredness to these compromisesto make them on the Sabbath. Would it not bewell, for the American Tract Society to revise theirbook on Sabbath desecration, and tell the peoplewhether Southern slaveholders are 'lords also ofthe Sabbath? As Gen. Taylor fought some of hisbattles on the Sabbath, those Christians that aresupporting him would probably like to know whetherbutchering Mexicans is also a 'work of necessityor mercy.' A revised edition of the work, adoptedto the times, would probably do as much goodas the premium tract on dancing. W.D. Christians adoptedto the times 

 From Hayti.—The Jamaica Dispatch of the 4thinst. says, that when the schooner Pacific, whicharrived at Jacmel on Tuesday, the lot. left Porte anPrince, repeated executions or persons of color weretaking place there. The President's return was momentlyexpected, when it was believed that a renewal,of the wholesale slaughter which recently tookplace there would be again recommenced. A Frenchvessel of war was at Porte as Prince—and therewere none belonging to other nations in any otherpart of Hayti. David Truie, ex-Minister of the Intenor,and citizen Eliee, of the Civil Department,were killed. It seems that President Souloque, whowas at Jeremic, had only to send to his first general,Sim Ibem, orders to sacrifice an individual, and it wasimmediately effected.

 IRASCIBILITY OF TEMPER. The greatest plaguein life is a bad temper. It is a great waste of timeto complain of other people's; the best thing is toamend our own; and the next best quality is tolearn to bear with what we meet in others. A badtemper will always tire itself out, if it find no oneto resent it; and this very knowledge is worth atrifle. Irascibility is very injurious to health, andso, in fact, is every morbid indulgence of our inferiornature—low spirits, melancholy, diffidence,disinclination for ordinary duties, discontent, fretfulness,even down to mental lascitude, indolence,or despair—are very inimical to enjoyment in life,and every possible effort should be made to castthem all to the winds, and look unblushingly intothe truth of the fact.

One volume See., sheep, 1032 pages; price THE PUBLISHERS respectfully invite attentionto the following eminent testimony to the excellenceof this standard Dictionary. The execution of this Dictionary fully answers toits title. The VOCABULARY is probably more compresensivethan that of all the preceding English Dictionariesunited. OCABULARY Constant reference is made to AUTHORITIES withrespect to words newly introduced, and care is takento note such as are technical, foreign, obsolete, provincial,or vulgar. UTHORITIES The DEFINITIONS are clear and exact, and thosepertaining to technical and scientific terms are speciallyvaluable to the general reader. The author has evidently bestowed great labor onPRONUNCIATION. His system of notation, which iseasily understood, and founded on a more completeanalysis of the vowel sounds than we have elsewheremet with, together with his plan of exhibitingall the beat English authorities in relation towords differently pronounced by different othoepists,gives to this work important advantages as a PronouncingDictionary. In ORTHOGRAPHY he has made no arbitrary changes,but where usage is various and fluctuating, hehas aimed to be consistent, and to reduce to thesame rules words of a similar formation. RTHOGRAPHY The insertion of GRAMMATICAL FORMS AND INFLICTIONOF WORDS to a much greater extent than theyare given in other English Dictionaries, and theshort critical notes on the orthography, the pronunciation,the grammatical form and construction, andthe peculiar, technical, local and American uses ofwords interspersed through the volume, give to thiswork much additional value. The copious VOCABULARY OF MODERN GEOGRAPHICALNAMES with their pronunciation, and a greatlyenlarged and improved edition of Walker's Key tothe pronunciation of Classical and Scripture ProperNames, are important appendages to the Dictionary. OCABULARY OF ODERN EOGRAPHICALNAMES A year has passed since this Dictionary was published;and its already extensive use, both amongcultivated English readers and men of wide learningaffords good testimony of its merits. We confidentlyrecommend it as containing an ample andcarelel view of the present state of our language. JARED SPARKS, LL. D, McLean Professor ofAncient and Modern History, Harvard University.
