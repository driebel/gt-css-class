 The question of closing the corresponding relationbetween the Congregational and Presbyterianchurches, on account of the admission of slaveholdersto the common of the latte, is evidentlyregarded with deep interest by New EnglandChristians. There is, however a diversity ofviews in relation to the expediency of the measure;so be regarding it as very desirable, othersbeing decidedly opposed to it, and still others whoare in doubt which course would most effectuallybear upon the removal of the evil. All classes areamong at the same results, but there is a diversityof opinions in regard to the most appropriatemeans; and as is too often the cast, there is wantingmuch of that charity which should exist betweenthe proposed disciples of Christ, who mayconscientiously entertain different views in regardto the expediency of the measures to be adoptedfor gaining a desirable object. Those in favor ofdissolving these relations between the churches,have too frequently conveyed the idea that theywho entertained different views, were apologistsfor slavery, and were exerting an influence to upholdthe system, and to soothe the consequences ofthe slaveholders. Their opponents have beenequally severe and uncharitable to their charges.A correspondent of the New York Observer, overthe signature of 'A New England Pastor,' characterizesthose who whose would close the correspondenceon account of slavery, as 'ultra men, resolute andfierce', and those entertaining different views, as'reasonable and just-minded men.' He chargesthe former class with using 'reproachful namesand inuendos,' instead of 'truth and argument;'and then speaks of them as 'that peculiar—whatshall I call it?—whose strong is in its tail,' andcharges them with insincerely, and wanting onlyAGITATION AGITATION, and ranks them all as abolitionistsof the Garrison school. Such languageand such arguments on either side will never convince.They will rather serve to fix the party toWhom they are applied, in a state of more inflexibleopposition. GITATION GITATION Any one well acquainted with the state of publicopinion, knows that ultra abolitionists is losingits foothold in New England, and becoming confusedto a small faction; white he real anti-slaveryfeeling is deepening and extending through all themisses o four population; and it there is any onesentiment of a public character which is fasteningupon the mind and moving he feeling of our peoplemore than any other, it is that of opposition toslavery. We see it developed in political movements.No party can succeed, no candidate foroffice can secure public confidence, of opposition toslavery is wanting. Thus movement of the commonsense of New England is irresistible, andwould sweep away the popularity of our strongeststatesmen, should they attempt to resist it. Andit is not strange that the same men, acting in thecapacity of a church, should suffer the same feelingsto predominate in their church relations,but this spirit of anti-slavery which is so deeplymoving the misses of New England, is not excitedto carry its measures contrary to the laws orthe constitution. All legal and equitable rights ofthe slaveholder must be respected; but he mostexpect no more concessions. We cannot abrogateslavery where it exists, but it must not be extended.So likewise we cannot infringe in he leaston the religious rights and privileges of slaveholders,and we have no right to judge that they cannotbe Christians if they hold slaves. I believethere are multitudes of good Christians who areslaveholders; and so I believe there were multitudesof good Christians who were reellers;but I do not believe that with the present degreeof light on the subject, Christians can be engagedin that traffic, with a clear conscience, or withoutlosing their evidence that they are Christians.Nor do I believe that slaveholders, with the samedegree of right, can engage in many of the practiceswhere are almost necessarily incident to slaveryand maintain clear consciences and evidenceof being Christians. The time was when Rev.John Newton could he concerned in the slavetrade in all its horrors, and yet maintain a respectablestanding in the church of Christ, and foraught we know, a conscience void of offence; butwho supposes that such a course of contact wouldbe tolerated for a moment now by any body ofevangelical Christians? So slaveholders mightonce have bought and sold their fellow men forgain, might have requested their labor and servicewithout compensation, aught have kept them inthis state of unrequited servitude, without usingany efforts to enlighten and Christianize them,and might sell parts of families, thus causing aseparation for life; but I do not believe that sucha slaveholder would have any very clear evidenceof possessing a Christian character, or a very easyconscience, if he contained such practices after acandid and prayerful enquiry in regard to the correctednessof his conduct. were  Now the question is, will the slaveholder besooner brought to see and to feel the sinfulness ofsuch conduct by containing the correspondence,and kindly urging it upon his attention; or byclosing the correspondence, and thus protestingagainst the sin? Which will most effectuallyawaken his conscience, and bring him to repentance? The writer referred to urges the continuance ofcorresponding relations on the ground that slaverywas tolerated by the apostles. On the samegrounds he would justify has own church membersin holding slaves, and engaging in the objectionablepractices of slaveholders. I believe that very fewN.E. pastors or churches would come on to thatPlatform. But while the apostles did not attempt to abolishslavery directly, they so expounded and applied thegospel, that their teachings were followed, all itsobjectionable fractures would be removed, and therelation of master and servant would be merelynominal. Masters are charged to forbear threatening,'knowing that your Master also is in Heaven;neither is there respect of persons with him.'And again, masters are expressly commanded to'give unto their servants that which is just and equal,knowing that they have also a Master in Heaven,'Col. iv. 1. See also James v. 4; 1 The. iv. 6.Christ also teaches, 'All things what so everywould that men should do to you, do ye even so tothem, for this is the law and the prophets.' Nowif these and such like precepts are obeyed, thespirit of slavery will cause, whether the name iscontinued or not; and it is not right, therefore,to bolster up the slaveholder with any such reliance. give unto their servants that which is just and equal I do not think that New England people ingeneral entertain the opinion that slavery is sin,per se; nor that they believe Christian slaveholdersguilty of maltreating their slaves. In their physicalcondition, the slaves are undoubtedly better off thanthe serfs of Europe,—altogether better feel andclothed than the poor of Ireland, and their sufferingsfrom chastisements than is endured bymultitudes in our own land from the effects of intemperance.In certain cases, too, the relation ofmaster and slave may be sustained as a positiveduty, and perfectly consistent with the spirit of thegospel precepts. So too, the traffic in ardent spiritsfor medicinal purposes is perfectly justifiable;but it is quit another thing, when a man engagesin the traffic in the article as a beverage, for thesake of gain, 'when he gives his neighbor drink,and puts his bottle to him and makes, him drunkenalso J.P.F. per se 

 ☞The Taylor Electoral Ticket was chosen bybe Legislature of Massachusetts on Friday last, bya majority of nearly one hundred. 

 Although the election has passed, we are notwilling that the people should lose sight of themenus which were used to nominate General Taylor,or of the men who urged his nomination uponthe country. The following letter from CharlesHudson, of Massachusetts, to Hon. Judge Allen,of Massachusetts, is worthy of especial attention.Mr. Huds n, by his support of Taylor, has givenevidence that he prefers being in the majoritywithout principle, to being in the minority withprinciple. He has his choice. He made it. Hemust abide the result. We copy the letter fromthe Boston Chronotype: Just on the eve of the Philadelphia Convention,Mr. Hudson wrote the following letter to JudgeAllen, which the latter how for the first time publishes,omitting only two paragraphs describingthe mode of proceeding at the Harrisburg Conventionin 1840. The letter is surpassingly rich: WASHINGTON, May 28, 1848. ASHINGTON MY DEAR SIR:—The time is approaching whenyour will be at the big Convention to select a candidatefor the Presidency; and I presume thatyou feel just as I felt in 1839, that you wish to begoverned by your own sense of propriety, and notby the politicians at Washington. It would be agreat blessing to the country, if the members herewould leave the whole matter to the Delegates.But there are certain men who have made thebusiness of selecting a candidate the great businessof the session. The Taylor men have beeninstant in season and out of season to press hisclaims, and in fact demand for, him support.Among these may be mentioned  TrumanSmith, of Connection,' who, considering his positionas a Northern man, has done more for Taylorismthan any other man. He will be at theConvention. The prime movers in behalf of Mr.Clay were one half of them sincere, and the otherhalf urged has name as the most effectual way ofkilling off Taylor. Gen. Scott seems now to belooking up; but, after all, the sober, substantialWhigs, here are inclined to Judge Mc Lean.Were it not for a personal feeling between thefriends of Corwin and the Judge, I think the latterwould b the favorite of Ohio. Thus much Ithought it proper to say, that you might knowhow things stand here. I know nothing of yourviews on the subject, but presume that you go fora Northern name; and it. Webster is out of thequestion, it will, as it now seems, lie betweenScott and McLean. My own opinion is that thelatter will be the strongest in all parts of thecountry. Y EAR IR demand  With Taylor, I fear we should lose our ownState, and sacrifice our own principles. For one, Ihad rather be in a minority adhering to principle,than in a majority without principle. But I write your principally for the purpose ofsuggesting the mode of bringing about a nomination. Much will be done out of doors, and I wouldsuggest to you the propriety of being at Philadelphiaa day or two before the meeting of the Convention.The Whigs the a powerful foe to contendwith, and it would be well to select such acandidate as would in case of defeat, leave us inpossession of our principles. The slave powermost be resisted sooner or later, and the sooner itis done the better. You will understand that I do not write you toinfluence your vote, or to inter here in the least withyour functions as delegate. But believing that ourviews and feelings harmonize on this subject, Ihave felt at liberty to speak freely. I should bepleased to see you at Washington. Perhaps youmay come on here before or after the Convention.Hoping that wisdom may guide you all—and thata good selection may be made, I subscribe myself, Yours most respectfully.

 FAIRMOUNT, Stark Co. Ohio. AIRMOUNT To ANDREW PATON, Glasgow Scotland; NDREW ATON Glasgow Scotland DEAR ANDREW: EAR NDREW The last letter I addressed to you was written onboard of a steamer, on Sunday, (Oct. 22,)going downthe Ohio river. Since then, I have held meetings onwar, in several places; and in all of which meetingsa storm of sectarian and pro-war indignation has descendedupon me, by reason of my preferring to believethat man is fallible, rather than admit that Godis unjust and changeable. Shall I sacrifice God uponthe alter of man's infallibility? Is God a compoundof absurdities and contradictions—a demon ofwrath, malevolence, revenge and blood; or werethe writers of the Jewish Record, in some instances,mistaken; I prefer to believe those writers were,sometimes, mistaken. There two persons, a man and wife, have justleft my room. They came in to converse with meon the evil effects on children, of the practice ofkilling animals for food. They wish me to take theground, that man has no right to live at the expenseof animal life. I cannot argue that question withany one. I do believe it tends to harden the heartsand blunt the moral perceptions of children, to seethe slaughter of lambs, calves, and other animals forfood. How much more, then, must it harden theirhearts, and render their moral susceptibilities obtuse,to read of the death penalties, and terrificslaughter of men, women, and children, that are recordedin the Jewish Scriptures! And what Conceptionsof God must they have, when told that hecommanded and approved those deeds!! I am in a log house, in Ohio. It is a comfortable,happy house. To give some idea of the hospitalityoften funnel in these cabins of logs, I would say, thatyesterday, Sunday, we held an anti-war meeting inFairmount meeting-house, all day. Some cameten and some twenty miles. In this log house, ninepersons from abroad were entertained, and foundcomfortable food and bedding; and the family werenot taken by surprise, nor were they put out, nordisturbed from their ordinary quite order, by the in-flexof company. For, in their cabin of logs, theyhad beds and bedding, and the choicest food-enoughfor all I have seldom seen hospitality practicedon such a scale as I have seen it among thesesettlers in Ohio, and they make their company feelthat they are welcome, and that the entertainers arethe parties obliged. My experience has been amongthe reformers, the non-resistants and abolitionists,manly. The man and wife, who own this log house,also own and cultivate 160 acres of land around it.They raise Indian corn, wheat, and oats, and vegetablesof all kinds, and fruit, peaches, apples, pears,plums, and quinces, enough for their own use, andto sell. They have 300 sheep; several cows; horsesto labor of travel with; a fine large barn, and goodouthouses of all kinds; a fine fruit orchard about thehouse They have dried, for use during the comingyear, for themselves and for sale,40 bushels ofpeaches-taking five bushels of fresh peaches tomake one of dried-thus taking 200 bushels of freshpeaches to make 40 of dried. They have made someeight or ten bushels of dried apples. These driedpeaches and apples are an important article of food,and you could not probably sit down at their table,during the coming year, without seeing peaches orapples on the table in the shape of pies or stewedsince, as it is here called. Then you would findcarrant, cherry, or grape, or plum preserves, or jam,as you would call it Never did I witness tablesspend with such fresh, delicious, and choice food,as I have seen in these log cabins and farm housesat Ohio; and I never sit at these tables without wishingthat the laborers of Europe could be here to earn,by industry, and enjoy, these luxuries. This manand woman in whose hospitable house I am, till heirown land, except the hiring of a man to aid them intime of harvest. The price of a hired laborer onland here, by the year, is 10 dollars (2) per month,and the employer feeds and lodges the laborer.This family raises 70 bushels of Indian corn, and 20bushels of wheat, on an average, to the acre (Englishacre.) The women, here, never work on theland, except at be among the new comers from Germanyand Ireland; but these soon leave the outdoorwork to the men, and the women do the indoorwork Tending cattle, sheep and horses, in winteror summer, is entirely the business of men. Thewomen in Europe often do this work, as well as workon the land. To see this man and woman with theirgroup of young children, in an anti-war or anti-slaverymeeting, you would never dream that theylived in a log house, so profusely furnished with allthat is comfortable, or that they were laborers onthe land. And then their interest and intelligenceon all the great questions that agitate this nation,and the nations of Europe! And they are but aspecimen of their neighbors around them. I lookcut of my window upon a belt of native forests, thegrowth of centuries, and upon the stumps that surroundme. The forests are now stripped of their gloriousfoliage, and look bare and desolate. I cannot but look back 50 years, my own term of existence—and see this an unbroken wilderness; andnow, the energy and industry of man have felledthe mighty forests, and opened them to human habitations,and made the wilderness to bud and blossomis the rose. jam  English But, dear Andrew, I have strayed from my subjectNo matter. Life is a queer Compound. Sois my letter. All the better. It will be more life-like life The following resolutions were passed yesterday,in a large meeting, without a dissenting voice:— Resolved, That some of the deeds, said to havebeen done by the express command and approval ofGod, are opposed to the Divine nature, to the Christianreligion, and to the unchangeable relations andduties of man to man; and, therefore, those writerswere mistaken when they assert that God commandedand approved those deeds. Reserved, That those who father upon Godthe penal laws and aggressive, exterminating wars ofthe Old Testament virtually deny his justice, benevolence,and immutability. They represent Godis unjust and changeable, rather than admit thatthan may be mistaken; they sacrifice God upon thealtar of man's infallibility. they sacrifice God upon thealtar of man's infallibility. Resolved, That it is wiser, more Christian, morerational, more just, and more humane, to admit thatthe writers of the Old Testament were in some invoicesmistaken, than to believe that God is unjust, malevolent and changeable. You are well aware of the excitement these resolutionswould create, in a community trained to believethat the writers of the Old Testament were infallible,and that God actually did every thing whichthey ascribe to him. Two men, followers of AlexanderCampbell, came forward yesterday, and stoutlymaintained that nothing could be known of thecharacter of God, except through the Bible, and thatevery sentence and word of the O. and N.T. werethe words of God; and that if we rejected one sentence,as being erroneous, we must reject the whole.To escape my conclusions, they would not admitthat those wars and penalties would now be opposedto the nature of God. Day before yesterday,Saturday, in a meeting, eight miles distant, a Presbyterianboiled over with sectarian wrath, and toldme that he was astonished that God did not strikeme dead, and send me to hell, for uttering suchblasphemies as those contained in the above resolutions.He expected to see me fall dead, as I wasspeaking He was very wrathy about it. He declaredthat God did authorize the avenger of bloodto put to death the man, who accidentally killedanother, though 'he knew him to be perfectly innocent;'and that God did command Joshua to put to death innocent children because their fathers stole:and that I denied all destination between justice andinjustice, because I denied it. He now was thoroughlyfurious in defense of the Old Testament. ANew Brighton, a week ago, a Presbyterian come forwardin a meeting, and declared me to be the greatestblasphemer he ever heard; that he had ten timesbeen tempted to leave the meeting; that I had slanderedthe Old Testament saints, and cast contemptupon God. 'Would these wars and deeds he in accordancewith the Divine, nature now?' I asked'Yes,' said he; 'God has a right to require us tokill our prisoners of war—the male children andmarried women, and to give the unmarried onesto the men for their use; God has a right to requireus to invite a man into our house, under the offer offriendship and protection, and then, when we havehim in, and asleep, to require us to stab him; Godhas a right to require a father to sacrifice his children,and to stone them for disobedience; a right tocommand us to wage an exterminating war, and toslaughter every man, woman and child, even thongthey never entertained one unkind thought towardsus' He declared these would be in perfect harmonywith the nature of God. 'Would you receiveAbraham, Jacob, Moses, Gideon, Samson,David and Solomon into your Presbyterian church,if they were living in New Brighton now, and wereto do as we are told they did then?' 'I believe theywere pious, godly men,' said he. 'But would youreceive them into your church?' I asked. 'I wishthe church to which I belong was made up ofas good and holy men,' said he 'It may all betrue that the Presbyterian church is made up of worsemen than those who had many wives and concubines,and perpetrated deeds that would now consign, themto the dungeon or gallows; but that does not answerthe question—Would you take them into yourchurch?' He repeated that he wished the churchnow was made up of as good men—and this was allhe would say. expected Recently, at a discussion in Andover, Ohio, myopponent, rather than admit the possibility that theOld Testament writers were mistaken, in any case,declared that the whole penal code of the Jews wasbinding on us, and that parents were bound now toalone their children to death for disobedience. yesterday,my two opponents took the ground, that wecan have no knowledge of right and wrong, of justiceand injustice, and of the attributes of God, exceptthrough the Bible. They admitted that the existenceof God might be known without the book, butsaid that we could harm nothing of his characterwithout it, and have no idea of right and wrong. THE BIBLE THE ONLY INFALLIBLE RULE OFFAITH AND PRACTICE! It is a monstrous delusion,by whomsoever uttered, and a falsehood. So far frombeing an infallible rule, no rule can be more fallible.In the nature of the case, there can be no infallibilityabout it. What is the Bible? A book, written byvery many men, who lived in different ages of theworld—and extending over a period of thousands ofyears;—and written in fragments, that were preservedby transcribers, and constantly liable to mistakes.Many of the compositions are from unknownauthors, and the canon, or books, settled by a councilof as corrupt and dissolute men as ever met together.That book has an infinite variety of interpretations.Nothing can be fixed and settled as certaintruth about it, as a whole, though its moral preceptsare perfectly plain. This book is called infallible,as a whole—and it is said to be a sin of thedeepest dye to doubt or question the truth of anyone passage in it! HE IBLE THE infallible canon as a whole as a whole One fact is strikingly prominent in the history ofthe Bible. It has ever been made to confirm to popularopinion The Bible imprisoned Gables as an infidel,but when his opinions of astronomy were commonlyreceived, the Bible came round, and declaredit never taught a different doctrine. The Bible (Imean always as received by the Church and Clergy)now sanctions clavery. In a few years, that samebook will declare that it never did and never cansanction it. The Bible now declares war to be justand godlike; in a few years it will deny that it eversanctioned war. The Bible, as received by the advocatesof the gallows and sword, declares that Godhas commanded disobedient children, Sabbath-breakers,idolaters, adulterers and murderers, to be stonedto death; that God commanded Joshua to stone todeath children for the sin of their father; and tosack and burn the cities of Canaan, slaughteringmen, women and children. At no distant day, theBible will be made to deny that a God of immutablejustice and goodness ever did or could sanctionsuch deeds of treachery, of revenge and blood. Sucha book man's only rule of faith and practice, and thatrule infallible! Sad is human condition, if there beno surer guide to duty and to God than a book—thus changing with the changing opinions and circumstancesof mankind! It has ever been made to confirm to popularopinion only infallible But Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, orSolomon, comes to me and says—'I have a messagefrom God to you. God commands you to do so andso.' How am I to decide whether the command isfrom God? My first, my only test of all revelationsor inspirations is—Does the act, required to be done,accord with the Divine nature, with natural justiceand equity, with the unchanging relations and laws ofmy being? If prophet or apostle requires me to perpetratesome deed shocking to humanity, and to theprinciples of justice; if they require me to do whatthe reason and instincts of mankind pronounce to betreachery, then, robbery, murder and assassination,then I want no other proof that they are mistaken.God never ordered man to do that which is a violationof Divine and human nature, of natural justiceand equity, of every relation and sympathy betweenman and man. GOD IS EVER TRUE TO HIMSELF.He never ordered man to violate the essential elementsand laws of his being. I know that a God oflove and justice never commanded a father to disinheritall his children but one, and give all he had tothat one. I know such a Being never commanded afather to offer his son as a burnt offering to himself,even as a temptation. I know he never selected oneportion of his children, made them his special favorites,and sent them to exterminate another portionof his children, that they might reap where theysowed not, and enjoy the fruits of others' labor withoutcompensation. I know that a God of love andjustice never commanded one man, or set of men, togo to a neighbor's house, or town, set their housesor towns on fire, butcher all the men, women andchildren, and take possession for themselves. I knowthat a God of love and justice never commandedthe Israelites to invade the Canaanites—to burntheir dwellings, and slaughter the men, women andlittle ones, in order to make room for themselves. Iknow that Justice, Equity, and Goodness, nevermade it a sin to pity and spare helpless infancy, andmade mercy, kindness, gentleness, and pity, crimesamong men. Whoever or whatever attributes suchdeeds of treachery, of wrath, of cruelty of inhumanity,of revenge and murder, to infinite Benevolence,Justice, Equity, and Goodness, libels the Deity, andwould hold up a Demon, as the kind and loving Fatherof mankind. It is impossible that God, by expressrevelation, could thus deny his own nature, asthat is delineated in the physical, intellectual, socialand moral nature of man, and in the spirit andprecepts of the Christian Religion. THE SOULOF MAN SAYS, SLAVERY AND WAR AREWRONG; and the authority of no book in favor ofinjustice, cruelty, revenge, oppression and wholesalemurder, can stand before the authority of the humansoul in favor of justice, kindness, liberty, peace, humanlove and human brotherhood. The Bible mustgo down before the authority of the human soul, itthe Bible sanctions war or slavery. only Does the act, required to be done,accord with the Divine nature, with natural justiceand equity, with the unchanging relations and laws ofmy being? OD IS EVER TRUE TO HIMSELF. know know know know know know HUMANITY IS FAR BEING WORSHIPPED AS GOD BY THEJEWS—at that  and . He power Humanity  of these  to that bring by lers..No  off physion disquisitions,  tothem  wholesale pl, wrath, revenge,and butchery,—for such they would be regarded, ifperpetrated now, and such they were then, justice, equity, mercy, truth, goodness, are creatures at time and place, and change as the opinions,maxims and customs of men change. A pre-warand pre-slavery—a man-stealing and man-staying,man-imbruing, heathenish Church and Clergymay, for years to come, go on to sustain war andslavery, as divinely sanctioned practices, under thecover of texts from the Old Testament; but, eventually,Humanity will gain the victory over them.They, and their pre-war and pre-slavery texts, mustgo down before the stern behests of natural justiceand equity, and the unmistakable command of thatGod who speak in the human soul. But for thesupport derived to slavery from the Bible by thepro-slavery church and clergy of this land, that sumof all villainy had ceased to blight the earth, andscathe the hearts of men long of ago. Humanity hadere this pronounced its doom, and numbered it withthe crimes that were, but for that book, as it hasbeen construed. All the horrors which are embodiedin the word SLAVERY, have found their strongestsupport from that book. God and Humanity—naturalsympathy and affection, natural justice andequity—all the relations of man to man, and the obligationsand dunes growing out of those relations,have been and are still sacrificed upon the altar of abook. God and man have been regarded as mereappendages to the Bible. Both have been scarified,rather than admit the possibility that certain menmay have been mistaken.                     Where is the book that has caused the shedding ofso much human blood as the Old Testament? Notone can be found. It was a settled maxim, said tohave been given by God, that idolaters, and allenticers to idolatry, were to be put to death withoutpity—without mercy; it was a crime to pity or sparethem; and under the sanction of this supposed divinelaw, from the days of Moses, Joshua, Constantineand Charlemagne, down to the Puritans of N. England,professing Christians have caused theearth to flow down with the blood of their fellow-beings—all for the honor of God, and the spread ofhis worship. Under pretence of exterminating theenemies of God, to make room for his peculiar, favoritepeople, this entire continent has been depopulatedof its lens of millions of original inhabitants,since it was first discovered by Europeans, calledChristians. The mountains and valleys, the lakes andrivers, the main land and islands, from Cape Hornto the North Pole, have been made purple with humangore. Witness the influence of the Old Testamentin regard to idolaters! See the wars of theCrusaders, and the slaughter and burning of heretics,all under the Old Testament sanctions, not to sufferinfidels and idolaters to live. The tour quarters ofthe globe have been made a huge charnel house forman, under the sanctions of the Jewish Scriptures.Then, again, suffer not a witch to live! and underthe sanction of this supposed divine law, see thebrutal inhumanity and murders that have been perpetratedupon innocent, defenseless old men andwomen! It was the Bible that hung the witches atSalem, and the Quakers on Boston Common, asthat book was understood; it was the Bible thatsanctioned the murders of Cortez and Pizarro, inSouth America, and of the Puritans in North. Itwas the Bible—the Old Testament Bible—that kidnappedand transported and enslaved the Africans.It was the same text that led on the wars betweenCatholic and Protestant in Germany, in Britain andIreland. The foundation of the guillotine and thegallows is a text from the Bible. All the governmentsof human will, of violence and blood, that nowscourge Christendom with oppression, slavery, war,tears, groans and blood, have their sanctions in theBible. The Divinity of no nation that ever existed,ever instigated his worshippers to deeds of moreinhuman cruelty and injustice than the Being,worshipped as God by the Jews, and by misnamedChristians, is said to have instigated his devotees toperpetuate. peculiar suffer not a witch to live! the Old Testament Bible misnamed Why do professed Christians pretend such holyhorror of the God of Mahomet? You cannot, dearAndrew, find one single deed which Mahometansperpetrated under the sanction of their Divinity, whichJews and professing Christians have not committedunder the sanctions of their God. Talk of Mahometanharems—of Mahometan polygamy and concubinage!Go, read the history of Abraham, Jacob,Gideon, David and Solomon, and never again findfault with Mahometans, while yon admit that Godsanctioned their conduct. Talk of Mahometansspreading their religion by fire and sword! Go, readthe history of Moses and Joshua, and the conquest ofCanaan by the Jews. Talk of Mahometan cruelty,injustice, robbery, and murder! Go, read the destructionof the Midianites, Moabites, Amalekites,of Jericho, Ai, and the cities and towns of Canaan,as recorded in the books of Deuteronomy, Joshua,and Judges, and never talk of the horrors ofMahometanism, while you believe that the Beingwhom you worship as a God of love and justice instigatedand approved those deeds that are attributedto him in the Jewish record. Professing Christianscondemn themselves, while they condemn heathennations for their atrocities done under sanction oftheir idols; for, while they insist that their Godactually commanded and approved all which theysay is attributed to him by the Old Testament writers,they themselves declare that all the licentiousness,the pollutions, the cruelties, the thefts,robberies and murders; the outrages against humanityof idolatrous nations—were once Just, holy andgood; and were once perpetrated by the very Beingwhom they worship as God, and may again becommended by him; and that if they should be, itwould be their duty and privilege to do them. Thereis not a Divinity on the records of religion, that everperpetrated more unjust, unnatural, cruel and inhumandeeds than professing Christians insist thattheir God has perpetrated, and may perpetrate again. Dear Andrew, I would vindicate the Divine Authorof Christianity, the Father of men, for the comingof whose kingdom of Love and Peace, and HumanBrotherhood, I pray and labor, from the foulcharges brought against him by the advocates andapologists of War and Slavery. I know that Christianityand Humanity loathe the Being whom theycall God; or, rather, I would say, their low heathenish,brutal, conniptions of God. The God of Christianityand Humanity is Love, Justice, Goodness andTruth. He never did and never can, while he iswhat he is, sanction slavery or war. their low heathenish,brutal, conniptions of God. But I must stop now. I go to dice with friendsnear by, and with some little children. It is abright day. Indian corn is 25 cents (12 .) perbushel; perk, best kind, 2 cents (14.) per pound; bestbeef 3 and 4 cents, (2d.) per pound; Oats 12 1-2 to15 cents per bushel; best apples 10 and 12 cents perbushel, and you go into an orchard and take yourpick; good mutton one cent and  per pound, bestwheat 75 and 80 cents per bushel.

 The people of the whole country who are opposedto Slavery, should, for the next four years,sleep on their arms, and keep their slow-matchesburning. We ask the attention of our readers to the following.Read it for benefit in the future. It waswritten by the Hon. Charles Hudson, of Massachusetts,in April, 1847: But Slavery is never at rest. THE SOUTHARE DETERMINED TO KEEP THE REINSIN THEIR OWN HANDS, it possible; and seeingthe growing popularity of General Taylor theyhave thought it a favorable opportunity TO FORCEANOTHER SLAVEHOLDER UPON THEWHIG PARTY. We do not believe that theWhig party at the South, as such, have any suchdesign among them have this at heart. No itreason for the North to any whether they will beso dazzled with the glory acquired in an unjustwar, as to be cheated out at their rights, and beput into the hands at another slaveholding President.The present war has grown out of Slavery,and whether it continues till the next Presidentcourse into office, or whether it has terminated beforeby the acquisition of territory, it will be of vitalconsequence to the North, whether the Presidentbe a slaveholder, or a man opposed to thatinstitution. I this war, commenced to foster thatinstitution should continue, we want a man at thehead of our affairs who will no sacrifice thousandsof lives an millions of money to carry on the warfor such an inglorious purpose; and if peace ismade, and we acquire a large portion of territory,we want an Executive who will insist that that territoryshall not be cursed with slavery. LET THEFREEMEN OF THE NORTH LOOK WELLTO THIS. AND IF THEY DESIRE TOHAVE OUR GOVERNMENT DEVOTED TOTHAT INHUMAN INSTITUTION FOURYEARS MORE, LET THEM CHIME INWITH CERTAIN WIRE PULLERS ATTHE SOUTH, and ADVOCATE THE NOMINATIONOF GENERAL TAYLOR. Let themremembers that a new paper has been started atWashington, under the auspices of certain slaveholdinggentlemen, and those devoted to their interest,to aid the cause of the hero of Buena Vista, andthat no pains will be spared in Tennessee, in Kentucky,in Virginia, and other Southern States tobring the Whig party into that nomination. Let theNorthern Whigs look wall to this; and if they havehalf the watchfulness that their Southern friendspossess, they will at once enter their protest againstSuch a measure. THE NORTH HAVE BEENRULED BY THE SOUTH LONG ENOUGH.It is time that the majority should rule. A nationboasting of free institutions has already shed blondand wasted treats a enough, to sustain an institutionat war with the first principles of our Constitution.We have felt the iron heal of slavery longenough, one would think, to induce us to asset ourrights and to act like freemen. CHIME INWITH CERTAIN WIRE PULLERS ATTHE SOUTH, and ADVOCATE THE NOMINATIONOF tobring the Whig party into that nomination. they will at once enter their protest againstSuch a measure. 

 for the consideration of this opinion. The the Sabbath, as rather, the 'Anti-Sabbath Con-by that  but it always, in my ,more the wrong . It was not intended, so the asI know, by say, to 'do away with the Sabbath,' butonly to do away with a superstition connected withits supposed special divine authority, and some legalenactments connected show with; and the wholemovement, as I understand it, grow out of certainobstructions to free speech, or indeed any speech; onthat day, on certain subjects of vital and reformatoryimportance, which were considered inconsistent withthe holiness of the time! Its object then was, topromote such a view of the Sabbath as should makeit even more instrumental-in righteousness and truth.It should not, therefore, I think, have been called an'anti' Sabbath convention.              anti But as it was, it accomplished good; it opened theeyes of many to more rational views of the objectsand observances of that day; it brought in collateralsubjects; it exposed a great in the hands ofthe priesthood, must unjustly abused by them; andit was the means of exciting many to deeper thoughtand reflection. It was certainly an unpopular subjectfor a tion; the connection took a veryunpopular  but, notwithstanding all this, wewere surprised to find so many in attendance, and soquiet a time. I received, I remember, at the time,that nothing could have been more unpopular, noteven a convention to consider the claims of the Bibleto divine authority. In this last matter, a greatsubject of curiosity would have been proposed—amatter which has excited the attention of all reflectingminds, and crowds would have flocked to havehad their doubts confirmed or removed, and themeeting would have been comparatively popular.But think of an anti-Sabbath convention! Yet notwithstandingthe unpopularity of the name, and as Ithink, a misnomer, we were rejoiced to see so goodlyand quiet an attendance.   nothing anti-Sabbath misnomer But a feeling pervaded my own mind, all thetime, that the true ground of the evil sought to beremoved, had not been removed, had not been reached.I well remember, too, a remark of Parker Pillsbury,in a speech on the occasion, one evening'We have attacked (said he) the church and theclergy, and now we've come to the Sabbath, but wehaven't laid the axe at the root of the matter yet.' Thatis true. That root of the matter is the Bible; or rather,the Bible as commonly received—the Bible as authority—the Bible as our Master—the Bible as an infalliblebook as a unit, as the production of the DivineMind, as a perfect whole. This is, truly enough,the foundation of the most evil, the most abstractionto all good reform, the most sectarian division andstrife, the most war and bloodshed. It is the Bible,in the sense, that has given rise to the church; it isthe church that has produced the clergy; and it isthe clergy that has cursed the land with their arrogance,inhumanity and conceit. This is going tothe foundation of the evil. It is high time that thissubject was introduced to a popular convention bythe reformers. But I would not have it called ananti-Bible convention. No, sir, I would not doaway with the Bible, any more than with the Sabbath.I would simply do away with the preposterousidea that the Bible is the production of the DivineMind—a unit—a perfect and infallible whole, evenafter allowing the exceptions generally conceded, oferrors and interpretations in the various transcribings.I agree with you, my dear sir, that the Biblenever was intended for any such thing, that it issimply a collection of Jewish and Christian writings,issued hundreds and thousands of years apart, withno design, and no idea, on the part of the writers, orof the Deity, that they should ever be bound up intoa book, to be used as authority, to trammel men'sthoughts, or to be exclusively read in churches. most anti-Bible I agree also with you, that, in losing our traditionaland educational notions of this book, we maygreatly gain in our estimation of it; and I am surethat there are certain high, psychological principleswhich may be applied to its relations, which will elevateeven many passages, and some books of theOld Testament, to a high and sacred ground. Andthose principles, in our time, are getting, every day,to be better and better understood. But it is not my purpose here to offer a theory ofinterpretation, but simply to say what I have said,that a Bible convention is now called for, as indispensablynecessary to subserve the cause of universalreform I would call it a Bible convention, inthe same sense in which I would call a physiologicalconvention, or a scientific convention, where theobjects might be, while many things were opposed,not to oppose all science, but to consider the generalsubject. And I am sure, let it be called in the sameof Reform, in the name of Anti-Slavery, in thename of Peace, in the name of Temperance, inthe name of all Social Progress; and let it be withthe greatest seriousness and deliberation, befittingso high a subject—one so closely connected with themost sacred impressions and prejudices of the people,and we may confidently rely on a full attendance,an interested meeting, and a profit to the cause ofhumanity, which will be felt in every branch asmovement of the progress.

 PAINESVILLE, (Ohio,) Nov. 18, 1848. AINESVILLE MR. GARRISON: ARRISON DEAR SIR—I have noticed with surprise, the publication,in the Liberator of an article signed by D.Ruggles, in which my name is mentioned. The article,no far as I am conserved, is grossly false, and Ihave good reason to believe that Ruggles know it tobe so when he published It. I will make a briefstatement of the facts, and leave you to act as yoursense of justice shall dictate. EAR IR I became satisfied that I could not spend as muchtime at Northampton as there was prospect I shouldbe obliged to, to receive benefit from the treatment,and proposed leaving on Monday morning, and settledmy bills the day previous. Wilcox offered toget a horse and buggy, and carry me to town to takethe cars. He did so; and the first intimation I hadof his leaving that morning was, on the read to townhe stopped to get a bundle of clothing. When Ifound that he was going to leave in that manner, Iprotected against it, and entreated him to return,selling him that Ruggles would think that I was concernedwith him. I told him that If he did not goback, I would not go off to such a manner. He saidthat Ruggles had  him; that he was keepinghim to got his money from M; that Dr. Dennistontold him that he was well, and 'ought' to have leftlong ago, &c. &c. I found that as permission ofmine would turn him from his purpose; and beinganxious to reach New York this evening, I went on.He procured some one to drive the hares back. Ihad intended to pay. Wilcox the horse-hire, but, onhe would not return, I sent the money by the manwhom he had filled to drive the  back, requestinghim to hand it to the owner for the die of him,end  the said. I saw as move &Wilcox, untilwe ved at , when I saw him get outof a  the. I hereby spoke . I hadto more , I was no more respectable for his yourself; be leaving against mystrongest with him most earnest . I wasanxious to be in New York that night, and did not as I could not  (arrived in New York, I as they  that I had  in had and get the pay for,him, Who would let me know, I would remit it fromOhio, not wishing that he should suffer less, although ( the not know the owner's, or I should have written him.) I supposedthat I  power to exculpate myselffresh even  is this matter, and it had passedentirely from my , until a short time since myattention was called to the fact of my name beingdragged before the readers of Massachusetts newspapersin such dishonorable connection.                           I have no fear of the publication of such chargedoing me any injury in the mind of any one whoknows me, and I hate to sleep so low as to deny sograce a slander. Were it differently situated, Ishould protected him at once for the libel, but hisonce seems a hard one for this life, and excites sympathyrather than sterner feelings. He has had minefor years, ever since I was acquainted with his situation,else I should not have visited his establishmentas I did, very unfortunately for me, as it seems.Still, he has done me great injustice, which oughtto be rectified in same manner. knows me I have thus made as short a statement of the factsas I can intelligibly do. You can satisfy yourself asto its truth, and do what your sense of proprietyshall direct. Respectfully yours, S.MARSHALL [☞It is only an act of simple justice to MrMarshall, to publish his letter entire. We are gladto receive this explanation, because the brief acquaintancewe formed with him at Northampton ledus to regard him as a man of true self-respect andintegrity. The behavior of Mr. Wilcox appears tobe inexcusable. We hope he will speedily redeemhis character by making the amanda honorable toDr. Ruggles, whom he has so wrongfully defrauded.]—Ed.

 A victim of your power and oppression humblycraves your attention a few words In behalf ofhimself and three millions of his brethren whomyou hold in attain and slavery) with respect as theelection just completed. In doing so, I desire tobe regarded as addressing you individually and collectively.'It I should seem severe remember thatthe iron of slavery has pierced and rankled in myheart, and that I not only smart under the recollectionof a long and cruel enslavement, but an evennow passing my life in a country, and among a peoplewhose prejudices against myself and peoplesubject me to a thousand poisonous stings. If Ispeak harshly, my excuse is, that I speak in fettersof your own forging. Remember that oppressionboth the power to make even a wise man mad. In the selection of your national rulers, just completed,you have male another broad mark on thepage of your nation's history, and have given tothe would and the coming generation a certain testby which to determine your present integrity as apeople. That actions speak founder than words—that within the character of the representative maybe seen that of the constituency—that no peopleare better than their laws or law-makers—that astream cannot rise higher than its source—that asweet fountain cannot sent forth bitter waters,and that a tree is to be known by his fruits, aretruisms; and in their light let us examine the characterand pretensions of your boasted Republic. As a people, you claim for yourselves a highercivilization—a purer morality—a deeper religiousfaith—a larger love of liberty, and a broader philanthropy,than any other nation on the globe. Ina word, you claim yours to be a model Republic,and promise, by the force and excellence of yourinstitutions, and the purity and brightness of yourexample, to overthrow the thrones and despotismsof the old world, and institute your own in theirstead. Your missionaries, are found in the remotestparts of the party, while your land swarms withchurches and religious institutions. In words ofReligion an Liberty, you are abundant and preeminent.You have long desired to get rid of theodium of being regarded as pro-slavery, and haveeven insisted that the charge of pro-slavery madeagainst you was a slander, and that those who madein were actuated by a wild and fanatical spirit. Tomost of your innocence appear, you have now had afair community. The issue of freedom or slaveryhas been clearly submitted to you, and you havedeliberately chosen slavery. General Taylor and General Cass were the chosenand admitted southern and slavery candidatesfor the Presidency. Martin Van Buren, thought farfrom being an abolitionist, yet in some sort representedthe anti-slavery idea of the North, in a politicalform—but you have rejected, and elected aslaveholder to rule over you in hi stead. Whenthe question was whether New Mexico and Californiashall be free or slave States, you have rejectedhim who was solemnly pledge to maintain theirfreedom, and have chosen a man whom you knewto be pledged, by his position, to the maintenanceof slavery. By your votes, you have said that slaveryis better than freedom—that war is better thanpeace, and that cruelty in better than humanity,You have given your sanction to slave rule andslavery propagandism, and interposed whatever ofmoral character and standing you possess, to shieldthe reputation of slaveholders generally. You havesaid, that to be a man-stealer is no crime—to trafficin human flesh shall be a passport, rather than abarrier, to your suffrages. To slaveholders youhave said. Chain up you men and women, and beforethe bloody lash drive them to new fields oftoil in California and New Mexico. To the slavein his chains you have said, Be content in yourchains, and if you dare to gain your freedom byforce, whether in New Mexico or California, innumbers indicated by our votes our muskets shallfind you out. In a word, you have again renewedyour determination to support the Constitution ofthe United States, in its parts of freedom to thewhites and slavery to the blacks. If General Taylorslaves run away, you have prod again toreturn them to bondage. While General Tayloris the well-known robber of three hundred humanbeings of all their hard earnings, and is coiningtheir hard earnings into gold, you have conferredupon him an office worth twenty-five thousand dollarsa year, and the highest honor in your power.By this act you have endorsed his character andHistory. His murders in Mexico—his bloodhound'cruelty in the Florida war—his awful profanitytogether with the crunes attendant upon a slaveplantation, such as their, robber, murder and adultery,you have sanctioned as perfectly consistentwith your morality, humanity, liberty, religion andcivilization. You have said that the most availableand suitable person in all this great nation, to presaleover this model Republic, is a warrior, slaveholderswearer, and bloodhound importer. Duringthe campaign just ended your leaders havedubbed this man-stealer as an honest man, and manyof you have shouted over the LIE as being a truth,thus destroying all moral distinctions. To talk ofa veracious far, a pious blasphemer, a righteousrobber, a candid by pocrite, a sober drunkard, or ahuman criminal, would be quite as just and regionalas to call and admitted man-stealer an honestman. Yet, in the wildness of a wicked enthusiasm,you have given your countenance and supportto this.  honest man Now, is it too much to say that you have madehis crimes your own, and that the blood of theslave is on your garments? You have covered histheft with honesty, his blasphemy with piety, and,as far as in your power, you have rendered theblows intended to destroy slavery nugatory and innoxious.Before high Heaven and the world, youare responsible for the blood of the slave. Youmay shut your eyes to the fact, sport over it, sleepover it, but so sure as there is a God of Justice andan unerring Providence, just so sure will the bloodof the bondman be required at your hands. Anopportunity was presented to you by which youcould have fixed and indelible mark of your utterdetestation of slavery, and given a powerful blowto that bitter cures. This you have failed to do.When Christ and Brabbas were presented, youhave cried out in your , Give us Burabbs,the robber, in preference to Christ, the innocent.The perishing slave, with uplifted hands an bleedingheart, implored you, in the name of the Godyou profess to serve, and the humanity you professto cherish, not to add this mill-stone to the weightalready crushing his heart and hopes. But he hasappointed in vain. You have turned a deaf our tohis cries, hundred your hearts to his appeal, turnedyour back upon his sorrows, and united withthe tyrant to perpeate his enslavement. The effortsmade in your presence to impress you withthe awful sin of slavery, and to awaken you to asense of your duty to the oppressed, have thus farbeen unavailing. You continue to fight againstGod, and declare that injustice exclaimed a nation,and that sin is an honor to any people.     injustice exclaimed honor Do you really think to circumvent ? Doyou suppose that you can, go on in  amountcurour of injustice and political prodi? He the law of righteous  he inrepeated from the statutes of the Al Owhat mean  the; ye brain and bind any people?Will justice sleep for ever? O that you would laythese things to !

Youhave  but the cause is not dead. Though and bleeding at your fear, she shall riseagain, and going before you, shall give you no resttill you break every yoke and let the oppressed gofree. The anti-slavery societies, of the land willrise up and spring to action again, sending forthfrom the press, and on the voice of the livingspeaker, words of burning truth to slave the guilty,in unmask the hypocrite to expose the founds ofpolitical parties, and rebuke the spirit of a corruptand  sustaining church and clergy.

At present,the great manufacturing towns and districts haveescaped the scourge, and we sincerely trust thatthey will continue to be exempted from its attacks.The malady, however, has appeared on the northerncoast of France, at Dunkirk. Only 16 cases of cholera had occurred in Hamburgsince the first of the month, making the totalnumber of cases, 3,362, of which 1,671 have been fatal. A letter dated Dantsic, the 3d inst., states that thecholera is raging in that city with intense violence.There were no fewer than 62 new cases in one day388 individuals had already been attacked, of whom185 died, 34 recovered, and 179 were under care.

 We understand that the Orthodox Quakers generallyand a great proportion of the members ofthe Hksite division, voted for Brigadier GeneralZachary Taylor, of the United States army; the! hero of he Mexican war, the officer bywhose advice the United states army was orderedform Corpus Christ to the Rio Grande; and thewar with Mexico begun—by whose advice and urgentrequest, bloodhounds, were imported intoFlorida to hunt the Indians; the Louisiana slaveholderand slave-buyer; the chosen instrument ofthe slave holders to preserve and extend slavery;as their candidate for the presidency. Thesepeaceful followers of George Fox and WilliamPenn, the men who canonize John Woolman, EdwardBurroughs, Anthony Benezet, and WarnerMfllm, have publicly declared themselves fullyrepresented by the warrior of Buena Vista, andLouisiana slaveholder, whose only experience isin the discipline of the slave plantation, and theart of human slaughter, and whose only laurels arestained with human blood. Yet these men have'testimonies,' against slavery and war and militarypreparations, and the bearing of arms, and sorigid are they, that a member of their society layshimself liable to discipline and expulsion, for eitherperforming military service or paying a militaryfine, though non-payment would subject himto a great pecuniary loss. No excuses of policyor apparent advantage will justly, in their eyes,either of these volitions of principle. Are theytoo blind to see how they are thus sowing tares intheir own wheat-field, encouraging the martialspirit, and admiration for the achievements of thewarrior, and thus more than neutralizing all theirpacific lessons, and making slaveholding a reputablebusiness instead of an odious crime, and thusencouraging the slaveholder, and offering a bountyfor others to imitate his tyranny?    While they exalt the slaveholder and slave-buyerto the highest political honors, and bestowthe richest rewards upon military exploits, of whatworth are all their sermons and 'testimonies' and'queries'? Men get their impressions of truthand virtue more from practical examples thanfrom theoretical instructions, and no words ofpeace of freedom can prevent the fatal influenceof this practical commendation of war anti-slavery.It is worse than destroying with one hand what isreared with the other; it not only sweeps awaythe good their won hands had constructed, buttears up the very foundation on which othersmight build. It disturbs all faith in moral principle. It is not alone that the warrior and tyrant issuccessful, and secures, the highest pinnacle of politicalambition, but his supporters will, of course,attempt a defence of their own action, in whichthey must apologize for the blackest crimes of theage, and eulogize their perpetrator as a paragon ofvirtue and manly excellences. We cannot imagineaction and teaching more directly demoralizingto those who practice and to those who witnessit. While the wise and accomplished statesman,and the true patriot and philanthropist, areleft in obscurity, the bloody warrior and petty despotis elevated to supreme power, and coveredwith fulsome praise. While the advocates of politicalreturns, for freedom and brotherly love, arespurned and repulsed the man-slaver and man-enslaveris welcomed and glorified. From avowed fighters and pro-slavery men, weexpect nothing better, but he evil in this case isgreatly aggravated by the moral standing, respectability,and high professions of those who engage init. They may rejoice for their success as Whigs,but they may mourn for their shameful defeat asFriends. They may secure a financial policywhich will increase their wealth, and give an impetusto the greedy scramble of trade, but it is at afearful cost to morality and pure religion, by a sadviolence to their own hearts. It would be easy forany one to see how the election of notoriouscounterfeiter or burglar, (whose only  wasfrom success in his crimes,) to the Presidency,must demoralize the nation, and pro not onlythe peculiar crimes he had practiced, but all formsof vice and wickedness. Why it is less apparent this care? The political economist may mournfor the election of ignorant and incompetent rulers,but it is a trifling evil, compared to the electionof immoral once. The moral bearings of anelection are always more important than its economical,and it is greatly to be regretted that thistruth I so seldom heeded. The Quakers wereonce foremost in their perception of it, and in theirpractical fidelity to Christians morality; but 'howhas the fine gold become dim!' 'How is thefaithful city because a !

 A BLACK REPRESENTATIVE.—A Paris paper ofOctober 20, states that at the sitting of the FrenchNational Assembly of the preceding day, a considerablemovement took place to the Chamber, inconsequence of the appearance of M. Mozuline,whose admission was lately pronounced for thecolony of Martinique. The representative, who isof the very blackest hue, walked up to the extremeend of he Chamber, and took his rent immediatelyunder the clock. His features were then visible,and presents to view the true negro type. Themovement through the Chamber continued to increase,and arrived at its highest pitch when thenew commer coolly drew out an eye-glass, and proceededto leisurely examine the different parts ofthe Assembly.

 In Kentucky, organizations have been made forgrating to Califor, and a 'California EmigratingSociety' is established. Farther North thetious will be created, to move into thenew territory arud bands of slaveholders. ThePhlphia Republic says, with truth and force:—[Albany Atlas.      The slaveholders know what they are about.Their deadly resistance to the Proviso is not anabstraction, and accordingly we find them organizingColonization Societies for the purpose of occupyingthe ground and arraying their forces onthe spot for the earliest and most desperate effortsto extend their system into the new country. It isto be occupied as Texas was, and for the same persons.All they want is done to crowd the landwith their slaves. The invasion is already arranged,and while the North is debating whether theProviso is necessary, and whether Taylor willveto it, the propagats are busy pushing forwardtheir nefarious enterprise. It is not a non-committal,unfledged President that will arrest themischief. Delay decisive legislative action as longas the Oregon bill was hanging in Congress, andthe question will be one of abolition at slavery,which, by that time, will have ud the ground,and planted itself upon the right of possession.Actual, absolute, immediate prohibition—the WilmotProviso now, is the only security: every pretenceand profession that delays the decision is acheat. The annexation of Texas was accomplishedby steah. When Adams and G, andone or two other members of Congress, first warnedthe country of the design, it seemed so impossiblethat it was unheaded, but within a year ortwo from the time when the purpose was demonstrated,the scheme had trimph over all obstacles,and the iniquity was consummated.'       

 AN Agent of the MASSACHUSETTS A.S. SOCIETY,will lecture as follows: ASSACHUSETTS OCIETY Table  Table  

 To utter an opinion which shall be in the maincorrect, it seems to me that our tting sin isth: we have confounded government of self witha government made by ourselves; and we do not clearly as we ought, that the latter can neverbe permanent and healthy unless it results from theformer. It is possible to conceive of a people whohave emancipated themselves from every restraintand tradition of authority, who acknowledge nothingas their ter but the aggregate of their privatewills cred in the single man of their choice,who make and unmake their laws by the power ofsuffrage, who enjoy unparallel led couort and prosperity,who have the right of unlimited development,in public, social, and external forms—andyet they may be an sludoned people, with theirpublic freedom constantly degenerating into licenseand misrule, into the oppression and tyranny of anirresponsible majority, into violation of the freedomof the defenc, into the organization of sinsinstead of virtues, because they are not truly free;they may be the slaves of their passions, their prises,and their unconverted wills.

 Of course, our Whig friends rejoice and exult atthe result of the election. Nightly do they sing,or dance, or fiddle, or drum, or 'pfife,' or shootover it. Hard as the money market is, they spendis freely for powder and other instrumentalities, tocreate 'n and confusion.' Perhaps this is allright, and no one ought to complain but let them'go it while they are young.' Some of them haverejoiced so heartily as to burn their old hats.Prominent once now say they don't want the FreeSoilers to go back—they can do without them;nor do they want those. Whigs who did not vote atall. All such they can do without. Having 'oldZack' and 'Whitey' on their side, they seem tothink they can flail all creation.  Admitting they have achieved a victory, on whatprinciples have they secured it? On the old hightariff Whig principles? on the bank or sub-treasuryissue? or on any other leading Whig doctrine?No: nor yet was it on the free territory question.The leading and only incentive to action was,whether Zachary Taylor should be President, andthat is all there is of it—'old Zack,' and 'nothingelse.' This is the only bond of union among theWhigs, North and South, East and West; at least,so far as is visible. The Whigs, in the momentary exultation of anideal triumph, are asking—'Where will your FreeSoil party be in four years?' They claimed to beTHE Free Soil party before the election, but nowseem to rejoice in the notion, that it will be forgotand buried in a short time. No doubt many desiresuch a consummation; with what consistency,then, did they claim to be friends of freedom beforethe election? Their talk now shows thatthey were either insincere then, or they are now,for they ridicule Free Soil men and their measures.Many Whigs, no doubt, are sincere loversof liberty; but there are others who do rejoice thatTaylor is elected—that the South has triumphed—and that the slave is further prostrated, if possible,than he was before, in the dust of oppression. Theanti-slavery professions of such were a sham, amask of hypocrisy, to deceive and mislead the unwaryinto the support of a man, who, of necessity,has for forty years been a tyrant—because no mancan be general of an army, unless he is a tyrant;and who now oppresses near 300 persons as goodas himself, not because he has the right, but for thereason that he has the power to do so.—New LisbonAurora. rejoice New LisbonAurora.

 What are the city authorities about when thenight is made hideous, and peaceable citizens, togetherwith the sick and the dying, are disturbed bythe horrid ravings of madmen? Should a man ofGod appear in our streets during the day or evening,and preach everlasting truth and righteousnessto a crowd of thirty people, he would, undoubtedly,be hauled to the watch-house or theprison, as a disturber of the peace; but two, fiveor ten hundred mad dupes and tools of a bloodstainedpolitical demagogue may collect togetheron any day or evening in the week except Priest-day,or at midnight if they choose, and march thro'the streets with all manner of noisy instruments,and with shoots and yells that drive the very dogsyelping to their kennels, and startle the sick and dyingwith affright, and not a word is and against it byour city fathers! Why all this difference? Simplybecause truth and righteousness are unpopular, andthe preacher of this rare doctrine would stand alone,or nearly so, with few or none to befriend him,while sin is popular, the multitude being sold tothe devil to work wickedness, and are not to be interferedwith by the city authorities. A preacherof godliness might be dragged to jail, but few wouldcare for it; but if the 'Fathers' should attempt tocheck the rowdy spirit of political Bedlamites, amob would be raised, and the Mayor and his possemight be forced to exchange their glossy, superfineand white gloves for garments composed oftar and feathers. On the evening of last Seventh day (called Saturday)the pensioned tools of the notorious Taylorexcited the spirit of rowdyism which is ever onthe look-out in this city, by illuminating the windowsof their printing offices. A crowd was sooncollected by these means, and while gaping andgazing at the lights, a legion of evil spirits seemedto enter into them as they did into the ancient herd;but instead of rushing violently down the hill, tobe choked by the sea, they took a different direction.They summoned to their aid those bedlamitescalled musical bands, at a late hour in the evening,and struck up their build din, and with shoots andyells that would have disgraced a band of madsavages, marched up one street and down anothertill a late hour, disturbing weary people that neededrest, and shattering the nerves of the sick, drivingsleep from their weary couches, and introducinga night of greater weariness and pain. I do not learn that any officer of the city madethe least attempt to suppress such outrageous conduct,and am told there is to be a greater pow-wowto-morrow night. If so, it is to be hoped they willretire beyond the bounds of civilization, and notoutrage the rights of decent people with their mosthorrid noise. I do not object to this mad expression of the basepassions that are burning in them, on political orparty ground, for it is nothing to me whether thebloodhounds, the wolves or the dogs have the pickingof the carcase; but I would bear a testimonyagainst such proceedings by any and all parties onaccount of their evil effects; they not only outragethe rights of decent people, but nurse thespirit of rowdyism, corrupt hot-blooded youth,lead unstable men from their homes and families,and send hundreds to drown their little remnant ofreason in the poison howl. Scores of men were inthe grog shops and gambling rooms at 12 o'clockthat night, that would have been at home withtheir families, if that mad, disgraceful scene hadnot been enacted. Neither do I refer to the city authorities becauseI believe in them, but to call the attention of thelaw-loving citizens to their worthless laws, thatwould imprison a man for preaching righteousnessin the streets, or a mischievous boy for ringing aneighbor's door-bell in sport, and then permitthese madmen to disturb the whole city with theirdemoralizing rows.—Portland Pleasure-Boat.

 Bro. C. Spear will deliver a discourse in theUniversalist church in Sandwich, next Sabbath afternoon,on Prison Reform, and in the Unitarianchurch in the evening, on the Literature of theprison. 

 James W. Walker, of Ohio, a faithful anti-slaverylecturer in that State, communicates to the Buglesome curious incidents in the course of his tour.Here is a sample:— There was one circumstance which transpiredwhile we were at Richfield, which I cannot butmention, as it portrays so vividly the character ofthe priesthood, who, being ex officio righteous, feelspecially called upon to cry after all reformers,'Infidel!' and to warn their 'dear people' of thedanger to which they stand exposed in hearing theComeouters. When H.C. Wright and C.C. Burleighwere at Bath, a Rev. Mr. P. then in the employof the Baptist church at Richfield, as theirPastor, stood up and warned the people againstfriends Wright and Burleigh as Infidels, &c., &c.On the very day we were at the Convention, theChurch had this Reverend defender of the flockup for the most flagrant crimes. The circumstanceswere as follows: The Rev. gentleman hadrepresented himself from the East, where he hadsold a large farm for over 80 dollars per acre. Heboarded with quite a respectable Baptist family,members of his church, to the lady of which, hehad given leave to read, if she felt disposed, hismanuscript sermons. He had been engaged inhis room writing, and having gone out, the ladypicked up what the supposed to be a sermon,which, however, turned out to be a letter, writtento his wife's lather, purporting to be written from aplace near the city of Cincinnati. He representedhimself as being head clerk in an extensive mercantileestablishment at a high salary. He alsostated that he had bought a farm, and was goingthe next day to Cincinnati to have the dead recorded,&c. The Rev. Brother represented, in themost glaring style, the mighty influence he wasgaining among all classes. That he had preachedto a densely crowded congregation in the largegalleried Presbyterian house only the day before—that he had invitations to preach from all denominations,and the people looked upon him as ayoung Cicero!!! And much more of the namekind. Of course, the sister's eyes were openedwide. He attended the session on Saturday, andbravely told them that they had nothing to do withthe matter, as the time for which he was hired hadexpired that day! So the Rev. scoundrel took hisdeparture, to palm himself on some other gulliblecongregation that 't able to take care of themselves.I pity the poor people who have beenthus undeceived; and that, the just when theywere on the ere of a roit; this is a fair specious of the men whether thecry of Infidel against the men and lives are unblemished, and whose unfurnished. ex officio very day Cicero!!!     On Friday the 20th, the commenced of thoseday's meeting at Andover, was a meeting called by the Society of The Rev. Mr. Harrington was in occupied about half the time in defeand others for voting the Free Soil. He the Constitution was pro-slavery. Still terthan the people, and we went up to people up to it.        I never saw more fully the who defend voting under the Constitution. Harrington is a liberal-minded able to make the best of his position.    I am sure all the non-voters were in their position.

 The Pennsylvania Freeman gives us a gentleh for having so dull a conscience respecting theuse of slave labor produce. It copies an itemfrom a late No. of the Christian, and glances anarrow at us, as will be seen below.  REFORMATORY.—The Editor of the ChristianFreeman has been asked, on a case of conscience,whether it would be right for a strict temperanceman to sell timber to a cooper to make up intorum casks. The Editor says he has not 'instinctivediscernment' enough to decide so nice a point.We should think a plain NO was the-only tolerableanswer. A man who well sell grain to be distilledinto intoxicating liquor, or timber to encask it,fails to discountenance intemperance 'in all suitableways.'—Practical Christian. EFORMATORY. Practical Christian. The Practical Christian decides that point withoutany hesitation. One would think it quite aseasy to say No, to the question, is it right for abolitioniststo pay the slaveholder the price of theproducts of his stolen labor, because they are a littlecheaper than the products of honest industry.Yet our good friend Ballou lacks the 'instinctivediscernment' to answer this. Why can he not seeas clearly the wrong of this connection with sin,as in the case he names? Surely it is quite as direct,and abstinence from it as practicable. Cannot our Free Produce friends discriminatecorrectly, or is the obfuscation all in our mentalvision? We could not sell stave timber to workup into rum casks, or our grain to be manufacturedinto whiskey. Why? Because these usesof our stave timber and grain are evil, SINFUL; andwe cannot be innocent in knowingly selling usefulsubstances for sinful purposes. But the distillerhas some old rejected liquor casks, which are suitablefor keeping soap. We need casks for thatpurpose, which is a good purpose, and these aremuch cheaper than new ones. So we go and purchasehis old ruin casks for soap barrels. Wetestify faithfully against his sinful business, andtell him that while we can sell him nothing tomake a bad use of, we can sell to him or buy ofhim anything to make a good use of. We are inconsistent,are we? If we cannot furnish him formoney our stave timber and grain to pervert tosinful uses, we cannot buy his rejected liquor casksto put to a good use! We do not understand suchlogic. our evil bad good good Again; we cannot sell ship timber to build aknown slaver, nor help kidnap slaves, nor furnisharticles to be worked into slave whips, brandingirons, torture collars and hand cuffs, nor recognizea slaveholder as a suitable member in the ChristianChurch, or in a republican State. But, says brotherFree Producer, 'you can purchase and use cottoncloth manufactured out of cotton raised byslave labor! You have no scruples of conscienceagainst this!' No. If we can buy it as an out-spokenanti-slavery man, without compromise orconcealment, we have no scruples against doingso. It is a good thing, which we need for a gooduse, and which we obtain without abating or suppressingour testimony against slavery, or cottonmill oppression. 'But you know that the cottonwas raised by slaveholders, by means of slave labor.'Yes, and we know that it was manufacturedinto cloth without paying all the operatives a fullequivalent for their labor. Shall we thereforescruple to buy and use it for a good purpose?'But you thereby and others in enriching the wickedcotton grower, and so confirm him in slave-holding.'Shall we not do the same thing if wetrade at all with people who trade with slave-holders?Why not? We buy broadcloth whichwas paid for in England with southern cotton.The slaveholder sold his cotton to a trader, whotook it to Liverpool, and exchanged it for broadcloth.He brought the broadcloth to Boston,whence it came to Milford, where we buy a pieceof it for a new coal. In this case we do not enrichand encourage the slaveholder, do we? A slave-holderswaps a slave for four horses, or for ten silverwatches, or for five bales of linen goods. Nowwe may innocently buy one of these horses, watches,or a bale of linen goods; but if we buy a cottonshirt, or a pint of rice, or a pound of sugar, we buystolen goods, and as a partaker are guilty with theslaveholder of the great transgression. We confesswe do not see how men and women of sensecan reason in this way. We respect their tendernessof conscience, but we cannot respect theirlogic. If the fault is in our own head or heart,Heaven grant us a speedy deliverance. We wantto go all lengths with a right conscience. But wedo not believe a thoroughly enlightened conscienceever quarrels with a thoroughly enlightened reason.Brother Freeman, if we are wild and inconsistent,do not let us off without due correction. stolen goods

 Our eloquent friend Frederick Douglass has beendoing good service to the anti-slavery cause in thisCommonwealth, recently, by his soul stirring lectures.We make the following extract from his lastletter in the North Star:— I found Lynn, as usual at such times, wrapt inexcitement on the subject of 'Free Soil;' and likeall other towns where much Anti-Slavery efforthas been expended, a large Free Soil vote was cast,leading both the old parties. While here, I had anopportunity of hearing a few remarks from thatonce great, but now fallen man, Daniel Webster.He was in Lynn for the purpose of gaining thevotes of the freemen of that city for the slaveholder,Zachary Taylor. Mr. Webster's appearancemade me sad. In gazing upon him, I forgot hiswords in the contemplation of himself. A thunder-shiveredcolumn stood before me. There was justenough of the fine chiseling left to proclaim thewonderful skill of the artist. But what a wreck!—what a magnificent ruin! The outline of his formergreatness might be traced over the vast areaof his brow, while through the windows of hissoul might be seen large masses of his giant power,fast mouldering to decay. He has arrayed himselfagainst God, and is broken. He has trifled withhis moral sense, and destroyed his conscience.Once he was the servant of freedom—now he isthe servant of slavery. His words go one road,while his convictions go another; and as a housedivided against itself must fall, so Daniel Websterhas fallen. His greatest service to mankind willbe found in the loud warning which his ruin proclaimsas liable to all who follow his dangerousexample. His case shows that intellect, howeverstrong—that genius, however exalted—that friends,however numerous—that wealth, however abundant,can never fill up the chasm of a want of fixedmoral principle. A thunder-shiveredcolumn stood before me. We extract from the letter another paragraph:— My meetings in New Bedford, like all Anti-Slaverymeetings which it has been my privilegeto attend in that place, were very satisfactory.There is something in old associations that alwaysrefreshes and cheers me, when I stand in the midstof that community where not ten years ago, I stooda stranger newly from slavery. I never so fullyrealize the difference of my position now from whatit was then, as when I stand in the midst of a NewBedford assembly. What I was and am is knownto them. There are no doubts in the minds of myhearers with respect to myself to be removed.They know me and hear me as a competent witnessagainst the whole system of slavery and all itsabettors. I was assisted in my meetings in NewBedford by Charles Lenox Rarsond, a man whonever fails to command the sympathy and attentionof an audience in that place. I missed one facefrom the meetings, which detracted somewhat fromthe happiness with which I usually look upon asanti-slavery audience there. It was the face ofthat veteran laborer and faithful pioneer in the.

  Hi. The  papers, with an introduction, , and was Index, by  Wilber, A.M.  theGovt Church in  and respectively Memberof many literary, learned and scientific Cambridge Published by George '            pg.163. We have received a copy of this unique andmirth-stirring, as well as most instructive work,from the venerable editor himself, with his 'respex,'which we reciprocate in full. All the piecescontained in it, we believe, were copied into theLiberator as they successively appeared originallyeither in the Boston Courier or the National Anti-SlaveryStandard; so that our readers (we modestlytaking it for granted that they carefully peruseevery thing that we lay before them, from time totime) are already familiar with them. They arenow collected together in one volume, printed inexcellent style on fine paper, and accompanied bycertain manufactured 'Notices of an IndependentPress,' a Latin 'Proemium,' 'Note to Title Page,' alearned 'Introduction,' (including a short Dissertationon the Yankee dialect,) and Editorial Notes appendedto the various pieces, by way of elucidation,explanation, and edification; concluding with aGlossary, by which every peculiar Yankee phraseused by the inimitable Yankee author is correctlytranslated, and also a comprehensive Index. Hosea Biglow's first effusion appeared in theCourier in June, 1846. Happening to be in Bostonat that time, when such patriotic (!) efforts weremaking by Gov. Briggs to raise volunteers for theMexican war, he chanced to 'see a cruetin Sarjanta strutting round as popler as a hen with I chicking,with 2 fellers a drummin and fifin after himlike all uater.' Hosy was too shrewd to be caughtin this way; he 'com home considerable riled'at what he had seen, and during the night madehimself immortal by his first effort in rhyme. Hetells the recruiting officer— '"Taint your eppyletts an 'feathersMake the thing a grain more right;'Taint afollerin' your bell-wethersWill excuse ye in His sight.Ef you take a sword an drop it,An go stick a feller then,Gus'mentaint to answer for it—GOD'LL SEND THE BILL TO YOU.'       Gus'mentaint to answer for it—  OD'LL SEND THE BILL TO YOU. Good logic and sound morality, this! All theshow and tinsel of war, though intended to coverits atrocities, will prove unavailing in the day ofjudgment; and, as truly as the night follows theday, every one who has countenanced the war,from James K. Polk down to George N. Briggs,(and who is beneath the latter in point of criminality?)every recruiting officer, every volunteer,will have the bill sent to him, as though he alone haddeclared and carried on the war. Men by to deludethemselves into the belief, that, because theGovernment has made its requisitions upon them,they may commit every conceivable crime, withoutincurring any guilt. But to all such, (to borrowthe quaint language of this Yankee bard,) it maybe soberly said, 'that they've got to git up airly, efthey want to take in God.' Hear him again:— the bill sent to him 'Aint it cute to see a YankeeTake scch everlasting' pains,All to git the Devil's thankee,Helpin' on em weld their chains?Wy, it's jest ex clear ex figgers,Clear ez one an one make two—Chaps that make black slaves o' niggers,Want to make white slaves o' you.'        Want to make white slaves o' you. Certainly—and they succeed in doing so, to amost lamentable extent. In the presence of theSlave Power, there is no Northern manhood, novirtue, no independence: all is servility, of themost despicable stamp. There is not one of theirown institutions which the people of New England,even at this late hour in the anti-slavery struggle,guard with more vigilance from harm, or sustainwith more activity, than they do the 'institution' ofslavery at the South. A most melancholy andmost extraordinary lact! And now, well may it beasked— 'Them that rule us, them slave-traders,Haint they cut a thunderin' swarth,(Helped by Yankee renegaders,)Thru' the vartu o' the North!We begin to think it's naterTo take sarse, an' not be riled:—Who'd expect to see a laterAll on eend at be n' biled?'        'Haint they sold your colored seamen?Haint they made our env'ya wiz?Wut'll make ye act like freemen?Wut'll git your dander riz?Come, I'll fell ye wut I'm thinkin'Is our dooly in this fix—They'd ha' dufie't ex quick ex winkin'In the dayso' seventy-six.'   Wut'll  Wut'll     'Efl'd my way, I hed ratherWe should go to work an' part—They take one way, we take t'other—Guess it wouldn't break my heart!Man hed ough' to put asunderThem that God has noways jined;An'I should n't gretly wonderEf there's thousands o' my mind. my      Them that God has noways jined;   In the nature of the case, nothing can preventthe extension of slavery—the purchase, seizure orconquest of new territory, according to the necessitiesof the South, for its propagation and preservation—the subjugation of the North to its tyrannicalpurposes—and the common degradation of thecountry—except the DISSOLUTION OF THEUNION, which is demanded by every considerationof justice and purity, and especially by thesethree grand reasons:—first, because the slaveholdingcompromises in the Constitution give to theslave system, for its preservation, all the resourcesof the Union, secondly, because without such resources,the slaves could not be kept one hour intheir chains, and now they are held with perfectsecurity; because, by an eternal law, freedom andslavery, instead of mingling harmoniously together,are hostile elements beyond the possibility ofreconciliation. Man ought to put asunder whatGod has never joined, says our rustic bard; andthis is equal in solemnity and authority to thatother declaration—'What God hath joined together,let not man put asunder.' It is neither in thewisdom nor the power of God to join the hands orthe hearts of freemen and tyrants together. TheAmerican Union, therefore, is of Satanic origin,and under Satanic control—being composed oftwo parties, the one party wielding the slave-driver'slash, and the other crouching under it in acraven and ignominious manner. Thank God,the bonds of that Union are weakening hourly, andits doom is certain. In its utter overthrow, theoppressed will have as much reason to shout forjoy as did the Israelites at the disappearance ofPharaoh and his charities in the Red Son. The war upon Mexico is very truthfully described,though in homely phrase, as by one of thevolunteers, as follows—'Caleb' being the odorousand odious Gen. Cushing:— .                A O' swaller:'It can  any  theo can,An' bring 'em like the polices,Or more like the , who (wish is uttunger)Puts her family late her peach wen there's danger.'             The defence set up by these Jesus—faced traitorsis stated with  effort:—  Warn't we gittin 'an prime with our hot an' coldbtewin,Acondemnin' the war wilst we kep' it a goin'?Wal, aposin' we bed to gulp down our perfections,We were ready to come out next mornin' with freshonce;Besides, ef we did, 'twas our business alone,For couldn't we do wut we would with our own?An' of a man can, wen pervisions hev riz so,Eat up his own words, it's a mercy it is so.'          The piece entitled, 'Remarks of Increase D. O'Phace,[Doughface,] Enquire, at an extrumparycauses in State-street, reported by Mr. H. Biglow,'on the refusal of John G. Palfrey to vote for thatlickspittle of Slavery, Robert C. Winthrop, is satirically keen as a Damascus blade. The furiousorator, after heaping terrible anathemas upon Mr.P's head, makes the following patriotic apologyfor his warmth:— 'Forgive me, my friends, ef I seem to be bet,But a crisis like this must with vigor be met;Wen an Arnold the star-spangled banner bestains,Holl Fourth o' Julys seem to bile in my veins.'    This is so American, and especially so Whiggish,at the present time! The Arnold of theRevolution has become infamous for having betrayedthe cause of liberty. Nowadays, he is consideredas bad as Arnold, who proves himself untrueto Slavery! But the orator grows catholicand discriminating:— 'I'm willin' a man should go tollable strongAgain wrong in the abstract:—for thet kind o' wrongIs ollers unpop'lar, an' never gits pitied,BECAUSE IT'S A CRIME NO ONE NEVER COMMITTEE;But he mustn't be hard on particular sins,Coz then he'll be kickin' the people's own shine.'  for thet kind o' wrongIs ollers unpop'lar, an' never gits pitied   ECAUSE IT'S A CRIME NO ONE NEVER COMMITTEE  on particular sins  There is no caricature about this. It is an exactdescription of the moral training of the Americanpeople, under the guidance of their theologicalteachers. 'Wrong in the abstract never getspitied'—no indeed! Why? Because it is a crimewithout a criminal, and therefore one never perpetrated.But, O mad reformer, take care how youmeddle with 'partickler sins!' We have marked many other passages in thisracy volume for quotation, but these must suffice.It combines wit, satire, drollery, pathos, with anelevated moral sentiment throughout, such as thetimes strongly need; and we cannot doubt willfind a host of readers, as we trust it will of purchasersalso. It is hardly necessary to add, that the real authorof it is James Russell Lowell, one of the first poetsof the age.

 The Letters of Henry C. Wright, on the inspirationof the Bible, are exciting considerable discussion,and will undoubtedly awaken inquiry onthis interesting subject. On the last page is acommunication from our worthy friend HenryGrew, of Philadelphia, dissenting from theviews of Mr. Wright, written in his usual excellentspirit. As it is addressed to Mr. W., we shall notattempt to show what we think is illogical and defectivein it. Our readers, having both sides of thequestion before them, will be able to form theirown conclusions. In another column, an esteemed correspondentsuggests the expediency of having a BIBLE CONVENTIONcalled, for the purpose of eliciting furtherdiscussion and research. We should be pleasedto attend such a Convention, and trust it will beheld at a suitable time. 'W.M.F.' refers to theAnti-Sabbath Convention, and thinks it bore thewrong name. We think otherwise. The namewas chosen deliberately and understandingly bythose who called it, because the term 'Sabbath' isindicative of a belief that one day in the week ismore holy than another—which is THE 'superstition'to be done away. With Sunday, or the firstday of the week, we have no controversy. Wesimply deny that there is a Sabbath to be religiouslyobserved, in distinction from other days—and sodid the Convention. We go for calling things bytheir right names. IBLE ONVENTION Sabbath

 REV.EDWARD MORRIS. We think our intelligentreaders would hardly excuse us, if we should occupymuch of our time or space in noticing theridiculous letter of this 'clergyman on Cape Cod,'printed on our last page. It is enough to say, thathe has misrepresented the language of Mr. Pillsbury,(as the latter has already declared in our columns,)and that he is attacking a man of straw ofhis own manufacture, in order to show how courageoushe is in attacking it. His insinuations as tothe American Anti-Slavery Society and its agentsare creditable to his clerical malevolence. He whoinsists that opposition to existing church organizationsis a proof of hostility to true religion maycall himself a Protestant, but his proper place is inthe Romish church. EV. DWARD ORRIS. 

 Better our single and alone—By Truth and Right made strong—Than a faithless band of a thousand men,Contending for the Wrong.    Better a little village, whereTen righteous poor are found,Than mighty Sodom's, rich with gold,By Sin and Falsehood bound.    Better a little State, whose sonsWith tyrants will not band,Whose toil-worn bands are clean from blood,Than a bread and conquering land.    Better a Church of two or three,'Gathered in Jesus' name.In whom the fire of love to manBurns with a deathless flame;—Who, like the good Samaritan,'Ne'er pass the sufferer by,Nor leave those 'fallen among thieves,'Amid their woes to die;—        Who call the scorned and trampled slave,A MAN, a BROTAHER man;And speak for Justice and for Right,In spite of human ban;—    Better a Church of two or three,Thus to Christ' spirit true,Than a multitude who call him 'Lord'Who yet God's will ne'er do.    Then, brother! fear thou not to stand,All single and alone,For the cause of Truth and RighteousnessTo wealth and fame unknown.    For angels, by the world unseen,Shall come to strengthen thee;And the Spirit of Almighty TruthThy Comforter shall be.    Better, then, single and alone,By truth and right made strong,Than with a flattering world to stand,Contending for the Wrong.

 See how giant wrongs are tottering,Feudal forms begin to shake,Barb'rous customs, near to fallingMake a barbarian hearts to quakeLet reformers meet together—Let the strong in faith unite,Hand in hand, and, onward pressing,Labor earnest for the right.        Partisans of scheme and charter,Aid the struggle where you can;Throw aside all party feeling,Be decided to a man.Onward push the car of progress,Be not barriers in its way;Men of truth, sleep on no longer,Watch and labor night and day.        Working men, for right contending.There's a rainbow in the sky;Hope beams through the poor man's dwelling,And the day of victory 'a nigh.Band together for the action,Count two cost, and open the groundWork in earnest, hope with reason,Aid your fetters are unbound.         Statesmen laugh to see your quarrels—Whilst you have they sit at rest;As their portals hourly strengthen,Daily you are more oppressed.Up and conquer, be united!For, divided, you must fall;Quarrel ever, and be bondmen,Or unite, and conquer all!        

 A Convention, called by the authority of the MassachusettsAnti-Slavery Society, assembled in BrinleyHall, Worcester, on Saturday evening, Nov. 25.The meeting was called to order by Samuel May,Jr., General Agent of the Mass. A.S. Society. On motion of Effingham L Capron, Oliver Johnson,of Hopedale, was appointed President. Dr.Harris, of Worcester, was appointed Secretary. The following persons were appointed a BusinessCommittee by the President, in accordance with avote of the Convention, viz: Samuel May, Jr.Emma Wymon, J.M. Fisk, A.K. Foster, J. Spooner. The Convention was addressed in an able andearnest manner, by Parker Pillsbury, Stephen S.Foster and Samuel May, Jr. after which, it adjournedto meet again on Sunday morning. Sunday, Nov. 26. Meeting called to order by the President, OliverJohnson. at 11, A.M. Samuel May, Jr. read portions of Scripture, andoffered prayer. On motion of Samuel May, J.M. Fisk was appointedSecretary, in place of Dr. Harris, who wasabsent. Several resolutions were read by the chairman ofthe business committee, and accepted by the convention—as follows: 1. Resolved, That on this day, which the Son ofGod declared 'WAS MADE FOR MAN,' but which hasso long been prostituted by an anti-Christian Ministryand Church to the upbuilding of a pro-slavery religion,and the hollow formalities of a false and superstitiousworship, it is peculiarly fitting that thelovers of God and man should assemble together tobear their united testimony against American Slavery,its abettors and upholders, and to devise waysand means for breaking the claims of their brethrenin bonds. 2. Resolved, That the American people, in elevatingto the highest office in their gift, a man-stealerand a warrior—a holder of slaves, and a professionalbutcher of men—have demonstrated before the worldthe utter hypocrisy of all their professions of Republicanismand Christianity; and that Massachusetts,by her participation in this God-defying act, has proclaimedherself the friend of tyranny and oppression,and the supporter of infidelity and Atheism. 3. Resolved, That the secession from the old politicalparties of a large body of voters, and the formationof the Free Soil party, so called, for theavowed purpose of preventing the farther extensionof Slavery under the Government of the UnitedStates, is a cheering sign of the times, and encouragesthe hope that the day of Northern subserviency toSouthern dictation is passing away; and that, encouragedby this evidence that their labors have notbeen wholly fruitless, Abolitionists should continueto bear their testimony against slavery in all itsforms and phases, to expose the guilt of all who supportit or connive at its abominations, and especiallyto demonstrate the great truth, that the union ofthese States, under the present Constitution, andsanctioned by the popular religion, in a covenantwith oppression and an agreement with tyrants, toaid them in the hellish design of enslaving thosewhen God created to be free. 4. Resolved, That the Truth of God is mightierthan all human combinations, is dependent upon nohuman skill, does not change with the expedienciesand policies of human wisdom; but is an ever-livingand life-giving principle, and sure to triumphover all oppression, violence and wrong. 5. Resolved, That we put our trust in that Omnipotentpower, in preference to relying upon thepower of numbers, or upon the craftiness of the wiseof this world; and will, therefore, faithfully maintainand proclaim that truth, whoever is justified orwhoever is condemned by it, knowing that by itsmight alone will the strongholds of Slavery, andall other sin, be shaken and pulled down. 6. Resolved, That no ecclesiastical body withrenders deference to the U.S. Constitution, and nopolitical party which acts under it, can be true to theLaw of God; and no man, or body of men, whichdisregards or contemns that Law, can give any effectualhelp to the anti-slavery cause. Remarks were made by the President, touchingthe order of discussion, and the first resolution wasconsidered the subject of remark. Samuel May addressed the meeting, confining hisremarks to the first resolution. Lucy Stone followed upon the same subject. Abby K. Foster continued the subject.

 All honor to the toiling hand,Or in the field or mine;Or by the hissing stream machine,Or on the heaving brine.Whatever loom, or bark, or plough,Hath wrought to bless our land;Or wrought around, above, below,We owe the toiling hand.        In battles with the elements,It breaks the stubborn sward;It rings the forge,—the shuttle throws,—And shapes the social board.It conquers clime,—it stems the wave,—And bears from every strandThe sweetest, best of all we have,Gifts of the toiling hand.        

 The undersigned, a Committee appointed at ameeting held in Faneuil Hall in the month of Maylast, to take measures for the defence of Daniel Drayton,now confined in prison in the District of Columbia,on the charge of stealing slaves, beg leaveto make the following statement:— There was, and we suppose still is, in the Districtof Columbia, if not already sold off to the South,a numerous family of colored persons by the nameof Bell. Moses Bell, the father of this family, obtainedhis freedom by a decision of the SupremeCourt of the United States, on the ground that hehad been brought into the District contrary to law.Bell's wife and children claimed their freedom, also,under the will of her former owner. A suit wasbrought to enforce this claim, which failed, as weare informed, account of some informality or otherdetect in the will. Expecting that his wife and childrenwould be speedily sold off to the South, Bell wentto Philadelphia to solicit funds for their redemption.A large sum would be required for that purpose. Thesepersons seemed equitably entitled to freedom, and theidea was started of sending a vessel to Washington tobring them away. Without any privily on the partof Bell, the case of his family was mentioned to captainDrayton, and believing the Bells to be free inequity if not in law, Drayton volunteered, on thepayment of the necessary expenses, to procure a vessel,and to go with it to Washington to bring theBells away. Information of what was intended was communicatedto a person at Washington, in order to givenotice to the parties interested, and being aware ofthe Edmonson girls,—those girls lately brought tothe public notice, and redeemed from slavery andthreatened prostitution by the liberality of some personsin New York,—he thought it would be a goodopportunity for them to escape also. He communicatedthe opportunity to them and to several others,they communicated it to their friends; and whencaptain Drayton came to sail, instead of having sevenpassengers, as he had expected, he had ten times thatnumber. Drayton was pursued overtaken, and broughtback to Washington. He had been guilty, if of anyoffence, of the simple offence of transporting theslaves out of the District; but not content withfinding seventy-four indictments against him on thatground, the grand jury of the District, under adviceof the District Attorney, found forty-one additionalindictments for stealing slaves from as many differentowners. stealing slaves The trails of two of these indictments consumedupwards of a fortnight; and another fortnight wastaken up with the trial of other cases connectedwith the matter. Contrary to an express decisionlately made in Alabama, and other cases leaning thesame way in other courts of the slaveholding states,and without the shadow of any authority to supporthim, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court,Thomas H. Crawford, late of Pennsylvania, instructedthe jury—That to constitute stealing, there neednot be any design to convert the article taken to thetaker's use; that any incidental gain to any bodywas enough; that to help slaves to escape from theirmasters was stealing, if the person so helping, enticedor induced the slaves to go; and that in thepresent case, the freedom to be obtained by theslaves was a sufficient technical cause lacri! Buteven under this most extraordinary ruling, by whichthe best settled principles of the law of larceny weredisregarded and set aside, there was no case madeout against the prisoner. There was not the slightestevidence that Drayton had enticed or seducedthe slaves, or any slave, to run away. In fact, hehad never seen one of the company till he foundthem on board his vessel. Yet two juries, under thepressure of the outside mob, and the mobocratic exhortationsof the prosecuting officer, after being outeach time some twenty-four hours, brought in verdictsof guilty, on which the judge sentenced Drayton totwenty years imprisonment. Sayers, the master ofthe vessel, charged also with stealing, was triedon two indictments, on the very same evidence,and acquitted, when the other thirty nine indictmentsagainst him were abandoned. cause lacri! Drayton's case is still open to review by thesuperior courts. The honor of the nation demandsthat such perversion of all law should be set aside.The funds hitherto contributed for the purposes ofthis case and others connected with it, amountingto $994,75 in all, have been exhausted. As muchmore is needed to carry the matter to a successfulconclusion; and for that sum, the committee confidentlyappeal to their humane and law-respectingfellow-citizens. The money must be had at once;and all persons disposed to contribute towards sayingthe law from being wickedly perverted, in a court ofthe United States, in the city of Washington, forthe benefit of slavery, are requested to forward theircontributions to JOSHUA P.

 They say that 'Tis sweet for our country to die'—That Fame is a mourner where patriots lie—That glory shall ever our praises prolong,Though dying for country, we die in the Wrong;But I envy not him, on whose laurel-decked bier,The phantom of Glory has wasted a tear,For rather than triumph when Wrong heads the flightI would die as a man in the cause of the Right!I fear not to die—yet should this be my lot,To fall on the field where the strife rages hot.Or writhe out in anguish my last, dying day,'Neath the wounds I have borne in the terrible fray,Then Freedom shall claim me—her martyr I'll fall.Nor die while attempting my brother to thrall.Then Liberty's blossoms shall spring o'er my grave,And my coach be bedewed with the tears of theSlave!

 TO HENRY C. WRIGHT. ENRY RIGHT. DEAR FRIEND—Come and let us reason togetherThe question for consideration is not whether thewriters either of the Older New Testament were some things mistaken; (for this they might indeedbe, when not under the influences of an infalli inspiration;)but the question in, whether they weremistaken in respect to those things which they assureus they received from God as his truth and law You suppose that the record, (Joshua, 7th chap.)that God commanded that Achan and all he hadshould be destroyed, is false; and purity of reasoning,the record that God commanded More todestroy the Canaanites, and subsequent similarcommands, on particular occasions, to go up to waragainst their enemies, are all false. It was all amistake. The Almighty never commanded thesethings. EAR RIEND  some things   is false; destroy Now, my dear Sir, if the writers of the Old Testamentwere mistaken in respect to their testimonyon this point, we can have no confidence in respectto their inspiration on other points. Indeed, youwill concede that your principle requires you to placein the same category, all the Mosaic precepts whichrequired the putting to death for various crimes.You may say that you do not question the divineinspiration of that part of their testimony whilecommends itself to your reason. This, however, isno proof of their infallible inspiration; for althoughtestimony being subversive of right reason is evidenceagainst such inspiration, its accordance withreason is not conclusive evidence is its favor. Youwould not allow to modern fanatics their claim toinfallible inspiration, because they may prophesysome things which are no violation of your reason I would humbly entreat you to consider whetheryour principle does not subvert the divine Inspirationof the New Testament also. Jesus Christ condemnedthe Jews for not believing Moses. 'Had ye belovedMoses, ye would have believed me; for hewrote of me.' John v. 46. Did the Son of Godcondemn them for not believing a man who representedGod as being unjust and changeable,' asyou suppose many of the Mosaic precepts do? Doyou say that the Savior condemned them for not believingwhat Moses wrote of him? What ground,I ask, had they to place confidence in the testimonyof More concerning the advent of the true Prophetwhile his testimony on other points was (as you suppose)totally incompatible with the attributes of JehovahThis glorious fact, though not contrary to reasonwas not accessible to It, without revelation. Itwould seem most reasonable to me, to rank the JewishLawgiver with impostors, on your principle; forit is difficult to conceive that he could be, with hissuperior abilities, mistaken with respect to all thosecommands being given him by God, which pertainto your objectionable category. But admitting thatha was only mistaken in giving commands whichrepresent the Infinitely Holy One as 'unjust andchangeable,' still I ask, does not the condemnationwhich the New Testament passes on those who wouldnot confide in the testimony of such a fanatic, andthe high commendation therein given him as onewho was faithful in all his house,' go far towardsinvalidating the claim of the divine authority of theRegister of all our hope of immortality? Surelywe ought seriously to pause, before we adopt a principleinvolving consequences of such magnitude what Moses wrote of him? mistaken faithful I admit that if you prove the Mosaic precepts to be'unjust, you prove also that they are no revelationfrom God. Divine revelation, right reason, and moralprinciple, are perfectly harmonious. unjust Permit me now to present to your intelligent mindsome objections to your resolutions offered at theRichfield Convention. If I prove your foundationunsound, your superstructure falls. The affirmation in your first resolution, that 'Godis unchangeable,' needs qualification. He is unchangeablein his attributes, but not in the modesof their development. Immutable righteousness isthe basis of all divine law, but' there is made of necessitya chagnes of the law.' Heb vii. 12. Lawsadapted to one dispensation, are not adapted to anotherSuch uniformity would be incompatible withthe grand principle of progress. The Christian dispensation'exceeds in glory' the Jewish. God doesnot now command his children to execute his holyvengeance upon his enemies, not because such an actwould be 'unjust,' but because it is not as consistentunder the present dispensation, as under 'the ministrationof condemnation.' in his attributes chagnes not because such an actwould be 'unjust I find what appears to me the source of error, inyour second resolution. It is not true, I conceivethat (all) the relations of man to man, and the obligationsgrowing out of these relations, are unchangeable.'Consequently, that it is not true,that 'whatever is now opposed to those relationsand duties, ever was and ever must be opposed tothem.' This principle appears to me to be contraryto reason and fact. Why should the relations andobligations of a progressive intelligent being be everunchangeable?' Why should not such a beingemerge from old relations, and enter intohigher, involving higher 'obligations'? What are the facts inthis case?.'The relation of human brotherhood, andthe obligation of mutual love, which includes righteousness'are indeed unchangeable. But is the relationshipof parent and child, and the mutual obligationsof obedience, submission, instruction, government,and support, the same when the child is twenty-fiveyears of age, as when he was five or ten?.'Is the relation of master and servant, and Use obligations thereof, never varied by circumstances Maynot the righteous divine law, which is the basis of allhuman obligation, so regulate the duties of humanrelationships, that what, under one divine dispensationis opposed' to these 'duties,' may not be opposedto those duties under another? It is importantto consider that the duties of a father to a child donot grew out of the natural relationship merely, butout of that relationship, and special laws of God pertaining.to that relationship. These laws, though theyan never violate righteousness, may vary underdifferent dispensations:—e.g. Under the Christiandispensation, it is not the duty of a father to a son to death for Idolatry. Why not?' is itbecause the act of stoning a man to death for this sinin itself as unrighteous, that God cannot justlyrequire the father to do it, as Moses affirms he did?How then shall God judge the world? If 'the wars(i e. desert) of sin is death,' why may not thedefended Sovereign, the infinite Source of all beingad of all good, make the father the executioner ofis righteous retributive justice? So, if the Canaanitesmerited death' at the hand of God, for their innumerabletransgressions, (which I do not understandyou to deny.) how was he any more unjust toinflict it by the hands of the laccolites than by thecotilence or the earthquake? now merely special laws of God pertaining.to that relationship.   If, then, your second relations is perfectly , infer too much from the premises. If a Jew hadkilled his son for rebellion or idolatry, without a dinecommand, he would have acted contrary to theobligations of his paternal relationship; but the commandof God created a new obligation, not foundedin the natural relationship but on the divine requisitionSuch requisition is as violation of. the natureand obligations of the relationship, because therelation does not involve the principle, that it woulda wrong for the father inflict a punishment the deserves it the hand of God, if God requiresbe father to do so although it dies  theprinciple, that he has no right to do so without requirement.      on the third and fourth relations, I hog leave to of the  and the of the law of those  there divine  which your  and without , under two or three wit of how  punishment, suppose ye, shall to be enough orthy, under foot the  of  Depart, cursed, into  perposed for thedevil and  angles. D the Author ofChristianity himself tread to wise- of the firenessand wreth of Almighty God? By what logalprocess, I ask can you prove, that it is more opposedto the nature of God' to require men to stonethe transgressors of his law to death, than it is torequire his angles to cast them alive into the lake offire? Rev six 20.                             firenessand wreth  It is evident that you object, not only to particulardeception acts, accompanying the acts of putting.person's to death by divines authority,(as stained bythe writers of the Bible,) but to the act itself of putting.to death by human instrumentality. You representthe act of Joel killing Sierra, as sintel actat assassination.' The divine command to the Israelites,to stay the Canaanites,  did not implydivine direction, or authority, to use all the deceptivearts, or all the measures, which they adopted forthe fulfillment of that command. It is not necessary,therefore, for us to  all at hat Joel, or Ebud,or others did, with the divine  but onlywhat is claimed to have been  authorityof God. In your quotations from the Old Testament,especially in your letter of) ct 20th, theseare many objectionable matters, which God nevercommanded. We speak of the Bible as the Word ofthe Lord, but it contain the words of wicked men,and the words of the devil. particulardeception acts     I ask for your proof, that it was any more unjustor inconsistent with the nature of God, for him tosmile Sis era with the nail of Joel, or Egben withthe dagger of Ehud, than it was for him to smiteHerod with worms, when all were sinners deservingeverlasting death? How do you prove that it wasmore unjust to slay the Midianites with the sword ofIsrael, than it would have been to have slain themwith the pestilence It may be raid, that the promiscuousperishing of many women and children,by disease or earthquake, in the consequence of naturallaws. I reply, that what God does by naturallaws, be does himself; and that it is no more just to.perpetrate moral wrong, by the laws of nature, thanby any other means. Although under the Christian dispensation, theretaliatory precepts of the Jewish code are abrogated,and God gives no command to one nation to destroyanother, it is matter of fast that be still uses humaninstrumentality in accomplishing his righteous judgmentsagainst the workers of iniquity. The Romanarmy was as much the rod of the Lord's angeragainst Jerusalem, as the Assyrian was under theprevious dispensation. It is under the present blesseddispensation of 'grace and truth,' that the prophetic.word, concerning the pouring out of the vialsof divine wrath, and the dashing to pieces the nationsof the earth, is to be fulfilled, in part at least,by human instrumentality. command If the judgments and ways of an infinite being areunsearchable, and past finding out, by finite minds,(which reason itself must admit,) it is certainly unreasonableto impeach those judgments and ways,because they are, in some respects, inscrutable. infinite finite It appear to me that your theory (which I respectfullyand earnestly entreat you to review.) castsa dark pall over the entire Charter of our eternalhope. If `holy men of old speak (not) as they weremoved by the Holy Ghost,' in reaped to the commandsto which you object, we have no assurancethat they did so on any other occasion. And as JesusChrist and his apostles recognize the commandsto which you object, as the inspiration of the EternalSpirit, by sanctioning without such exception, thegeneral testimony of the prophets; it follows, if youare correct, that they also were mistaken, and, consequently,their own testimony is not reliable. Wecan, therefore, have no knowledge of the divine forgivenessof sin, or of a future state, beyond whatour own reason can furnish. If the foundationsare removed, what can the righteous do?' I have only to add my grateful acknowledgmentsto our mutual friend, for his kind liberality in givingmy articles a place in his columns. Truly, yours, HENRY GREW. 

 S OUTHBORO', NOV. 14, 1848. OV. To HENRY C. WRIGHT: ENRY RIGHT Sir—I felt much interested in your remarks in theLiberator of the 10th inst., in which you set forththe misdeeds, said to be done and approved of. byGod. You inform us the minister called them mysteries,which required the exercise of faith to reconcile.with his divine goodness, mercy, and unchangeableness;which Mystery and Faith you assert, inthe commencement of the affair, was a laughablematter, and therefore not satisfactory. Now I feelas much disposed to exhibit your portion as equallyridiculous and laughable as the former position, andrequires both the same amount of Mystery and Faithto support and believe it; and that is, there in sucha being as God, the great Maker and Creator of allworlds, angels', spirits, minds, thoughts, wills andbodies of men, who is all Love and Justice, and foreverunchangeable; and having so made man, Iwould enquire of you by what possible means anyman can acquire ability to be certain that he will notviolate the laws of Love and Justice, unless God voluntarilybestows it upon him; and that all violationsof Love add Justice (if so bestowed) arise from hispartiality in the bestowment, and thus render mana mere passive being, not responsible far either goodor evil?

 MR.. EDITOR: R.. DITOR DEAR SIR—I thank you for your courtesy in sopromptly publishing say letter, after year return tothe city. I began to think that it was held over,that Mr. Pillsbury, or some one else, might publishan explanation which should appear simultaneouslywith it; bat I little expected to be honored by so bragan editorial from yourself. Whilst I am gratefulfor your courtesy, I am not thankful for the conterminousepithets and securing remarks you applyto me; they aided nothing in convincing me thatI am wrong, or that you, Mr. Pillsbury, &c. areright. But I opine they were not interested for this,but merely to please the vitiated taste of the classof readers you have to write for. Only that I shouldde violence to the best of my inclinations, and gocontrary to the teachings of Jesus, I could render'railing for railing' and restart this infidel slang' hireling priesthood,'&c. and write afew soleman on the subject besotted, hirelingeditors, hireling, lecturers, and a hireling poses; butI forbear. EAR IR  Year long editorial has convinced me thatMr. P, is  or immculate or that yourSociety is  worthy of public support whilst it  such continents as adveted by its .

But you any positively,'therulers, scribes and chief pri, frown upon him withindignation, and  him with contempt'.'Without stopping to question the necessary' of thisstatement, but admitting its correctness where isthe sacrifice?

If you cannot one the possibility ofsuch a case, you must be the subject of an obtusenessof vision, which I never supposed you possessedof. I can very distinctly perceive how a mancan become such an apostate, as to be an enemyto all true religion, and, at the same time, have somuch benevolence for a portion of the oppressedhuman family, as to be an enemy to a pro-slaveryreligion, which is a false, though assuming to be thetrue religion. An enemy to it, not because it 'stealsthe livery of heaven to serve the devil in,' but becauseit helps to crush down more deeply the oppressedI think I shall always see thus distinctly,unless I should because so blinded by Come-out-that the 'light within me should' become darkness,'which at present there is no danger of. gracious editorial  I hope for his own sake, that Mr. P. is not such anenemy as this, and that he will frankly state his positionI expect he will take the cue he is furnishedwith from head quarters, (pardon me, if I am toosuspicious in supposing this to be the design of youreditorial,) and say that, when at North Dennis, heonly expressed opposition to all church organizations,and all ministers, as such. But church organizationswas not the question. The religion ofthe country,' as, my former letter stated, was thequestion at issued. I merely quoted the very closingwords of what transpired, for the sake of brevity. head quarters very closingwords I must now go back a little, and if necessarygo back still further in another communication, andgive such a report of Miss Stone's lecture as shallbear the most stringent criticism, and put it beyondyour insinuations of inaccuracy. After she haddealt in the most extravagant, sweeping, and unjustdenunciations of all, of every name, every where,excepting one solitary church where Mrs. Fosterhad lectured—inferring that this exception wasthrough her influence-and after I had made the remarkscommunicated in my last, Mr. Maynard roseand took exceptions to her statements, and referredto individual cases, where true religion was exemplifiedand enforced; and in conclusion said—' You arecalled Come-outers. Now it seems there is no differencesbetween us as to what constitutes lift principlesof true religion;' and then referring to the religion,churches and ministers specified by himselfand me, be asked, 'Do you advise the people to renouncesuch religion, come-out of such churches,and desert such clergymen? Mr. P. certainly withouteither 'pruning or polishing,' answered, My adviceto the people is, to scamper away from thewhole of them as last as ever you can.' Now if he says that they meant by their sweepingcharges and denunciations, only to condemn allchurch organizations, and not the true religion containedin any of them, so far it will be satisfactory;but that will be an acknowledgment of yet greaterwrong, viz. that of acting dishnestly. Inasmuchas whilst the reason exhibited, and pressed uponthe people, why they should come out of the churcheswas their pro-slavery character, the hidden andsecret reason was, an hostility to all church organizations.Take for him, if you please, whicheverhorn you choose. acting dishnestly. hidden andsecret You say for him, 'what if he takes the Quakerview? (By the way, I think the Friends are labeledby the comparison.) Well, what if he doestake their views of what you please to term a hirelingpriesthood,' and should take all their argumentsagainst the 'hireling priesthood' of a law establishedchurch, by which they were persecuted in the oldcountry, and twist them to apply to the clergy of thiscountry? He would only be borrowing their oldarguments,—as was done, in my hearing, at yourAnti-Sabbath Convention; but he could never usethem in so good a spirit as they did, unless be alteredconsiderably for the better, in the temper of hismind. If he holds such views, he had a perfect right to doan, but let him given an honest expression to them,and not make the anti-slavery cause the meansthrough which covertly to promulgate them. covertly If, as you seem to intimate, the American Anti-SlaverySociety will approve this course of its lecturers,then I prefer the three following serious chargesagainst it, and would exhort it to do its 'firstworks.' 1st, Fraud. 2d, Dishonestly. 3d, Inconsistency. 1st.

 A congress of Delegates from various parts of the.world, for the promotion of Universal Peace, washeld in Brussels to September last. Elilan Barrett,who was present, has given an interesting accountof it in the Christian Cities. Here is an extract; M. Roussell, the elegant and accomplished advocatewhose very voices was the language of peace—whose every gesture and word seemed to take itsgrace from the spirit of good will to man—nextmounted the tribune, and was received with accelaof welcome. When silence was restored,he loaned over the tribune, and seeming to canvassevery face before him for an expression of assent,ha said, in its sweetest tone: 'I am going to askyou to proclaim, by unanimous rote, that the momentfor a universal disarmament has come.' Theshale assembly was struck with the earnest simplicityWith which he put this important proposition'In this listening audience,' he continued,'there are a great number of persons who must beastonished at these absolute words. What! saythey, disarm all at once! destroy the security whichwe enjoy! to cause our defenses to disappear inthe face of foreign nations? Gentlemen, let us beginby examining the foundation upon which armiesrest—the principle upon which that habit isbased which impels men to kill their fellow-beings,who would be little disposed to do it unless constrainedby obligation. It is war that engendersarmies. You have just condemned war; you mustalso condemn armies. But, says one, it is not warthat we wish from enemies, it is an armed pence.Armed pencez two words which groan at beingcoupled together. It is like saying a living corpse!Davie, I believe has said 'Sievis Pacem, Para bellum'if you wish for peace, prepare for war. Butwould it not have been much better, had he said,'if you wish for peace, prepare for peace.' Youdesire a certain result, and you prepare for a contraryone! This is no armed pence! an enormouscontradiction, which has only survived because ithad a Latin proverb to loan upon.' After proceedingin this strain for bonus time, he concluded byanything: 'Disarmament a necessity of civilizationbecause peace is a necessity of civilization. Perhapswe may not see-it;  without taking theairs of a prophet, our children will we it. Menwill one day embrace each other, and cease to killtheir kind.'  Armed pencez living corpse! 'Sievis Pacem, Para bellum' armed pence!  Henry Vincent followed; and no one could do itmore in harmony with Russell. Each was themost eloquent of his countrymen present. Thegenius of each was inspired with good will to man,which shone in their countenances. The Belgihad enjoyed the rich treat of his eloquence, andwelcomed him to the tribune with an English demonstrationof enthusiasm. Nor did he disappointour expectations. He again raised the assembly toa state of delectable exhalation, not so much by thesheer force of brilliant ideas, as by that heart powerwhich he gives to his burning words. Referringto the exceptions which Abbe Louis had takento what he had said in his first speech on the powerof public opinion, he observed,' I maintain whatI have ' it is public opinion that will slay war;not that vicious and vacillating public opinion whichhas been described to us; but the public opinion,impregnated, as it were, with the holy truths ofChristianity, armed with the conquests of science,emanating from the glorious perfection mint of thehuman understanding, and based upon eternal justice.'He concluded his speech with these words:'Great and glorious will be the nation which shalltake the initiative in this disarmament. Its nameshall be handed down to posterity an that of the firstpeople which understood the mission of humanity.You, Belgians, will, perhaps, merit this immortalhonor. I should be happy to see your countrytake the lead in this noble course. My country!that name recalls sweet association. The placewhere we first beheld the sun, the school in whichwe received our first instructions the church inwhich we first worshipped the Creator, the givenlanes down which we walked in the early days ofchildhood, are memories which nothing canefface. But however sweet to me these preciousreminiscences, dearly as I love my country, I declareto you I love humanity more.' These wordsany one might write; but no language can conveythe power which Henry Vincent threw into them,and which seemed to hit the whole assembly fromtheir seats. 'Friends and brethren,' be concluded,'from the centre of your beautiful capital shallflow forth among the nations the first streamletsof the fountain of peace and love. Turn your backsthis night and forever upon the military spirit,against the barbarian of brute force, which has sooften been applied as the power by which therights of nations are maintained and wrongs redressed,and turn to that brighter future in whichthe world shall yet see realized all the bright pictureswhich have filled the minds of divine poetsand philosophers of all ages. Welcome here theform of Peace, beautified in its appearance, evenas a tender maiden. Garland it with flowers; itwill march through the world, though a mere striplingstrong in its moral influence; girl round withthe precepts of the Gospel, it shall ever succeed. Itshall attract, by its own inherent refulgence, all thatis beautiful and just in the world, and the day shallcome when the armies shall fly be tire this messengerof Peace; the gun shall be spiked with thepen, and Belgium shall yet proclaim the reign ofliberty, of justice, and of love!'
