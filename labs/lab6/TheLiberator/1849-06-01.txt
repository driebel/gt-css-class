 On Monday evening, we stepped into Park streetmeeting-house, to bear the Anniversary adores beforethis Society, by CHARLES SUMNER. We foundthe specious house filled to overflowing, at an earlyhour, by a throng of eager expectants, whom thereputation of the author for learning, eloquence, andphilanthropy, had drawn together, rather than sayspecial interest in the cause of Peace. After a professionalprayer by one of the clergy, and the reading ofa few extracts from the Annual Report by the Rev.George C. Beckwith, Mr. Sumner commenced hisaddress by eulogizing the object of the Society asone which had been the aspiration of the wise andgood in pat ages; over which, at the advent of Jesus,the angels rejoice I; and which was more comprehensiveand important than that pertaining to thecivilization of the pagan, or the emancipation of theslave. It was PEACE—PEACE. He then proceeded tostate, that the Society was misunderstood and misrepresentedas to its views and aims. It did not denythe right of self-defence; of putting men to deathwhen public safety demanded it; of bloody revolutionto behalf of freedom! On these points, it had noopinions to express; and with them it had no directconcern! For himself, he deeply sympathized withthose who were now struggling in Europe to obtaintheir liberty by force and arms; and this he expressedto a manner that the audience, by their applause,clearly understood as sanctioning, not only the objectof the revolutionists, but their mode of accomplishingit by slaughter and devastation, by civil war. Theone grand object of the Society was to prevent internationalwars by arbitration; it was dumb in regardto all other modes of shedding blood, to all otherwars! And it WM about this, it seems, that the angelssung, eighteen hundred years ago; this was whatthey meant by their annunciation, 'Peace on earth,good will towards men'! This was he scope of thepacific mission of Jesus!—for the orator, in referringto the kingdom of God on earth as not an Utopianidea, and to the advent of the Messiah in connectionwith the establishment of peace, evidently claimedfor the Peace Society, at the start, that it covered thewhole ground of Christianity on this subject. HARLES UMNER. professional We did not wait to hear the remainder of this discourse,(which we doubt not contained many just, eloquentand powerful passages,) having engagementselsewhere to be met that evening. We came awaywith our convictions disposed as to the incompetenceof any society, which is based upon expediency insteadof principle, to effect any radical moral changein the opinions or practices of mankind. 

 ☞ In the late State Emancipation Convention inKentucky—we see it stated— Rev. R.J. Breckinridge signalized himself bythe power and pathos of his appeals. We wish hecould have been reported in full. 'Never,' says oneof the editors of the Louisville Examiner, 'have welistened to addresses of more thrilling eloquence, ofmore transcendent power, than the two pronouncedby Rev. Robert J. Breckinridge. At times, whilehe spoke, the silence of the house was like the stillnessof the grave. At other times, his words rousedand agitated his bearers almost beyond their powerof self-control. Some of the pictures drawn by himin illustration of slavery were appalling. He characterizedit as 'the most atrocious of all human institutions,'as a system 'which denies to a whole classof human beings the sacredness of marriage and ofhome, compelling them to live in a state of concubinage,for, in the eye of the law, no colored slaveman is the husband of any wife in particular, norany slave woman the wife of any husband in particular;no slave man is the father of any childrenin particular, and no slave child is the child of anyparent in particular.' While alluding to the argumentof pro-slavery men, that the people have noright to interfere with the relation between masterand slave, because the master has a vesed right,a right of property in Ins slave, Mr. Breckinridgeasked, with a solemnity of tone and an earnestnessof spirit which thrilled and awed every listener,'Does it ever occur to these gentlemen, that thehighest, the helical of all rights, is a man's right tohimself?'  thehighest, the helical of all rights, is a man's right tohimself?'

 You will have learned by the time this reachesyou, that the French have landed at Civita Vecchia,and they have been repulsed with a loss of 150 killedand about 400 wounded. Thus we have the FrenchRepublicans, or rather the men who are in power inFrance under the denomination of a republic, sendingan army of 10,000 men to prevent the Roman peoplefrom choosing their own government. The best informedhere now believe there will be a sharp andshort struggle, in which the people of the Europeancontinent will have to fight the question with Russiaand its serfs, and their own worn out dynasties, andin which liberty will be the prize, or despotism theresult. There will be much bloodshed, but that ultimategood will flow from this great evil I do not doubt. The Hungarians have been thus far gloriously successful.They have formally thrown off Austria, andset up for themselves, and they will keep the houseof Hapsburg employed. The Germans are well disposedto meet the Russians. The Prussian King hasagain shown his faithlessness, and the consequence ofthe French interference in Italy is again giving powerto the Liberals in France. A call has been made inthe Chamber for the instructions given to the General,and the consequences which have thus far resultedfrom their unjust interference with the Romish people,shows that it is likely to agitate France politically asit has convulsed Rome. It is impossible for theFrench government to justify this intervention. Asit respects the Roman people, they were not invited,and therefore not entitled to interfere. As it regardsthe Pope, if they interposed on his behalf, they werecontradicting that right in the Roman people whichthey had assumed in their own case. The movementin the French Chamber has elicited the instructionsgiven to General Oudinot. Here they are:— General—I have informed you that, by order of thePresident of the Republic, you are called upon to intervenewith the Roman government, which we havenever recognized. Now in the crisis which henceforthis inevitable, the duty of government is to take the necessarymeasures for maintaining the influence of Franceto the Italian peninsula, and to lay down an order ofthings upon a foundation conformable to the interests ofthe population. Though you have not to intervene in thedetive negotiations which are to have this result,you will have to receive from the established authorizesall proposals, and to make with them all the arrangementswhich shall be rendered necessary by circumstances.It is requisite for form's sake, howeverto avoid all that might appear to be a recognition ofthe principle established at Rome. You will find annexed(continues the instruction) the model of yourcorrespondence with he authorities. We believe thatyou will be eagerly received by some as a liberator,by others as a useful mediator against the dangers ofreaction. Your march upon Rome would no doubt the denouement, by giving courage to thehonest portion of the community. Such are the instructionsI give you at this moment. Your judgmentwill supply any thing that may have been omitted.   denouement Are not these instructions nicely mystical! Whatcould the writer mean in telling the General that hewas to 'lay down an order of things upon a foundationconformable to the interests of the population.'and that it was 'requisite to avoid all that might appearto be a recognition of the principle established atRome.' The fact is, that the dishonest writers or concoctorsof those instructions were ashamed to sayopenly that which they intended to do, namely, to assistrestoring the Pope, and to gain for themselvesthe honor of restoring him; for so they have esteemedhis elevation, if they could have secured it. Howcanting old man, who was constantly puttingforth pious aspirations for liberty and the welfare ofthe people, can wish to be put upon a temporal throne,by the force of bayonets and bullets, it is not for onenot versed in the mystery of cant and Jesuitism, tosay. It seems that since he has been made to abscondfrom Home, the Scriptures have been freely and largelydistributed amongst the people This is a blowfrom which priestcraft will not be able to recover, forthe Scriptures of the New Testament will be read, ifhe and his Camarilla of priests should return andpersecute those who possess them. Such persecutionwill only make it the more cherished, and it will becomethe dearer, because it is forbidden. The factthat his excommunication was treated with indifference,shows that the people had fallen away from thepriests, and were prepared to receive the Scriptures,He assured of this, that the light that has risen,though it may be clouded, cannot be extinguished,and that the result will be the increase of knowledge,and that rapidly and extensively.  Yours truly, EDWARD SEARCH. 

 The time has arrived when empty declamation onthe evils of slavery, and angry denunciations ofslaveholders, no longer avail to excite public indignation,and have ceased to be the stalking horsealike of fanatical ambition and mercenary adventure.They never did avail to promote the cause ofemancipation, but rather verified to retard its progress,by precluding the co-operation to that end ofbenevolent slaveholders, without which the objectcannot be attained; unless, indeed, in the progressof time, the proportion of the races shall become reversed,and then only as the result of a servile insurrection,that shall terminate either in the exterminationof the blacks of the subjugation of the whites.The utter fruitlessness of the agitation at the Northas a means of extinguishing slavery, has become apparentto all. And in proportion as this agitationsubsides, we may expect other men, of at least equalbenevolence, and much more practical wisdom, toput their shoulders to the wheel; Southern men aswell as Northern; men who look at the subject inall its bearings. As an earnest of this state ofthings, we have read with much pleasure a series ofessays from the pen of Rev. Dr. Bangs, a leadingclergyman of the Methodist Episcopal Church, inwhich the advantages as well as the justice ofemancipation are demonstrated, and a plan for itsaccomplishment suggested. Although he had reflectedfrom publishing his thoughts respecting it,the evil being so thoroughly interwoven in the socialsystem of many of our States, that there was greathazard lest the effort to remove it should uptear alsothe foundations of the social fabric, confounding thegod and the bad in one common ruin. But nowthat the public mind, no longer agitated with the abolitionexcitement, has become calm enough tohearken to sober counsel, there is less motive fordelay, and less danger in action. As to the evil, of slavery, which indeed are eachas to be perceptible to the most superficial observer,he deems it of less importance to dwell, than on themethods to be adopted and pursued for their removal.By reference to the origin and history of slaveryin the United States, he demonstrate, that thewhole people thereof, as well in the free as in theslave States, are responsible for the evil, resultingfrom its establishment, and bound to co-operate inall prudent and practical measures for extirpating thesource from which they flow. The pecuniary profitsof the slave trade were nearly engrossed by theNorthern Colonists. From them proceeded the shipping,the men, and the capital requisite to conductthe horrid traffic; and we their descendants are nowenjoying the property derived from its prosecution.A very considerable portion of the substance we possesswas received in exchange for the progenitorsof those slaves that now cultivate the Southernplantations. Finding their labor comparatively profitlessat the North, our ancestor, exchanged themfor money, which they could employ profitably inthe various branches of business, but chiefly so inthe African slave trade. At length, the revoltingcruelty and inhumanity with which it was prosecuted,drew public attention to the iniquity of the traffic,and by the consent of nearly the whole civilizedworld, the African slave trade was declared to bepiracy punishable with death. The cessation of supplyenhanced the price of slaves in the markets ofthe South, and produced a gradual tendency in thatdirection, which soon resulted in reducing theirnumbers in the Northern States to a very small fractionof the population. Emancipation at the Northwas thus effected almost without pecuniary sacrifice,–an ample indemnity in money, in nearly all cases, havingbeen received therefor from the South. Therelative position of the North and South, therefore,in respect to slavery, is this: The North, after havingpartaken most largely in the profits of the slavetrade, holds its property free from the incumbranceof slavery, and in a manageable shape, to be employedas capital in such department of human industryas its proprietor may select. The South, onthe other hand, holds its property, in great part, inslaves; its lands have become sterile, and its peopledegenerate, under the curse of slave labor. Itgroans tinder the evils entailed upon it, but hithertohas found no remedy that would not aggravate itsmisery. Then comes the mockery of self-righteousexhortation from the North—'Emulate our virtuousexample, and rid the land of slavery.' 'Willingly,'is the reply, 'if you, from whom we bought ourslaves, will take the purchase off our hands, and relieveus of a bad bargain.' 'Such an act would bea recognition of the right of property in humanbeings,' rejoins the North, 'and that we cannot conscientiouslyassent to.' Although the view of the subject above presentedis not fully developed in the essays of Dr. Bangs, itseems to us to be a fair deduction from his assumedposition. The plan of emancipation proposed byhim is based on the obligation resting upon thewhole people of the United State, to effect it,—notby decrying the evil,—by exposing and condemningit.—but by a sacrifice of time and money, and by aconcentration of national effort, which alone are adequateto the removal of an evil so gigantic as slaveryis acknowledged to be. The application of thiseffort, however, must be directed with the greatestprudence and caution, to prevent the infringementof rights guarantied by the federal compact Thegovernment of the United States can exercise nojurisdiction over slavery as it exists in the States.Legislation on this subject belongs exclusively to theStates. Dr. Bangs proposes that Congress shall offerto the several State, a specific sum per head forevery slave that shall be emancipated,' leaving it tothe State legislatures respectively to adopt theirown measures for effecting the object—for fixingthe time, the age at, and the circumstances underwhich, emancipation shall take place.' The provisionapplicable to their condition should be made forthe nurture of the young and helpless, and for thesupport of the aged and infirm. The amount necessaryto remunerate the slave proprietors, Dr. Bangscomputes to be $400,000,000, estimating the numberof slaves at 4,000,000, (which is at least 1,000,000beyond the fact,) and their average value, of all agesand conditions, at $100 each; and be proposes thatCongress should raise the requisite amount, eitherby the levy of a tax, or by setting apart therefor theavails of the public lands. The constitutionality of this project, Dr. Bangsdeclines arguing; for he aver, that, if the right bewanting, it can be given to Congress in the way theConstitution prescribes by Article V. of that instrument.Hence we infer, that he would not urge itsexercise, save under circumstances of such generalconsent of public sentiment as would authorize amodification, if necessary, of the Federal Constitutionrequisite to that end. After all, the great difficulty in the case impossibility,at least, for the present, of bringing theminds of the people to assent to a project so vast, andapparently so costly. In its material features, theInject is not new, but has often been suggested andpondered by philanthropists. The time may comewhen public sentiment both North and South willsanction it, but at present the case is far otherwise.When the cause of emancipation shall become apervading matter of interest to the people; whenthey come to look upon slavery as a common calamity,to be removed by a joint effort and sacrificethroughout the country, the way will be open for theexecution of any such scheme as that under consideration.Meanwhile, as a step in the progress of themovement towards universal freedom, we regardwith great interest the course of  in Kentucky.Evidently there is a good work going onthere; and if Northern abolitionists can be keptquiet, we anticipate the happiest results. A correspondentof the New York Observer, writing fromFrankfort, after giving an account of the recent Conventionof the friends of gradual emancipation andcolonization in Kentucky, and the noble spiritof humanity and philanthropy there developed,adds—  'This movement is strictly of indigenous assign;it has not been promoted nor hastened, but, on thecontrary, has been retarded, for many long years, byforeign influences. 'And now, if you wish to crush it—if you wish toblast the opening bud before it shall fully bloom andfinally ripen into glorious fruit, gat up another abolitionexcitement at the North; send us abolition documents,or any kind of documents in the remotestmanner touching the subject of slavery; send us secretor open missionaries of emancipation and yourwork is done. But if you wish to aid us in this greatand glorious work, then cultivate and diffuse over thewhole free territory of the Union, the spirit which hasbeen exhibited in the New York Observer for the lasttwenty years, and your aid will be most gratefullyreceived, and he most effective in its influence. Ibeseech the people of the North to forbearance, andnon-interference, and non-agitation, by all the aspirationsthey feel for the universal freedom and elevationof the African race. Nothing can or will preventit, but such agitation and such interference, whichwill be as indignantly mot and spurned by the emancipationparty in Kentucky, as by any portion of itshigh-spirited and self-relying population.'

OSEPH ARKER WORTLEY, near Leeds, May 9th, 1849. ORTLEY MY DEAR FRIEND: Y EAR RIEND I am tend to visit America in the course of five orsix weeks. My objects are,— 1. To see you and other American friends. 2. To gain as much information respecting thecountry, and the working of its laws and institutions,as possible. 3. To gain such information as may enable me tobe of service to intending emigrants. 4. To satisfy myself as to whether it would be addressablefor me to bring my family to America, andsettle in the country myself. 5. To establish an agency in America for some ofmy publications. And lastly, to contribute a little, as opportunitymay offer, towards the cause of American and universalfreedom and reformation. I shall come in one of the steamers, very likely, toBoston; proceed from Boston to New York; fromNew York into Ohio, where I have three brotherssettled. From Ohio I intend to pass on through Indiana,Illinois and Wisconsin. I have a great many personal friends in America. Some thousands who formerly were my readers inEngland, are now in America, and I should like, as Ipass along, to have an opportunity of meeting with asmany of them as possible, and addressing them. Perhapsyou will have no objection to mention my intendedvisit in the 'Liberator.' I believe your paperis read by a number of my friends in America. Theywould make known my intended visit to others, andthus the greater part of my friends would be preparedto receive me. I should feel obliged if you wouldrequest Frederick Douglass to mention my intendedvisit in the 'North Star.' How I shall bear the heat of your July and August,I cannot tell. If you think it would be muchbetter for me to come at some other period, youwould perhaps be so kind as to favor me with a line.But I wish to see your country in its bloom, that Imay be able to form some judgment of its productivepowers. I may be commissioned to purchase land;and I imagine I should be battle able to judge of theworth of land by seeing it in summer, than I shouldby seeing it at my other season.

 The next annual meeting of the American Boardis to be held at Oswego,—the very focus of Abolitionismin New York. At that meeting will be decidedthe question, 'What shall be done with theChoctaw Mission?' This Mission has been greatlyblessed, and its churches comprise over 900 members.A few of these happen to be slaveholders.The missionaries themselves hire slave labor, beingunable to procure any other. These facts, havingbeen presented by one of the Secretaries of theBoard (Mr. Treat) at the last annual meeting inBoston, in that peculiar light which Abolitionistsknow how to cast upon every thing which has referenceto the question of slavery, gave rise to a warmdiscussion, from which it was manifest that therewas a wide difference of opinion among the members,as to the course pursued by the Choctaw missionaries,and also as to the doctrines set forth in Mr.Treat's report The subject was at length postponedto the next annual meeting, which, as wehave said, is to be held at Oswego, early in September.To this meeting, many of the members andfriends of the Board are looking forward with muchanxiety. As a means of avoiding a direct issue on the excitingquestions involved, which have already rent intwain two of the largest religious denominations inthe U. States, the new Congregational paper in thiscity (the Independent) recommends that the Missionbe at once transferred to the Missionary Board of thePresbyterian Church (Old School.) Says that paper— 'There appears to be a complete harmony of views,not only between the Choctaw Nation and the adjoiningslave Slates, but between the Choctaw churchesand the churches of those States, and between themissionaries and the Presbyterian ministry of theSouth-west. How obvious then is the solution of thedifficulty which has arisen in regard to the Choctawmission under the charge of the American Board!Can any reason be suggested why these missionariesshould not look for support to the Southern Presbyterianswith whom they are in sympathy on the greatquestion of the age, and who are their nearest neighbors,rather than to the Congregationalists and Presbyteriansof the North, who are a thousand miles offfrom them, and with whom they cannot sympathize onthat great question? Why should there not be atonce an amicable arrangement between the AmericanBoard and the Assembly's Board of ForeignMissions, by which the Mission shall be transferredfrom the one to the other?' The suggestion, it seems to us, is a good one. Ifcarried into effect, it will permit the mission to goon as it has hitherto been conducted, and produce,we trust, the same blessed fruits, while at the sametime it will enable any whose consciences are troubledby what has been done, to abstain henceforthfrom a repetition of the crime. crime. Unless the above course is adopted, we see noother alternative but either that the Mission must besustained on its present basis by the present Board,(in which case the Abolitionists will make it an occasionof much mischief,) or be 'cut off,' in whichcase it is safe to presume that it will be taken up bya Secession from the present Board and its contributors,and carried on as it has heretofore been. Theexpense is only $5000 to $6000 a year. But such aSecession would on various ground, be much to bedeplored, and we trust there will be wisdom enoughin the Board to forestall and prevent it. While on this subject, we beg to offer a singlesuggestion. Hitherto, the American Board has beena purely missionary body, and has confined its effort,to the spread of the gospel among the heathen,including the North American Indians, sometribe, of whom (and the Choctaw, are one of them)have, chiefly through missionary efforts, become morethoroughly Christianized than the average populationof New England. It has steered clear of the Shibbolethsof sectarianism, and the spasms of altruism.None of our religious benevolent societies seemedto have less real connexion with slavery, or less occasionto be drawn into any controversy concerningit. But the Abolitionists were determined that itshould be dragged in, if it would not come voluntarily.They began by objecting to the receipt ofmoney from slaveholders for the spread of the gospel;and more recently, by the discovery that thirtyeightslaveholding Indiana among the Choctawshave been converted and admitted to the Missionchurches, together with one hundred slaves, has furnishedmaterial for a new onset. But we are makingour story too long. The suggestion which we wishedto offer is this: that as the Board at its meeting inBrooklyn, two or three years ago, adopted resolutionson the subject of slavery which proved to be generallysatisfactory to the friends of missions, it would bea dangerous experiment now to abandon its conservatism,and resolve itself into an Abolition Society.As surely as it takes such a course, it will alienatemany of its best friends and largest contributors. Thepublic have had an opportunity to see the strength ofthe Abolition faction, and in the separate organizationwhich they formed a few years since, and whichis still in existence. Its receipts are very small,and it has hard work to keep its machinery in motion.—New York Journal of Commerce. dragged New York Journal of Commerce. 

 In the last Anti-Slavery Standard is a long and interestingletter from RICHARD D. WEEB, of Dublin,in which he announces the death of this belovedfriend, this veteran advocate of the slave, this earnestpleader for peace, this untiring teetotaller, &c. &c.,as follows: ICHARD EEB 'I don't think you ever knew JOHN MURRAY, of BowlingBay, near Glasgow, but you have surely heard ofhim, as in conjunction with Andrew Paton and WilliamSmeal, a great pillar of the Anti-Slavery cause inScotland. He is dead. He died about a month ago.I heard but a brief intimation of his decease, and thena letter containing some particulars from his son,James Oswald Murray. His death was the result ofrepeated attacks of paralysis, but he retained the possessionof his intellect, though his memory was somewhatdecayed, till the last, when he expired painfully,surrounded by his family. He was one for whomI had a feeling of affectionate veneration. He was ahomely, hearty, kindly, honest man, eminent for energy,moral courage and devotedness to the good ofhis fellow-creatures. He was a man to be honored, ahero of the true stamp, a genuine Christian. I think Igave you, some months ago, a sketch of a tour in theScotch highlands, that I made in company with afriend. On our return to Glasgow, we spent a daypleasantly, visiting some of those Anti-Slavery friendswith whom we had long been acquainted by reputationor correspondence. Our visit to Bowling Baywas to me the most interesting part of our wholeScottish tour. John Murray gave us 'a highlandwelcome,' and his family were as friendly as himself.His house is situated on the banks of the Clyde, nearthe foot of a lofty elevation, beautifully planted, andcommanding an extensive view over some of the forestland of Scotland. Although very infirm from arecent attack of the disease that was destined to carryhim off so soon, he insisted on accompanying uson a walk up the hill-aide, and we were struck withthe freshness of spirit, the kindliness and goodnessthat upheld him in his struggles with gigantic evils intimes when opposition to them was neither so easy norso popular as at present. His hospitable house wasalways open to the missionary of humanity, and hispurse ever ready for the promotion of good objects, andthis in the most unostentatious way, and sometimeswith little reference to the limited nature of his ownresources. All the American Abolitionists who havevisited Scotland within the last ten years will regretthe loss of this honest, large-hearted man.'

Then came the hisses, with whichthey occasionally vary their free discussions. Atlength a fat old lady, herself looking out of theeyes as if just cut of a lunatic asylum, waddled upto the foot of the platform, and pointing up to thespeaker, pronounced, in a shrill voice—'That man'scrazy.'

 The Centennial Celebration in honor of the settlementof Maiden came off on Tuesday, last week,amidst great splendor. The town was profusely decoratedwith flags, and the Military, Fire Department,and the various Lodges of Odd Fellows turned out ingreat numbers. At the close of the ceremonies, about2000 persons sat down to the dinner tables, whichwere well filled with the good things of that life.An oration was delivered by the Hon. J. Green, whena grand display of fireworks closed the festivities. Dreadful Disaster.—At Bridgewater, on the FallRiver roll road, last week, the train, when under fullheadway, struck a chaise containing two brothersnamed Henry and Ethan Leach, killing them both.One was dreadfully cut to pieces, and died instantly,and the other with both his ribs and legs broken, lingereduntil 11 o'clock, when he died.

Mr. Oviatt,when the preparations for execution were commenced. He was brought from his call in a chair apparentlyvery weak from loss of blood, but in full possessionof his senses. He called for water, and drank once ortwice, when he was conveyed to the scaffold by twomen, with his hands and legs firmly tied. The noosewas then adjusted about his neck, during which operationhe omitted one or two audible groans. Thewarrant for his execution was then read by SheriffEveleth, when the cap was placed over his head, therope cut, and the drop fell. The fall probably broke his neck, as after a fewstruggles, and a convulsive drawing up of the lowerlimbs, all was still. About one hundred persons were present in thejail yard, and the windows of the neighboring; houses.which overlooked the yard, were partly filled withmen and women, says and girls!

We learn that his uncle gives the following accountof his birth and former life:—He was born in Baltimore,and is 28 years of age. When about 15, hecame to this city, and went with his uncle on boardthe Eastern boats in the capacity of a servant. Afterwards,being fond of' high company,' as the uncleexpressed it, Goode left him and went to sea. Fromthat time, the uncle has seen him but occasionallywhen in port. His mother is supposed to be riving,but he seemed unwilling to talk about her. He statesthat he was in many battles of the Florida war, andserved under Gen. Taylor there. The attempt at suicide was a moat determined affair.According to the statement of the officers in attendance,the clergymen left him about nine o'clockat his expressed wish. He then desired all thosewho were to watch him to leave him the cell to himself,they stopping in the entry with the door open.He also blow out the candle, but a lantern was soplaced that the light could strike all parts of his bodybut the face. He was unwilling to converse with hiswatchers, and appeared to sleep. At a little beforetwelve, however, the officer heard a gurgling noise,and upon approaching, found that he had his thumbsand a portion of the blanket crammed down his throat.He was perfectly furious at their approach, and resistedtheir attempt to examine him with all hisstrength. He was found, however, to have cut botharms in at least a dozen places, with a small piece ofglass which he in some way had become possessed of.Dr. Smith was called in and his wounds dressed, butseveral times during the night he attempted to tear offthe bandages, which were, however, constantly replaced. Soon after, he began to vomit up pieces of tobaccoand wads of tarred paper, which he had swallowed.During the intervals of these sick turns, he is said tohave slept soundly for three quarters of en hour—aphenomenon often exhibited by criminals on thepoint of death. When he reached the gallows he said,' Lord, receive my soul'; but when the Sheriff askedhim if he was ready, he made no reply, being apparentlyinsensible.

Has the rude just, flowingfrom mouth to mouth, that 'by this time Goode wouldbe praying like thunder,' an item of gallows-terror inits composition? Are there any of the indications of awholesome example to be found in the fact, that theloud and general laugh of a large section of the crowdassembled in the vicinity of the place of execution,greeted the oath-ratified assertion that 'Goode andHarding would have a glorious hell-hunt in a fewminutes'? Can it be possible that any benefit couldarise from the example, in the very face of which anindividual consigned the soul of another to a namelesslocality in company with that of Goode, simplybecause he was jostled a little, or had his toes trampledupon? Was it a craving after an efficacious example,which induced the great body of the immoralscum of the dens and stews of vice and crime withinthe city to congregate near the gallows? Or, was ita similar desire to profit by example, which taughthundreds among the crowd to enquire whether orno he 'died game '? Were these immediate effects ofthat example, allied to many other grossnesses of notand expression, proof, in any particular, that the grandend of punishment by the rope and gallows had thatefficacy their advocates so strenuously uphold themto have? Is the very general buoyancy of conductand conversation among the crowd at Leverett StreetJail, this morning, an honest ratification of the opinionthat the gallows is an immediate and effectual improverof the public morals? Our own conviction,which has been tempered by the observance of the resultsof many similar scenes, says emphatically, No!The awfully disgusting and disgracing example of apublic execution 'dies and leaves no sign,' only on thetortured sympathies of those who require it not; andwe know of none who do desiderate a lesson writtenwith the implements of murder, accompanied by horrorswhich would altogether banish the faculty ofconsideration from the mind. How can any applicationof legal murder, at an example, sit down easilyon the mind lacerated to the raw by the most unbearablehorror and disgust at the deliberate bloodshedperpetrated within the range of its view? Convictiondoes not come through that channel tanjiiimia permanent residence in the heart. It comes fanaly;and if there is one patent path on which it can travelwith effiency, it is through the medium of the godlikepractice of mercy and forbearance. immediate that Goode has been executed; and what prospectivebenefit is to be obtained by the act which encompassedhis death? 'He is gone,' said one of a knot ofyouths as they left the scene—' and he's a daredsight happier than any of us: I'm blessed if he isn't!'Here, then, was a specimen of the evaporative effectof the death punishment example. 'Wouldn't I haveliked to have seen the black b—get the everlastingswing? said a youth not above fourteen years of age.This was a sample, too, of the resemblances of chokinga fallow-creature now and then for the special gratificationof the hundreds who thought with the youth—and if the hundreds did not, what did they at theplace of execution at all?' 

 The 'Anniversaries,' as the week draws near to aclose, go on much more spiritedly that they did duringthe first two or three days. So far, we haveKept our readers pretty well posted up with the interestingdoings of such of our really philanthropicand religious societies as the public take, or aresupposed to take, any real interest in; omitting forthe most part the rabid incoherencies of the anti-slaveryites,under the lead of Garrison, Phillips, AbbyKelley Foster, and others of that ilk.

However, if there be any of our friendsfurious enough to know what is now saying anddoing, and ranting, at the Tabernacle, they will findIt all faithfully reported in the Express for the secondweek of May, 1848. The same speeches thatwere made then, about a 'dissolution of the Union,'the same blackguardism of the Christian Church,North and South, and nearly about the same unbridledinvective against the good men of all sectionsof the Union, now literally repeating over again, andrepeated now so often that they have not even thelittle merit of novelty they once possessed. Theclergy, the government, State and national; our variouspolitical and philanthropic institutions, no matterhow sacred, or bow respected—every thing andevery body, in fact, upon which they can vomit theirribaldry, are damned and denounced in terms thatwould better become the spirits of darkness thanmen claiming to be rational human beings. ranting These yearly fulminations of wrath and bitterness,however, are not without their uses, as we have oftenbefore remarked.

 But pre-eminent above all in wild foolery andfaint virulence, were the proceedings of the Anti-SlaverySociety. It is not our purpose or desire toadvocate the cause of slavery—we leave the entiresubject to men better qualified to discuss it. But noman of sober sense could listen without contemptand derision to the fierce tirades in which these'apostles' have indulged. Such specimens of declamationwithout argument, of passionate tepidness,of personal abuse, as were born of the agonizingthroes of these gentlemen's feeble fury, it has neverbeen our fortune to hear before. No one, we fancy,will believe that converts to any cause can be gainedby intemperance of expression, or that venomousmalice will enhance philanthropy. 

 We call him Rev., though we are told that many ofthe reverends do not admit that he ever belonged totheir member. We believe he was not graduated froma college or theological seminary, but he felt himselfcalled to preach in one of the dipped sects, was aMillierite and revivalist, and believed in eternal punishmentof the wicked. By circumstantial evidence,he was convinced in the Court of Common Pleas ofGrafton County, N.H., for the murder of his wife.By the kindness of a friend who was in Haverhillon Wednesday, we are enabled to give all the factsand circumstances in relation to his execution whichare of any importance to our readers. We most feelinglyand earnestly command these stubborn facts tothe consideration of the advocate of hanging, andespecially to clergymen. clergymen. The law of New Hampshire is similar to our ownin regard to the privacy of execution. It is to beconfined to the jail yard and a privileged few. Thegreat lesson of the gallows is to be kept, probably onthe same principle that the Roman Catholics havekept the Bible, from the vulgar. The very men who,if any, need the lemon, most take it only at dull secondhand. But as the jail yard is a very email enclosure,the admirers of the hangorama well knewthat it could not be hid from thorn. So they flockedinto Haverhill by thousands, from the distance ofthirty or forty miles, early m the morning, men andwomen. And the first thing they did was to qualifythemselves for the great moral instruction, by petitionsof New England rum. The rum tavern had todouble ha force to deal out the distilled damnationfast enough to satisfy the thirst of some 3000 pupilsof the gallows. The woman at first exhibited sometimidity in taking their place near the fatal jail yard,but one mere bold than the rest leading the way, theyrushed on, and scouring a good position, kept it from8 in the morning to 2, P.M., in anticipation of thespectacle. No sympathy with the sufferer found themthere. What daughters, what wires, what mothers,think you, are they? andwomen. Our friend passed freely through the crowd, andby being a perfect stranger, was able to gather theexact sons and spirit of it. The men crowded, cursedand joked. The boys climbed trees, laughed andshouted. The maudlin drunkards staggered, andheld themselves up by poem and fences. By theway, the officers, to gratify the crowd, so for evadedthe law as to build the platform at a great height, soas to be in the plain view of all. The gallows was asingle joist projecting from a window above. Whenthe victim dropped through the platform, he was, inobedience to the law, to drop out of the sight of thecrowd, so that the lessen should be clipped to thisextent of its fair proportions. But the hopeful youngsterson the trees, and the people on the neighboringbuildings, defeated this modesty of the law, and hada fair view of the whole. fair By very careful and discreet inquiry, it was ascertainedthat the motley crowd, drunk and sober, menand women, were almost unanimously strong in thefaith of capital punishments, and what is more, wereprepared to defend their faith from the scriptures. 'Do you think this is right?' asked our friend. 'Right! to be sure I do,' replied a ferocious rummy.'Whose sheddeth man's blood, by man shell hisblood be shed, by G—d.' 'But do yon find that in the New Testament?' addedour friend. 'Why, d—n it, if we give up one part of theBible, we may as well give up the whole,' rejoinedthe serious theologian. Indead, the whom crowd seemed perfectly preparedin the Scripture proofs, and by quoting all the strongtexts, they contrived to strengthen themselves for thefive or six mortal hours in which it was their destinyto stand reeking in foul air and blasphemy, for thegratification of that feeling on which theology reliesfor the safety of man's government and God's. The platform was occupied by a number of clergymen,and Sheriff of the neighboring countries, whocome to see their brother Keteh into through his uglyjob. In the midst of them, Wider Dudley came forward,attended by Sheriff Powers, and the chaplainof the prices. He asked and obtained leave to speak,and in a few words, uttered in a firm, loud tons, heSOLEMNLY ARMSTED  OF THECRIME FOR WHICH HE WAS TO CUTTER, and expressedhis hope of heaven, to which he was confident hecould go from the gallows as well as any other place.Sealing his  with an address to his Maker,the sheriff did his Christian duty (!) and the life waschoked out of the clay!   With smiles of satisfaction and curses of delight,the  crowd retired to renew their potutions atthe tavers, and he pressure for more of the murderand was perfectly impenetrable.

 Mr. Wentworth, in writing to the Chicago Democratin a few lines places the injustice of the presentslave representation in a light where no one canfail to understand it He says: 'In the lower House, the South, with a popularvote of $46,002, has 34 members, while the North,with a vote of 1,934,005, has a representation of only140! The States of New York and Pennsylvania,with a popular vote equal to that of the whole South,are represented by 58 members in the lower House;the South by 84! The Stats of Wisconsin, with avote of 38,166, is represented by 2 members in thelower House; while Texas, with a vote of less thana third—12,654, is represented by the same number!Illinois, with a vote of 125,648, is represented by 7members in the lower House; while Virginia, with avote of only 91,536, is represented by 15! more thandouble.' The South tauntingly asks, What have see to dowith slavery? A more impertinent question couldscarcely be expressed. Had we no more palpableconnection with slavery than that moral interest andgeneral responsibility which all good men owe to thecause of truth and liberty the world over, this wouldbe a sufficient reason for the exertion of every energyagainst the evil; but nearly all our political andeven ecclesiastical relations are involved in the vilesystem. It besets us continually with its embarrassmentsand infamy; at home we must sacrifice to it,abroad be dishonored by it. What has the North todo with slavery? Look at the above facts, and sayif a magnanimous and self respecting people—if anybut slaves and cowards—can abide such facts withgagged mouths? It is not discussions of theNorth that encroach upon the South, but the slaveryof the South that encroaches upon and degrades theNorth. How, in the name of our honor and our everyinterest, how is it that the North, with the aggregatecommerce, manufactories, intelligences, internalimprovements, and real force of the nation, has solong cringed obsequiously before the impotent bravoismof the emasculated slave States? She can doso no more. Her determined people will compeltheir representatives to abandon this cowardly anddisgraceful subservience.

Garnet and Ward on this occasioncommented severely on the views of those who areapposed to abolitionists making special efforts to the Bible to the slaves. At this stage of themeeting, C.L.

 This body met in the afternoon, immediately afterthe adjournment of the American Anti-Slavery Society.We were unable to be present at ha commencement,or to remain daring its entire proceedings.We heard only an abstract of the annual reportread by Lewis Tappan, Esq. The documentsseamed to give a minute history of events affectingthe anti-slavery cause during the lest year, and willdoubtless be valuable. After the reading of the reportwas finished, the President announced that musicwould be the next thing in order: thereuponfour young boys, known as the Luca family, cameupon the platform, and sung an anti-slavery song tothe tune of 'Old Dan Tucker,' very much to theamusement of the audience. They were encored,and greatly gratified their audience by compliance.This stopping at ouch a stage of the proceedings ofso grave an assembly, to have a tune performed bya boy, on a piano, struck us as rather wanting intaste, to say the least At the close of this song. Mr.Bibb took the platform to second a resolution proposingto give Bibles to the slaves, and made a longspeech in favor of this moat absurd and extraordinaryproposition, The speech was as aboard as theproposition it was intended to support. We haveoften heard Mr. Bibb, and generally with pleasureand profit, especially when he has confined himselfto a statement of his own personal sufferings as aslave, and those of his wife, still in cruel bondage.Upon such a theme, Mr. Bibb is always interesting,touching and powerful Beyond that, heis weak, insipid, and powerless. His address on the present occasion was made upof a most illogical display of cant phrases about theBible, its power to abolish slavery if given to theslave, &c. It was a poor thing, which would dovery well for that namby-pamby class of parsons inour country, who care a great deal about the souls ofmen, but care nothing about their bodies. Thereare many such in this country, who would give adollar towards giving the slave a Bible, but whowould not give a cent to give the slave himself. Thespeech might have been a very proper one for theanniversary of the American Bible Society—madeup in part of slaveholders and slave-traders—but itsounded quite odd in an anti-slavery meeting. We did not stay till Mr. Bibb finished his speech,but left him beating the air. We were informedthat Mr. Ward followed Mr. Bibb, and made a speechwhich greatly relieved the audience of the stuporinduced by listening to Mr. Bibb. Upon this matter of giving Bibles to the slave, wehave a few remarks to make and a few questions toask. The first is, that from the very nature of the relationof master and slave, it seems impossible to givethe Bible to the slave without the consent of themaster. He is property in the eye of his master, notless than in the eye of the law. And it does seemmoat obvious to common sense, that properly cannotearn property, even in the shape of a Bible. It isequally plain, that the slaveholder is not libely togive his consent to any measure which will in anyway destroy or decreases the value of his property inhuman fresh. Nor is it less plain that the commentof the slaveholder to give Bibles most be obtained,if obtained at all, by some one in no way suspectedof abolitionists. properly property These positions being true, how is it possiblethat the slaves can have the Bible while they remainunder the power and control of their masters? It isall well enough perhaps to say that the slave oughtto have the Bible; to say that, as a human being, heis entitled to it, and that we ought to give it to him.But the question of its practicability will still forceitself upon the mind, and demand how this thing is tobe done. The Bible, no more than any other book,has within itself the power of locomotion, and if itgoes from the North to the South, it most be carried.The question is, who will carry the Bible, andgive it to the slave? Will Mr. Bibb? Will those whoencourage him to advocate the measure, go thereand circulate the Bible? They mean to do no suchthing, at least in the present state of the public mindthere. The troth is, slavery and the Bible are atwar with each other, and the slave cannot really havethe Bible while he is a slave. Our duty is thereforeto devote all our energies to giving the slave tohimself, as the only condition upon which he canhave the Bible.—T.B.

 At the late anniversary of the American Anti-SlaverySociety, held in the Tabernacle, the President,in the opening of the meeting, said he had seen hisname among those advertised as speakers for the occasion;but, instead of making a speech himself, hewould read from the writings of persons whose characterswere well established. He proceeded to readfrom the Prophets a series of selections, embodyingan amount and power of exposure, rebuke, denunciationand admonition, applicable to this nation, underits present character, as one would hardly havethought those Scriptures contained.

 The American Anti-Slavery Society drew togethera large, vary attentive and orderly, though, asusual, somewhat promiscuous assemblage, in theTabernacle. There were not so many antagonisticelements in the meeting as has heretofore been thecase; the company of scoffers, idlers, and disturbersof the peace, was reduced almost to invisibility;while the pervading tons of the meeting, though itcould not but be bold, decided, and uncompromising.was far from the extravagance and offensive denunciationwhich have so often left an unfavorable impressionon the made of considerate, discriminatingspectators. Parker Pillsbury spoke like a Christian—strong, free, direct—boldly rebuking the churchesfor their criminal apathy and delinquency in behalfof the slave, but abstaining from those flippant innuendoeswhich have led many to accuse him of irreverence,and some, of infidelity. The great attractionof this meeting, however, as well as that oftwo meetings of the Anti-Capital Punishment Society,was the flowing, flashed, classical eloquence ofWendell Phillips. I heard it remarked, by rather aneccentric critic, that Phillips was admirable, perfectin his kind, but was altogether destitute of he rowdyelement in his composition—that he did not knowhow to use either tobacco or profane language. Thelatter accomplishments, however, are of such easyattainment, that one cannot greatly regret their absencein the distinguished Massachusetts orator. Itis true that Phillips never forgets his taste or hisbreeding; he is always he gentleman, however vehement,or even fierce, his denunciations; and youmight look in vain, during his most tempestuousharangues, for a flaw in his emaciation, his emphasis,or his Illustrations, in the arrangement of hissentences, or the construction of his argument. Butthis very characteristic gives him an immense powerwith a popular audience. It is a great mistake to suppose that the people,even the most uncultivated and ignorant, are  ofco, vulgarity, or any expression of bad taste,in a public speaker.

 Brief telegraphic dispatches, containing a summaryof the doings of the organized forces of Nullificationfrom the difference sections of the PalmettoState, which held in  at Columbia, have beenalready laid be our readers. The Columbia papershave  reached us wit a fuller abstract ofthe proceedings. Unlike the Northern Disunionists,who give full reports of their doings, Mr. Calhoun'sfriends at the South give but meager accountsof their operations, for fear, most likely, ofthe odium which much attach to their doctrines. Thequestion of discussion and non-intercourse with theNorth in understood to have been discussed quiteheartily at Columbia on the 14th and 15th of May.    The first day was occupied mostly in choosingofficers, and in the offering of sundry propositions andresolutions, none of which were acted upon. Hon.D.E. HUGER, of Charleston, was appointed President,who addressed the mating for nearly twohours, in a train of 'patriotism, reciting the wrongsattempted to be inflicted on the South, and urgingupon the people of the State in whose service he hasbeen so long, to act with firmness and discretion, andin that spirit which the crisis demanded.' UGER Among the prominent actors in this farce were F.H.Elmore, C.G. Memeninger, John E. Carew, F.W.Pickens, A.G. Sumner, Wade Hampton, E. Sill,J.D. Witherspoon and many others, all known asprominent leaden of the so-called 'Democratic' party.The Convention was as entirely partisan as itwas sectional. It was a purely political affair, anddesigned to make capital for the Loco-focos, who inother Southern States pretend to be the only truefriends of the South sad her institutions. By the following resolutions, which were presentedthe 15th inst, and prepared by a Committee oftwenty-one, (composed of Messrs. F.H. Elmore,Chairman: Wm. DaBose, Wm. Kain, N.R. Eaves,Z.P. Herndon, J.D. Witherspoon, Robert Cunningham,B.F. Perry, Jas. L. Orr, R.F.W. Allston, J.A.Dargan, W.J. Hanna. F.W. Pickens, S. Fair,Henry Arthur, J.P. Richardson, J.H. Means, Jas.Chesnut, Jr., D.J. McCord, M.E. Carn, T.F. Drayton,)it will be perceived that the South Carolina Disunionistshave made thorough preparations for resistingthe Nation in case Slavery be excluded by Congressfrom the Territories, or abolished anywhereelse: Resolved, That a full and deliberate examinationof the whole subject has forced a deep conviction onthe Delegates of the Committees of Safety here assembled,from the several districts and parishes ofthe State, that alarming and imminent peril is hangingover the institutions and sovereign rights of theslaveholding States, caused by unconstitutional andmischievous interference with our domestic slaveryand the rights of slaveholders, on the part of the peopleof the North, their Legislatures, Courts, and Representativesin Congress, and by withholding from themthe aids and remedies guaranteed by the Constitution.That arguments and appeals to cease and abstainfrom this course of unprovoked wrong and insulthave been exhausted in unavailing efforts whichhave only been followed by repetitions of injury, andaggressions more alarming, persevered in with anappearance of concert and determination which leavesus no alternative but abject and humiliating submission,or a like concert and determination in maintainingour constitutional rights, and in defendingour property thus wantonly put in danger. ThatSouth Carolina should stand prepared, as she now is,to enter into council, and to take that 'firm, unitedand concerted action' with other Southern and SouthwesternStates in this emergency, which the preservationof their common honor, sovereignty and constitutionalprivileges demand, and to maintain themat every hazard, and to the last extremity—and that,in view of this alarming condition of public affairs, aCentral State Committee of Vigilance and Safety, toconsist of five members, be now raised by ballot, tocorrespond with other Committees and persons inthis and other States, with a view to such concertedand united measures as may be expedient in anyemergency that may arise. Resolved, That we entirely approve 'The Addressof Southern Delegates in Congress to their Constituents,'and the wise and patriotic course of those Senatorsand Representatives who signed the same. Resolved, That we confide implicitly in the wisdomand firmness of the State authorities for maintainingour Constitutional rights, equality and honor,and that we heartily approve the course hitherto adoptedby them in relation to the aggressions of thenon-slaveholding States. Resolved, That we would regard the passage byCongress of the Wilmot Proviso, or any measure forabolishing slavery or the slave-trade, or the admittingslaves to vote in the District of Columbia, or of anyequivalent measure, as a direct attack upon the Institutionsof the Slaveholding States, and as such to beresisted by them at every hazard; and that in eitherof such events, the Governor be, and he is hereby requestedto convene the Legislature, if it is not in session,to consider the mode and measure of redress. Resolved, That we do concur in and adopt theresolutions which have twice been confirmed by theLegislature of Virginia, as containing the clearestexposition of the rights and duties of the severalStates, feeling and believing that she will continuefirm and resolute in maintaining what she has announcedwith so much wisdom and deliberation, andthat the liberties, honor and interest of the SlaveholdingStates will be safe under her lead. The question was taken on the first resolution,which was adopted without one dissenting voice.The 2d, 3d and 4th resolutions were then separatelyproposed, and unanimously concurred in without anycomments or discussion. Wm. H. Hutton of OrangeDistrict, proposed an additional clause, farther expressiveof a determination to resist at all and everyhazard. He also took the opportunity of deprecatingeven the appearance of irresolution, as it would lead tothe most 'fatal' consequences, and deceive them intoa false security. He was for the strongest measures,as those whom he represented were preparedfor any emergency that might arise, and at ail times,and under all circumstances, would be found ready. Mr. McCord followed in a speech ranging 'fromgay to grave, from lively to severe'—'now dilatingan the insults and injuries inflicted on the South, andnow exposing the ignorance and hypocrisy of her assailants.'When he had concluded, the question wastaken on the last resolution, which was adopted unanimously.A resolution was introduced by Mr.Thompson, returning thanks to certain gentlemenfor their efforts in behalf of Southern rights, which,after some little discussion between the mover andMessrs. Moses and Eaves, was withdrawn by the former. Mr. Eaves proposed the following additional Resolution,(independent of those already adopted,) whichwas agreed to: Resolved, That we earnestly recommend to theseveral Districts and Parishes, as an essential measure,to preserve perfect their organizations of Committeesof Vigilance and Safety, for the purpose ofcorrespondence and conceit of action, and especiallyto exert themselves to spread useful information beforethe people, and to detect and bring to justice alloffenders against our peace and institutions. Mr. Herndon then moved the appointment of aCommittee of twenty-one, to nominate suitable personsto constitute the Executive Committee of five,which was agreed to. The following gentlemenwere then nominated, ballotted for, and elected: F.H.Elmore, Chairman: Wade Hampton, D.L. McCord,James Gadsden, F.W. Pickens. After whichshe Convention transacted some unimportant business,and adjourned sinc dis. Previous to the adjournment,Messrs. Elmore. James A. Strobbart, J.A.Black, Perry, Thomas H. Pope, Huger A.C.

His concluding topic, after sundry matters of counsel,was the necessity of prayer, and a devotionalspirit.(!) Friday, May 18. Friday, May 18. Memorials.—The memorials from the Presbyterieswere called for. Several on the subject of slavery,some on the division of General Assembly and othersubjects, were presented. Memorials. Rev. Mr. Hoyt moved the reference of the memorialson slavery to a special committee. Rev. Dr. Leach thought that, unless there wassome particular unfitness in the committee of billsand overtures, this subject should not be made anexception to the general rule respecting memorials.Rev. Mr. Boardman and Rev. Mr. Hickok forciblysustained the same view. Rev. Mr. Little was anxiousthat a fair committee, representing the variousviews of the Assembly, should have charge ofthis whole subject It would be much more satisfactory,and probably save time. Mr. Hoyt finally withdrewhis motion. Rev. Dr. Hall moved that the several memorialsbe first read, and then referred to appropriate committees.It was replied that the custom bad alwaysbeen to refer every memorial to the committee onbills and overtures, whose duty it is to distributethem to the proper committees, and to bring beforethe Assembly whatever papers were necessary tomake the subject to which they relate known. Itwas accordingly decided that memorials of everykind should first go into the hands of the committeeon bills and overtures. Saturday, May 19. Saturday, May Slavery—Memorials were brought in by the committeeon bills and overtures on this subject, fromthe Synod of Ohio; the Presbyteries of Trumbull;of Hamilton; of Pennsylvania, (asking a pastoral letteron the subject;) of Palestine, (intimating theywill separate if some action be not taken on the subject;)of Franklin, (asking for a division of church inorder to relieve it from the difficulties;) also memorialsfrom J. Kimball and others, asking to have slaveryplaced in the category of disciplinary offences;from the Synod of Indiana, asking a fraternal letter;from the Presbytery of Huron; the Presbytery ofHamilton, concurring with the action of the Synod ofCincinnati; the church in Jersey, Illinois; thePresbytery of Des Moines, asking a separation fromslavery; and from the Presbytery of Meadville, onthe same subject It was proposed to raise a specialcommittee on the subject Slavery Dr. Leach opposed this. It had hitherto been thecustom to entrust this subject to the committee ofbills and overtures, where these memorials were suppressed,and not suffered to come before the house.The Assembly has already done all that it can do, onthis subject This is a very delicate and difficultsubject, and the churches at the South are placed ina very difficult position. The action of abolitionistsat the North has vastly embarrassed them. Thewell-meant, but unwise precipitation of brethren atthe North, who desired to do us good faster than itcould be done, has retarded the progress of emancipationin Virginia. If the South had been let aloneon this subject, long before this, he believed, a mostdesirable event would have been secured. Therewere measures in progress at the commencement ofthis abolition excitement, for the eradication of shiveryfrom Virginia, which were obstructed by this unwiseand most injurious agitation, and which cannever regain their popularity and effect until this agitationsubsides. The Assembly has done its fullshare to protract this unfortunate state of things. Thediscussions which have been allowed on this floor,have operated to fan the prejudice and awaken thefears of the South, which have not only stood in theway of all judicious action, but have jeoparded theinfluence, if not lives of members of the Church. What can the Assembly do more than it has done?It has borne Ha testimony, and further action, underthe present constitution and order of discipline, is impossible.What if the General Assembly should gofarther, and pronounce the relation of slaveholding asin, and direct the lower judicatories to institute disciplinaryprocess. Would its mandate be obeyed?Do yon suppose there is a single Presbytery of thischurch in all the South that would pay the lest regardto such an injunction? Self-preservation is thefirst law of nature; and it would be the instinct ofSouthern ministers and churches, that to comply withsuch a requisition would be to destroy themselves.Yes, the moment that it was understood that thePresbyterian Church took such ground as this, woulddate the expulsion of every minister of us from ourpulpits. And if we are driven away, who will takeour places? Will these memorialists go, in the faceof popular fury, to preach the gospel to the South?  The South has enough to do to retain its connectionwith this body, without being forced to beargreater burdens. We have suffered the loss of allthings for your sake already. Before the division in'37, the Presbyterian Church was in the majority,and had a commanding influence. But that rupturetook from us the greater part of the ministers andchurches; a majority, which the grounds on whichthat division was understood at the South to be made,greatly increased. We have had to contend withthe reproach and feebleness of small numbers, andthe worse reproach of connection with a body continuallytaking offensive ground, in this, the metdelicate and sensitive of all subjects. When Dr.Baxter and Mr. Sanderson, the delegates from ourown Presbytery, returned from General Assembly in'37, as they drove into the streets in the public coach,they cried out, before the coach stopped, as they sawtheir brethren gathering round, 'Brethren, do notblame us for what has been done; we have at lestE rid of the Abolitionists.' And this was the cry:Old School Church has cat off the abolitionists.We were obliged to suffer the odium of the implicationof being connected with the abolitionists; andthat implication, your incessant agitation of thesubject on this floor has helped to Keep up. Wewant rest We are able to take care of ourselves.We need no Northern interference. The GeneralAssembly has done all it can do, and more than itever ought to have done, and the matter ought tostop here. You will certainly drive as cat We lovepeace and union, and are ready to adhere to you atalmost any sacrifice; but, adherence will become animpossibility, if you do not cease to vex us year byyear, with the agitation which the force of Westerninfluence process upon you. Dr. Leash's remarks were very animated, and deliveredin quite a Southern tone; yet seemed to attractbut little attention. Dr. Be followed him, in a quiet manner, deprecatingthe discussion of the subject at this stageof affirm. The special committee was chosen almost. The moderator claimed a littletime to prepare it.   A communication from Kiot Cresson, Esq., Secretaryof the Colonization Society, accompanied by onehundred copies of the Colonization Held, containingthe  of Rev. Dr. Parker, on the subject of Colonization,and received, and the gift was accepted,and the thanks of the Assembly returned therefore.    Monday, May 21.

Tuesday, May 26. Tuesday, May The order of the day, being the proposition to interchangecorresponding delegates with the OldSchool General Assembly, was next taken up debated.  The mover, Rev. Dr. Sp, then addressedthe Assembly, in its favor, as a movement for theinterests of Christianity.  Rev. Dr. Judd, or Geneva, in a few remarks expressedhis detestation of the conduct of the otherGeneral Assembly, but his belief was that therewere good man and kindly feelings among them, andhe would support the preposition. Rev. Dr. Bollard, although he had previously opposedthe motion, gave notice that he would supportit. Somebody was to be dishonored; other thisAssembly by the rejection of the proposition, or theother Assembly by a similar act. As a Christian, hecould not but act with charity and generality, andreturn good for evil. Rev. Mr. Bassett strongly opposed it, because ofthe pro-slavery course of the other General Assembly.He had been sent here by his Presbytery toexpress this class of sentiments, and he was so instructed.If this motion was carried, it would recognizeas worthy Christian brethren those who werenot so. This question could not be shirked, and itwould be inconsistent in hose who did so to takeanti-slavery ground on other matters. Rev. Mr. Beecher followed. He was an anti-slaveryman up to the hub, but he repudiated theground taken by Mr. Bassett. If this ground werecarried out, of refusing correspondence with theother Assembly because of imputed errors of conduct,what church could this Assembly have communionwith? Rev. James H.C. Leach, D.D., of Hanover, Va.,opposed the anti-slavery ground taken by Mr. Bassett.It was not true that the Old School Assemblyhad thrown a veil over the vice of slavery. Theyhad spoken out strongly enough about the matter.Mr. Leach also answered the argument of Mr. E.Wright, that the division in the Assembly, on theproposition, would operate unfavorably on the otherAssembly. The division would not be sent over thetelegraphic wires—nothing but the resolution, andhe hoped that it would pass by as large a majorityas possible. Rev. Mr. Boardman, of Otsego, also addressedthe Assembly in favor of the motion, and was followedby a large number of others, after which, thevote being taken on the motion to postpone indefinitely,stood, yeas 48, nays 59. Again a discursive debate ensued, after which, amotion being made to refer the matter to a committeeof five, to report to the next General Assembly,it was carried. Wednesday, May 23. Wednesday, May The special committee on the subject of slaverymade a report, which was received with much solemnity,the impression seeming to prevail that troublewas to be anticipated from the agitation of thematter. The report was upon memorials from foursynods, thirteen presbyteries, one church, and oneindividual, all asking the freeing of the church fromall participation in the sin of slavery, one presbyteryeven threatening secession, unless something wasdone for that purpose. The report was quite an ableone, recommending that the action of all from thePresbyterian Assemblies be reiterated; and from theextracts they made from the minutes on the subject,they educed the following propositions, which theyrecommended to the adoption of the Assemby: 1st The right of man to civil liberty. 3d. Slavery is unrighteous, and opposed to the interestsof all concerned in it. 3d. The duty of Christians to use all righteous endeavorsto effect the extirpation of the evil. 4th. Enjoining upon Christians to abstain frombuying and selling slaves, undue severity to them,or the separation of members of families, by any actof theirs. 5th. The Assembly knows of no members of thechurch participating in the evils alluded to, but ifthere are any, the attention of the proper church judicatoriesis called to the same. This report was received with general favor, anda motion was made to adopt it. Pending this, the Rev. Mr. Bassett offered the followingsubstitute: Resolved, That slavery is a great sin before Godand man, and should be treated by the church in thesame way as other gross immoralities. Upon this resolution he addressed the Assembly atlength, giving a wide scope to his remarks on thevices of slavery. Mr. Bassett spoke till the hour of adjournmentof the morning session. In the afternoon, the debate was resumed, andseveral speeches, remarkable for fervid eloquence,were delivered by Chief Justice Hornblower, andRev. Messrs. Beecher, Bollard, and others, afterwhich the vote was taken, and the substitute of Mr.Bassett was lost, and the original report was adoptedby a very large majority. Mr. Tyler, of Mississippi, offered an additionalresolution, but afterwards withdrew it. After the transaction of some unimportant business,the minutes were read and adopted, and theAssembly then adjourned sine die.

White,Thomas Van Renesalaer, and others, participated. Theattendance was numerous, and in the evening, theMelodeon was crowded to its utmost capacity. It wasa most impressive and thrilling occasion. No lessthan six fugitives from slavery were on the platform,depending for their safety from the grasp of the slavehunters solely on the humanity of the people as againstthe Constitution and laws of the land. W.W. Brownreferred to their situation in a touching and eloquentmanner, and the sympathies of the vast assembly weremanifested by the strongest demonstrations. Mr.Phillips made the closing speech, which was one ofhis best efforts. Next week we expect to give a prettyfall report of the proceedings. 

 BOOK, NEWSPAPER AND JOB PRINTERS LANCESTER  21 CORNHILL. ANCESTER  ORNHILL. 

 The New England Anti-Slavery Convention, whichwas hold in this city in May, 1848, after fall discussion,unanimously adopted the following resolution: 'Resolved, That, anxious to make the best possibleuse of every opportunity which Providence affordsof gaining the ear and rousing the heart of the nation,we recommend to the Massachusetts Anti-SlaverySociety to hold, as soon as convenient and profitable,a series of One Hundred Conventions, to press onpublic notice the guilty position of the State in respectto national slavery,—-and to urge a dissolutionof that Union which there is no hops of changing;which links us to such responsibility, and shuts upin our jails, in the keeping of our agents, the noblestfriends of humanity, and the best lovers of theirkind.' With a further resolution, pledging to the Mass. Anti-SlaverySociety the funds raised at the Convention. The General Agent of the Massachusetts Society,to whom, in connexion with his Associate Agents,was committed the duty of arranging and conductingthe Conventions provided for by this vote, hasthought it his duty, t this re-assembling of the New-EnglandAnti-Slavery Convention, to submit a briefStatement or Report of as much of the operations oflast year as grew out of the resolutions just read.For although it be true that this Convention is not apermanent body, it may safely be taken for grantedthat the individuals composing it, from, year to year,are so far the same as to constitute it, In effect, oneand the same body. In accordance with the resolutions before-mentioned,the following persons were engaged, and havebeen employed as lecturing agents, far different periodsof time, viz: Parker Pillsbury, Stephen S. Foster,Abby Kelley Foster, Lacy Stone, Adin Ballou,William W. Brown, E.D. Hudson, and Jean S. Jacobs.The General Agent also has attended the Conventionsas frequently as was consistent with his otherengagements. In addition to the above, the occasional and mostvaluable aid of Wm. L. Garrison, Wendell Phillips,Edmund Quincy, James N. Buffum, Oliver Johnson,and Wm. P. Atkinson has been freely given to thefurtherance of the work. Samuel Brooks, of Ohio, acted as Financial Agentduring the autumn and winter. The first Convention was held on the 18th of June;and they were continued, as often as circumstanceswould permit, for nearly eleven months. A full andvaluable report, of a portion of these held in the interiorof this State last summer, was made at thetime by Adin Ballou, and published: in the 'PracticalChristian' and the 'Liberator.' The whole number of Conventions held has beenseventy-one. It is s matter of deep regret to us thatwe were not able to complete the entire number contemplated.But, in consequence of the insufficiencyof the funds at the disposal of the Board of Managersof the Mass. Society, we were unable to retainthe services, longer than to the first of January, of Mr.and Mrs. Foster, notwithstanding that the latter, asusual, had given her services to the cause. We werethus deprived of aid, upon which we had amended,to enable us fully to carry oat the plan of One HundredConventions. Still, we rejoice to say, their serviceswere not lost to the cause. Though not actingan agents of the Mass, Society, since the first of January,they continued in the field, is practical unionwith us, and in various sections of this State renderedmost essential aid to our common object. If we addthe meetings, thus held by Mr. and Mrs. Foster, tothose held by the agents of the Mass. Society, thewhole number of Conventions held will be almostninety. It should be borne in mind, however, that,in the statements of this Report, reference is had tono more than the seventy-one Conventions actuallyattended by agents of the Mass. Society. seventy-one. given Conventions. ninety. The Conventions have been held in five of the New-EnglandStates, as follows:— Table  Table  The fifty-eight held in Massachusetts were thandistributed:— Table  Table  Mr. and Mrs.  meetings were mostly hold in and  counties.     of this or any of its  of have  the most is still a field for which ought to be coun we know, one to  there with these is at hand when this be accomplished.                      In  with the slavery lectures have been given by . Pillsbury,, , W.W. Brown, and Miss ; the number of these we cannot give.        Of the seventy-one Conventions, forty-seven wereheld on Sundays; the remaining twenty-four on other. The  of 'week-days' have beenmostly occupied by the lectures.   In a few instances, we have had the cordial welcomeand support  Christian ministers resident in thetown or neighborhood whose we were assembled.They have been willing and glad to  with us inproclaiming liberty to the captive, and in  tobreak his chain. They were not  or  towork in company with those, who had because of hisreputation for the slave's sake. But the number ofsuch has been very smell. Our common and all butuniversal experience is of the indifference or the hostilityof the so-called ministers and churches to thewhole subject of Anti-Slavery. Of such man we havenot hesitated to speak as  of Christ's nameand authority; 'in sheep's clothing,' indeed, 'but inwardlyravening wolves.' We may not have promotedour popularity by this causes, but we believewe have  the truth.      ministers churches   Of the funds raised and pledged at the last N.E.Convention, $700 only could be appropriated to theseConventions; of which about $600 have been paidin. Collections were also made at each of the Conventionsheld, with a view to defray local expenses,such as advertising, rent of halls, fuel, and lights,About $650 were raised in this way, a man quite adequate,it is believed, to meet all the local expenses:—compellingus, however, to fall back upon the smallfund of $600, above referred to and upon such fartherdonations as the friends of the cause were pleased tomake to the treasury of the Mass. Anti-Slavery Society,for the support of our agents. At the severalConventions, about 225 new subscribers to the anti-slaverypapers were procured. It were In vain that the writer of this should attemptto speak of the many interesting incidentssad discussions attending this important series ofmeetings; for important, in the bet sense of theword, we believe them to have been. In suit cases,the intent felt in them has been attested in thestrongest manner by the large numbers attendingthem, and the depth of feeling manifestly aroused.The agents, who have been present, are witnesses tothat interest, and have no doubt that great good tothe cause of Freedom, of Justice, of Right of Humanity,has been accomplished by means of thesemeetings; and waste no harvest has yet appeared,they assuredly know that it will appear in harvest-time;for the ground has been prepared—the goodground of honest and good hearts; the good seed ofthe word has been patiently sown, in the fear of Godand in the love of man, and a glorious harvest mustfollow. The word of God is pledged for it. In thisfaith they have their best reward, and their strongestencouragement to continue steadfast in a cause forwhich it is, their hope and their purpose to labor,wherever their lot may be cast, so long as they live. time We have not labored alone. The providence ofGod has gone before us, and by wonders and signs,which He has done in the midst of us, has He startledand awakened the hearts of the people, and madesignal demonstration of the awful criminality of thisland, which blasphemously styles itself a 'free' anda 'Christian' land. All the while that we havebeen laboring, and pleading the cause of those outragedmen and women, children of the One Father, whoare held by our God-defying laws and Constitution,all over this Union, as PROPERTY, Drayton and Sayreshave been lying in a wretched prison, in the city ofWashington, under the very caves of the buildingwhere the National Congress utters the will of all thepeople North and South, arraigned for the crime of goingto those who were 'sick and in prison,' and endeavoringto lead them' out of the house of bondage.'Their trial, in a court completely under slaveholdinginfluence, has been cruelly protracted, and still lingers.The nation's prisoners are they, suffering thusfor doing a deed which, if led to it by a humanemotive, (the absence of which we cannot suspect,)will bring upon their souls the approval of Heaven–which,indeed, already has brought the peace of Godinto their lonely cells. crime In the depth of the winter, there suddenly appearedamongst us William and Ellen Craft, two of those'persons' whom the State of Georgia is so base andrecreant as to consider 'chattels personal,' without aangle human right, bound to live, to labor, and todie for the sole use, convenience and profit of another.By a boldly conceived and admirably executed plan,availing themselves of the most frequented thoroughfares,and the most thronged means of conveyance, inthree or four days, their feet stood upon the soil ofPennsylvania. Even there, though comparativelysafe, they dared not be seen openly, but kept concealedin a friend's house, until they could free fartherNorth.

Since hisescape, others have attempted a similar experiment,but failed. How many thousands, and tens of thousands,have been likewise foiled in their schemes andefforts to obtain liberty, and been driven back to amore hopeless slavery than before, can never be knownon earth. Other incidents of interest in our workmight be mentioned, but already we encroach on timedue to a consideration of the present and the future. his contentment reluctance good The formation of the Free Soil party, an event ofno little interest, giving promise of so much andhitherto resulting in so little, took place, as is wellknown, during the last summer. The character, theclaims, and the aims of that party, were thoroughlyand ably discussed in our conventions. Opportunityof engaging in the disunion was at all times freelyoffered to the advocates of that party, and, in frequentinstances, accepted; and it cannot be questioned, thatmuch light was shed by these discussions upon thetrue character of the  party, the  ofthe work it proposed to self to do, and the probabilityof is  in my important particular on measure.

 The spring's scanted buds all around me are swelling;There are songs in the stream—there is health inthe gale;A sense of delight in each bosom is dwelling,As feat the pure daydreams o'er mountain and vale;The desolate reign of old winter in broken—Theverdure is fresh upon every tree;Of Nature's revived the charm, and a tokenOf love, O thou Spirit of Beauty, to thee!         The sun looketh forth from the halls of the morning,And flushes the clouds that begirt his career;He welcomes the gladness and glory, returningTo rest on the promise and hope of the year;He fills with delight all the balm-breathing flowers;He mounts to the senith, and laughs on the wave,He wakes into music the green forest-bowers,And gilds the gay plains which the broad riverslave.         The young bird is out on his delicate pinion—Hetimidly sails in the infinite sky;A greeting to May and her fairy dominionHe pours on the west-winds, that fragrantly sigh;Around and above there are quiet and pleasure—Thewoodlands are singing, the heaven is bright;The fields are unfolding their emerald treasure,And man's genial spirit is soaring in light.        Alas! for my weary and care-haunted bosom!The spells of the sprang-time arouse it no more;The song in the wild-wood, the sheen in the blossom,The fresh-swelling fountain—their magic is o'er!When I list to the stream, when I look on the flowers,They tell of the past with so mournful a tone,That I call up the throngs of my long-vanish'd hours,And sigh that their transports are over and gone.        From the far-spreading earth and the limitless heaven,There have vanished as eloquent glory and gleam:To my sad mind no more is the influence given,Which coloreth life with the hues of a dream;The bloomed-purple landscape its loveliness keepethI dream that a light as of old gilds the wave;But the eye of my spirit in weariness sleepeth,Or sees but my youth, and the visions its gave.        Yet it is not that age on my years hath descended—'Tis not that its snow-wreaths encircle my brow;But the newness end sweetness of being are ended—Ifeel not their love-kindling witchery now;The shadows of death o'er my path have been sweeping,There are those who have loved me debarr'd fromthe day,The green turf is bright where in peace they aresleeping,And on wings of remembrance my soul is away.          It is shut to the glow of this present existence—Ithears, from the Past, a funereal strain,And it eagerly turns to the high-seeming distance,Where the last blooms of earth will be garner'dagain;Where no mildew the soft damask-rose cheek shallnourish.Where grief bean no longer the poisonous sting;Where pitiless death no dark sceptre can flourish.Or stain with his blight the luxuriant spring.          It is thus that the hopes which to others are given,Fall cold on my heart in this rich month of May;I hear the clear anthems that ring thro' the heaven,I drink the bland sirs that enliven the day.And if gentle nature, her festival keeping,Delights not my bosom, ah! do not condemn;O'er the lost and the lovely my spirit is weeping,For my heart's fondest raptures are buried withthem.         

 The country has placed itself on a bad eminencebefore the world, for the multiplicity and a farepity ofthe mobe. An illegal outbreak against intolerable oppressionand  injustice inflicted on the part ofthe government, though attended with the sheddingof blood, is to be judged with leuiency, even by thespirits of Christian non-resistance; but when its objectsto pretest a tyrannical institution, or to destroythe equal rights of the citizens, or to put down theliberty of speech out of the press, or to gratify personalanimosity, it is purely detestable. The first riotof the long series that has been recorded within thelast twenty years, to the exceeding detriment of ournational character abroad, assured in the year 1833,in the city of New York; he last took place a fivedays since in the same city. The object of the firstwas, to seize and abuse the person (if not to take thelife) of he writer of this article, and to prevent theformation of a city anti-slavery society. It was instigatedby Southern slaveholders them in the city,and more or les encouraged by almost every one ofthe daily papers. The authorities allowed it to dowhatever in its diabolical hated of abolitionism itmight list. No effort was made by them to arrest anyof the rioters, or to preserve order. For the nextthree or four years, similar mobs to crush the risinganti-slavery spirit took place in swift succession allover the land, wherever an anti-slavery lecturer vesturedto address an assembly, or an abolition conventionwas held. In no instance, we believe, were thefriends of the slave protected in the exercise of thesenatural and constitutional rights by the civil authorities;on the contrary, they were handled over to the'tender mercies' of the mob with real fraternity offeeling and uncommon satisfaction. Happily, owingto the long suffering and patience of the abolitionists,not a single rioter lost his life, and none in their ranksfell, the Alton tragedy excepted.  The last riot in New York was a theatrical one, andattended with frightful seems of violence and bleed-shed.Not less than twenty persons were killed mortally wounded. Many others were shot, or otherwisebadly injured. We need not go into particularsof an event now so widely known, and so well understood.The outbreak was without excuse, withoutpalliation. Every one who countenanced it, directlyor indirectly, was a lawless person, and the enemy ofrepublican liberty. The attempt to throw the blastupon the highly respectable citizens, who solicited Mr.MALCEEDY, the eminent, English tragedian, to performat the Opera House, or upon the actor himself, is asdespicable as it is important. They had a right to extendsuch an invitation, and he to accept of it, withoutbeing accountable to any body or men. It wasthe sworn duty of the authorities to protect them inthe enjoyment of that right, at whatever sacrifice ofmobocratic life; and if they had not done so, theywould have been guilty of perjury, and of aiding isthe anarchical subversion of the government.

And why vainly,if not because it is in vain for men to keel with hollowofferings of compliment at her shrine, whilethemselves withhold from her the substance of recognizedhuman rights! Before she will bestir herself tothe great work, she needs such evidence of her fitness,from the deeds of man, as his many-times repeatedwords have hitherto proved entirely insufficientto afford her. deeds words It is not long since we felt, that no modern reformhad so little interest for us, as that in behalf of thecivil rights of women. Partly, because conductedwith little wisdom, it had made itself ridiculous, andso alienated our sympathies; partly, because so manyof the wrongs of the race seemed to have more pressingclaims; and partly, because of our confidence inits final and speedy accomplishment. Meanwhile,Providence carried us into the midst of poverty andsuffering, which seemed to be the direct result of thatunequal action of public opinion which denies to thetwo sexes the same privileges of education, and refusesto the married woman the right to hold property.Forced to reflect upon the subject, long anddeeply, our interest was quickened, and through manya dark and unaccountable experience of the past, aflood of light came pouring, which left us no longerin doubt as to the answer to many an anxious question. The recentness of our consideration of the subjectmay give a certain crudeness to our reflections, whichwe regret the more, because we are well aware that,to the suggestions which we have to offer, we shallnot carry the sympathies of many, who have hithertoaccompanied our every step with a hearty God-speed.But the time to offer s great truth is not when itwill be most welcome, but when we see that it is mostnecessary; and what could convince us of the presentgreat necessity of a candid, thoughtful and profoundconsideration of this great question, if not theuniversality of the interest in it? Discussions concerningit are no longer confined to 'fanatics, enthusiasts,and pestilent fellows,' to 'Quakeresses and madwomen who want room for their mischiefs,' but theyenter the family circle, they climb into the pulpit,they assail the hall of legislation itself. They are nolonger companions to the dreams of associationists, tothe compelled reveries of the deceived and the abandoned;but they make one of the most prominentpoints of the prose and poetry of our day. Theystare at us, with an almost brazen consciousness oftheir own impregnability, from the fascinating pagesof the ever-struggling George Sand, and they stealforth, unexpectedly enough, from the quietest cornersof the womanly narrative of the gentle, loving,well-balanced Frederika Bremer. Let us consider,then, what changes really need to be made, and beingmade, what their effect will be. And first, not one of us can doubt, that in as mach aswoman owes whatever advance she has hitherto made,beyond the condition of a slave, to the influence ofChristianity, and as this influence did more for her,in the first instance, than for man, so she owes a peculiardebt to her religion; and it is through her thatits highest principles, its ever unfolding truths, willfind the most effective advocacy. There are manypersons who believe that women will exert this advocacyto the greatest advantage, in the quiet circleof their homes, and that those who wish to movemore widely will do so, in spite of circumstances,through the press. This may be true of the exceptions,of those who, through uncommon soundness ofjudgment, or unusual strength of intellect, force theconfidence of those who surround them, and seizeupon the rights, which the average of public opinionstill withholds, but it will never be true of the mass.There are thousands, who can never be induced tobelieve that they possess power, or incur responsibility,until you give them some tangible proof of itThe more we reflect upon this, the more fully convinceddo we find ourselves, that this is the reasonwhy all past appeals to the moral sense of the sexhave been so far in vain. The question which mostdeeply interests us, at this moment is, simply, 'Whatcan be done for woman, to enhance her moral power,and bring it to bear most forcibly upon existing evils,namely, licentiousness, drunkenness, war, slavery,and unrighteous legislation?' We answer, in thewords of our dear Swedish friend—'Give her, in sociallife, her true position as human being, as fellow-citizen;then indeed may you look to see her the motherof a renewed and ennobled human race.' Andthe rights which, once granted, will secure her this'true position,' present themselves in three groups:The Educational, or those which are to fit her for theexercise of all others;—the Social, or those at presentwithheld from her, more by the influence of publicopinion, than by direct legislation;—and the Civil,or those which bestow the rights of relationship; whichenable her to hold and control property after her marriage,and change her from the passive subject of anyform of government, into its responsible upholder. The three-fold division will not be found philosophical,nor is it based upon so wide a knowledgeof actual legislation as we should be glad to have,but it is convenient and will sufficiently exhibit thetrain of our own thought. And first, What are the Educational rights of woman?We maintain, that they are those of all humanbeings; namely, that they have an especial right tobe taught all common blanches of education, addedto the thorough use of the needle, and any higherbranches for which they may evince either taste orinclination; that colleges, school of law, theologyand medicine, should be opened for them; and thatscientific collections, anatomical preparations, publiclibraries, and scares accumulations of records, MSS.and so forth, should afford them as easy  asthose of the other sex. We maintain, that man hasnever trodden any path which woman has not shownbefore him. We do not believe that the proportionsof the faculties are the same in the two cases, but webelieve that no faculty has over been developed inany man, which has not been, or might not be, equallydeveloped in some woman, and we believe suchdevelopment intended by God. When we iderthat the public education of every woman terminatesof an age which leaves man a more school-day, andthat what she afterwards learns must depend mainlyon her own resolution, we think the number of womento be found, presuming the , no inconditionablecredit to the intellectual rank of the per.No change of uniformity, on , is liking to bebrought against her, by any experienced mind.

The  of out on our faithfulness to the cause of . Of lateyears, pauperism has greatly increased in all our legislations.In the year 1843, we came into personal contractwith four hundred cases of pauperism in the onlyof Boston. Of these, we not hesitate to say, that onehalf might have been entirely prevented, and twothirds of the remainder greatly mitigated, by a bettereducation of the women forming heads of families.At least forty of these families might here been placedbeyond the need of mid, had the men, who shouldhave supported them, been early taught the  ofthe needle. It was by no slip of the pan, that weconcentrated this among the branches of education, towhich both sexes have a claim. For years, we haveregretted the little attention paid to it, in the publicschools of the city; and if we had health and power,we would press the matter day by day, and hour byhour, until we had created an interest in it. One ofour Ministers at Large has recently informed us, thatmany of the families assisted by him are partly supportedby the needlework of infirm or partially crippledman. In cases where the wife is forced to outdoorlabor, this acquisition becomes absolutely necessaryto the comfort of the husband. These arehours in all schools and families, when the children ofboth sexes will find the use of the needle a wholesomeand pleasant exercise.  proportions                                         both The Social Rights of women vary day by day, inconnection with an advancing public opinion. Theymust vary also with her educational advantages andher civil position. From the latter it is impossiblefully to separate them; and yet it will be seen thatthe law may withhold many privileges, which theaverage opinion of the better educated classes necessarilygrants, while opinion withholds many more,which the law does not deny. When righteousopinion pervades the masses also, her rights as a citizenand human being will be no longer questioned.But if her social position be in advance of that whichthe laws respecting her would lead us to think, it isby no means such as is to be desired. All humanbeings need, first, a development of their humanity;and if the men of our country were not as deeplyimmersed in stocks and markets as are women in theirhouseholds and pantries, they must have fort, are this,like the ancient Greeks, the need of more cultivatedand self-relying companions, and a clam like the ancientHeterm must have arisen among them.  The names of Aspasia, Lais, and Phryn&eacure;, offer nopleasant associations, perhaps, to the ordinary orprejudiced reader; but, naturally gifted, and possessedof fine acquisitions, the first men of their time eagerlysought their society, and the best scholars ofours assure us that there is room to question whetherthe bad repute they have enjoyed be not far morethe result of a mode of life unsuited to their era, andan intellectual apprehension and independence beyondthe sympathies of their sex, than of actual loosenessof conduct As it is, woman's social rights are limitedon all sides. A learned woman is looked uponwith suspicion, an independent one with disgust.Few modes of self support are open to the refined ofthe sex; and no matter how earnestly a family maycall upon her for their daily bread, to move in theslightest aside from the prescribed line of action, deprivesa mother of the power to procure it No honorableprofession but that of nursing or teaching isopen to her. So far is masculine ability prefaced tofeminine, that as a waiter at table or a servant in ahotel, she has not only the second chance, but thesmallest recompense. She does not stand upon herproper level even here; and unmanly as it is to cook,it is seldom that the conduct of a fashionable entertainmentis entrusted to her nicer tact. In almostevery act of life, her reputation needs the shelter ofmasculine guidance; and in a church meeting, socialclub, or public gathering of any sort, the sound ofher voice excites a start of surprise. A woman ofintelligence k not looked upon as a natural result;she is considered a phenomenon by those who mostadmire her. In the very attention she excites, isfound the best proof of the painful position of the sex.'If I thought' said an eminent clergyman to uslately,' that woman's silence on subjects of great importwere a matter of choice with her, I should notdeplore it. But it is not so; she struggles to speak,and the thought that she is a woman chokes her.'When her intellectual development becomes what itought, this thought will no longer oppress her. Noforce of habit will be so strong as the truth of Godpoured into her soul. She will speak without rememberingthat she is a woman, because she is a humanbeing. She will not pause for the inspiration of applause,for the power of God in her will brook nowaiting. At present should she speak out in public,no matter how necessary, how wise, how suitable herword or action, there are few so far free from prejudiceas not to accompany their words of praise withsome qualification rotating to her sex. In the timeof the great Dryden, sensual as it was, there was 'nosex in souls,' and until this truth is broadly accepted,every work of reform must stand still. here It is but a short time since woman left the socialboard at the hour when the wine-cup passed, underthe false courtesy that considered her honor thanman, and declared him unharmed by excesses or indecenciesthat she must blush to witness. But the advocatesof the temperance reform early discoveredthat her presence was needed to ensure their success,and they gave the example, widely followed, of publicdinners attended by both sexes. The consequenceis, that no refined man likes the imputation of havingremained at table after the ladies have left; and inmany circles, the practice is discontinued altogether.We risk nothing in adding, that that pastime must beunbecoming, and that occupation far from mealy, inwhich the presence of woman in found an uncomfortablerestraint. The last division of our subject the civil rights ofwoman, in fast embraces the whale question; forwhenever man is prepared to grant to her the rightsthat he accords to himself, as a human being, theywill, of course, embrace all educational and socialprivileges. It is not likely, however, that reform inthese last respects will wait until public feelingreaches the crisis necessary to the highest result.More and more freely, year by year, will men accordthese rights, and the rapid development of the feminineelement in society will open the eyes of the wholerace to the necessity of the final step. The great question of this, and perhaps the comingcentury, is that of Marriage, and the condition ofwomen in relation to it. Woman has passed our ofman. Her  is  to the laws which he, the institution he upholds, the religious andpolitical hierarchies which dominate ever him.

Several otherStates had out her the example, which Massachusettshas not yet Allowed!‡                   ‡ We do not like to approach that side of the matterwhich pertains to the political  of women. Weknow how the subject disgusts most men. We knewhow fend the  sex one of violate, and how theyfear lest the brush case out away-from about their favorites,they should turn to  peoples or goodytulips. Two objections  most than who discussthis subject at the outset. The utter incompatibilityof maternal and household cures with the excitementof political action. The other is the necessary absenceof that practical knowledge and wide intercoursewith men on the part of women, needful tothe right use of political power. But the question ofright is apart from the question of practicability. Weconfess that, as we look at them, these difficultiesseem to us real and oppressive; but let man take onestep toward the right, and God always shows himthereupon a second toward the practical. We neverfelt any inclination for this sphere of life. Thethought of it is almost hateful to a women's love oftruth. But ought it to be so? Ought one of the noblestprivileges of man to be unworthy of his sister orhis wife?     When woman is invested with civil power, one sideof human wrongs, hitherto unheeded, will find avoice. Moreover, the fact of her presence, in the hallof legislation, would have a tendency to check vulgarity,intemperance, and personal abuse. Wouldone man dare to strike another in her presence?Would ambitious politicians make war on unoffendingnations, for the sake of personal aggrandizement,if her voice opposed them? We believe not, and weno more believe that political life would degrade woman,that that her presence after the dessert has besottedher. Let her elevate political life as she hasspiritualized the pleasures of the table. We will notspeak further of the right as the impracticable. Weknow that to give woman her true position willoverturn many of our most cherished institutions,unsettle many of our accustomed promises. But theconfusion will not be so great as many fear, and outof it will arise a more beautiful order. Objections to this reform, on the ground of woman'swant of education and fitness, are precisely such asare made to the abolition of slavery. No slave canbe fitted for freedom before he is made free. Heneeds the consciousness of manhood, not otherwisereceived. We know vary well that were civil privilegesat once conferred on women, the ignorant, theshallow, the conceited and corrupt, would be the firstto rash into the arena, and exercise their new power.The conscientious, the true-hearted and the wise,would stand appalled for the moment before the vastresponsibility. Another question decides this. Havenot women actually exercised, in all countries and inall ages, a vast political influence?Ι We will not referyou to France, where women are educated tocomprehend external life, when at the close of theeighteenth century, Madame Roland, the daughter ofthe people, swayed the deliberations of its rulers, andexpiated the crime upon the scaffold; nor to England,where one intriguing woman has often controlledthe nation through many intriguing men; nor toItaly, where women have been seated in Professors'chairs, and taught politics and philosophy in a breath;nor to Alexandria, where Hypatia taught and wastorn in pieces by the rabble; nor to Russia, whereCatharine reigned alike a despot and a brute; but gorather to the head-quarters of our own federal governmentand you will find a degree of political powerexercised by corrupt woman, that we should blushto name. Would these women be any less fitted forsuch an exercise were it openly accorded them? Certainlynot; but the wisdom and goodness really dwellingin the sex would be brought to balance their intrigues.That women are neither slaves nor minors,the law shows when it taxes the property of the single.So inconsistent must laws ever be, when notbased on immutable right. Ι The great work of the coming time, then, is to organizethe rights of woman, as a step towards themore perfect organization of the rights of man. Regardingthe duration of the struggle, it were uselessto prophecy; for reforms are achieved nowadays in aspace of time that would have astonished our fathers.In such organization, when achieved, we see the fullfruition of every reform. Looking upon woman asthe grand agent of redemption, we fully believe thather first care, what power shall be entrusted to her,will be 'the greatest sufferer;' for 'A great soul is here, that dares to go inTo the prison, the slave-hut, the alleys of sin,And to bring into each, or to find there some lineOf the never completely oat-trampled Divine.'EAST NEEDMAN, Mass., April 31, 1849.
