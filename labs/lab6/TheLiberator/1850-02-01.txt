Men take the pure ideals of their souls.And look them fast away,And never dream that things so beautifulAre fit for every day!

 STRAMER GRMERN, Ohio River, TRAMER RMERN, January 11,  DEAR GAREISON: EAR AREISON: I came on board this steamer, on the 9th, so godown the river, so speed several weeks in Cincinnatiand vicinity. Six dollars for five hundred miles,and fed and lodged Suck are the distance and thefare from Pittsburgh to Cincinnati the usual fare isfive dollars and found. I do not believe that a rivercan be found on earth of the same length, thatgives such as inflate vacuity of beautiful acanery.It is eleven hundred miles form Pittsburgh to thejunction of the Ohio with the Miippi, and for overhalf that distance, there is scarcely a spot where youcan see two or three  ahead; such is the pentine course of the river, as it winds among thefertile and beautiful hills that like both its banks. Iwish I could give you a description of the salaam ofour steamer. If you would study man, traverse theseWestern rivers and lakes in steamers, as an advocateof anti-war, anti-slavery, teetotalism, and humanbrotherhood, and as the enemy of sectarianismsand nationalism.    I hare just been having a talk with several aboutDeath, as a means of prosecution to life liberty andproperty. I denied that man could rightfully inflictdeath on a fellow-being;" that any power in the universewas competent to impose an man an obligationto do so. At once the usual argument was advanced,God kills men therefore men may rightfully kill oneanother, when God commands them to" do it. Thewars and penal code of the Jawa. Were adda tojustify war and the death-penalty. I was remindedof the questions of 'Rhode, put to me a few weekssince, through the Liberator, and asked, all of whichmay be reduced to two, namely—Does God infectdeath on men? Does H.C.W. believe that the writersof the Bible were ever mistaken? God kills men  To the first, I would say, God never did and neverwill inflict death on men. Of course, I 'mean, bydeath," what is usually meant by it—not a passagefrom this to another state, in obedience to the lawsof life and health, but 'a change in violation of thoselaws and accompanied with. pain and anguish ofbody and mind. Life is the law; death is the violationof it. The design of God is to carry us. onward from this to another state, by. the agency offixed natural laws. In such a change, there wouldbe no suffering, no death: but higher-life and purerjoy It assumed that God sometimes sends tempests, floods, earthquakes, pestilence and wars, with, aview to kill men. That men are destroyed in thesevarious ways, none will deny; but that the responsibilityof. their death rests on God, or that. God insistsdeath on them, I deny. To attribute to Godwhat is seen and known to be the result of humanagency is. manifestly absurd. Men cut their neighbors' throats, and tear their wives and children topieces; and say God did it; a man inflicts death uponchildren because the father sinned; a tree or a thunderboltfalls on a man and kills him, a tempest or avolcano destroys whole towns and cities, and all thisdestruction of life is fathered upon God. Now forthe questions of Rhoda. Did God kill Annanias and Sapphirat No; theydied under a sense of the overwhelming horror atthe greatness of their crime. Men, women and childrenhave been known thus to Ml victims to-intenseexcitement of fear, and of other passions. A mandies as the result of remorse, or an awful terror ofthe wrath of Heaven;—he kills himself as really asif he had stabbed his own heart. Did God kill Annanias and Sapphirat Did God kill Herodt No; he died of a diseasebrought on by his own crimes. He killed himselfas really as if he had cut his own throat. He violatedthe laws of health, and died; and his deathwas attributed to God, as is his death who nowdies by cholera or consumption. There is nothing inthe accounts of these two cases which argues thatthere was any special interposition. Did God send the t she bears to tear forty-are childrento pieces for mocking Elisha No; it was nomore the word of God than is the death of any personwho is killed by a wild beast. Did God send the t she bears to tear forty-are childrento pieces for mocking Elisha  Did God ever send a food to destroy mend No; rainis under the direction of fixed laws, and it never didand never will rain, except In obedience to theselaws. Men axe often destroyed by storms, and sweptoff and drowned by Hoods; but storms and floods werenever sent for that purpose, I have merely expressed my. own opinion of the casesadduced. I shall not enter into any argumenttouching them, but answer these, and all supposed orreal cases, taken from the Bible and all other books,by asserting that God never inflicts death upon men.The theology which fathers upon God the diseaseand death of this world, makes him a monster of follyor malignity. God puts us under fixed, justlaws, and works out all his purposes touching ourphysical and social existence solely by the agency ofsuch Iaws; and if these laws, written by Him on ourphysical and social natures, were allowed to work outtheir designed results, they never would cause painof body or anguish' of mind to any human being.These laws are violated, and death ensues; and mencast all the blame on what they call God. God never inflicts death upon men. designed results, Does H.C.W. believe the Bible By which I suppose is meant, Does he believe God sanctioned and didall the writers of the Bible attribute to Him I No, is myanswer; simply because many things are attributedto Him. which are opposed to natural justice andequity. The God of Nature never required a manto violate one of the organic, constitutional laws underwhich he placed him. No heathen nation everattributed to the being it worshipped as God, deedsmore cruel, inhuman, and unjust than the writers ofthe Old Testament attribute to what they worshipas God. I believe the writers' of the Bible were mistakenwhen they attributed the wars and penal codeof the Jews to a God of justice and benevolence.While I can no mere disbelieve the spirit and fundamentalprinciples of the Christian religion than I candisbelieve my own existence, I can no more believethat the Author of my being ever sanctioned the warsand penal code of the Old Testament, than that Heapproves of theft, robbery, rapine and murder at thepresent day. Does H.C.W. believe the Bible Does he believe God sanctioned and didall the writers of the Bible attribute to Him To array God against Nature is to array Him againsthimself. They do this who plead His sanction forthe infliction of death upon man. When men saythe Bible sanctions any opinion or practice, theymean that God sanctions it. The question with meis, not what the Bible says, but what says the Authorof my being? Did He the Father of men, ever authorizehis children to war upon and kill one another?Humanity, Justice, Love, cry out against it. Ajust and loving Father, using His children as meansof mutual slaughter! Whoever says He ever did,whether he be of the past or present, I believe ho ismistaken. No matter who ho be; if a man comesforward, claiming to be sent and inspired of God, toteach men that God ever did, or can, sanction the inflictionof death on man by the hand of man, Ishall take the liberty to say to him of thou art mistaken;the Author of our being never sent thee onsuch n bloody errand. Let me say, in conclusion, I feel no interest in thediscussion of this question, except as it bears on humanlife and liberty, and other questions of Humanity.Show me the outrage on man which does notfind a refuge in the bosom of what is called GodThen, if I follow. it there, and attempt to drive itthence, I am considered an attempt An atheist letme be to that God who ever did or can require manto outrage the elements othis1 social nature by inflictingdeath upon his brother. I deny the existenceand authority of any such God. I must do it, or.  M.C. WRIGET. PENWARN, Sunday, Jun, 13 ENWARN, I landed here at midnight and in mud, on the nightOf the 11th.

H.C.W. THE PUBLIC EDUCATION OF THE Orationdelivered before the Onondaga Teachers Instituteat Syracuse, N.Y., on the 4th of October,1849. By THEODORR PARKER. Boston: WilliamCrosby and H.B.Nichols.  Washington street.Like  every thing from the pen of is authorThis address is a leaf from the free of Life. TheGood time coming' is approaching, When men, on anoccasion such as called this Oration forth, can uttersentiments as bold and truthful as the following retract,and be both approved and applauded by suchan association as the Onondaga Teachers' Institute:—P.P. HE UBLIC DUCATION OF THE HEODORR ARKER.   The Church has also certain specific faults of itsown. It teaches injustice by continually referringto the Might of God, not His Justice; to His abilityand will to damn mankind, not asking if He has theRight! It teaches, that in virtue of His. infinitepower, He is not amenable to infinite Justice, andto infinite Love. Thus, while the Sate teaches, inthe name of expediency and by practice,. that theStrong may properly be the tyrants of the. Weak,the mighty nation over the feeble, the strong raceover the inferior, that the government may dispensewith Right at home and abroad—the Church, astheory and in Christ's name, teaches that God mayrepudiate His own Justice and His own Love.The Churches have little love of Truth as such,only of its uses. It most be such a troth as theycan use for their purposes; canonized truth; truthlong known; that alone is acceptable and called'religious truth'; only that is 'of God'; all elseis 'profane and carnal' as the Reason which discoversit They represent the average intelligence ofsociety; hence, while keeping the old, they welcomenot the new. They promote only popular forms oftruth, popular in all Christendom, or in their specialsect. They lead in no intellectual- reforms; 'theyhinder the leaders. Negatively and positively, theyteach, that to believe what is clerically told you itthe name of Religion is better than free, impartialsearch after the Troth.; They dishonor free thinking.and venerate constrained believing. When the clergydoubt, they seldom give men audience of theirdoubt Few scientific men not clerical believe theBible account of creation,—the universe made in sixdays, and but a few thousand years ago,—or that ofthe formation of woman, or of the del age. Someclerical, men still believe these venerable traditions,spite of the science of the times; but the clericalmen who have no faith in these stories not only leavethe people to think them true and miraculouslytaught, but encourage men in the belief, and calumniatethe men of science who look the universefairly in the face, and report the facts as they findthem. The Church represents only mo popular not any high and aboriginal virtue. It representsnot the conscience of human nature, reflecting theuniversal and unchangeable moral laws of God,touched and beautified by His love, but only the conscienceof human history, reflecting the circumstancesman has passed by, and the institutions he hasbuilt along the stream of time. So, while it denouncesunpopular sins, vices below the average vice ofSociety, it denounces also unpopular excellence,which is above the average virtue of Society. Itblocks the wheels rearward, and the car of Humanitydoes not roll downhill; but it blocks themforward also. No great moral movement of the ageis at all dependent directly on the Church for itsbirth; very little for its development It is in spiteof the Church that reforms go forward; it holds thecurb to check more than the rein to guide. In Morale,as in Science, the Church is on the anti-liberalside, afraid of progress, against movement, loving yeta little Bleep, a little slumber;' conservative andchilling, like ice, not creative, nor even quickening,as water. It doffs to use and wont; has small confidencein Human Nature, much in a few facts of HumanHistory. It aims to separate Piety from Goodness,her natural and heaven-appointed spouse, andmarry her to Bigotry, in joyless and unprofitablewedlock. The Church does not lead men to thedeep springs of Human Nature, fed ever from the farheights of the Divine Nature, whence flows thatriver of God, full of living water, where weary soulsmay drink perennial supply. While it keeps us fromfalling back, it does little directly to advance mankind.In common with the State, this Priest andLevite pass by on the other side of the least developedclasses of Society, leaving the slave, the pauper,and the criminal to their fate,, hastening to strikehands with the thriving or the rich.  

 In the U.S. House of Representatives, the otherday, Mr. Scheck, of Ohio, in a speech in defense ofMr. Winthrop and the Whig party, and animadvertingon the course pursued by Mr. Giddings and hisassociates, said— My colleague, and his little company of Purists,have not been alone in their position as disorganizesand impracticable. Fanaticism and intolerancehave not been confined to the North. We have hadflinations about disunion here, also, from theSouthern sky. Some honorable gentlemen, fromcertain of the slate States, have found occasion,because their demand for pledges, in advance, as tothe course of legislation, could not be gratified, tomake this hall resound with menaces and warnings.I was sorry to hear distinguished gentlemen declare,that they had rather put an end to this Union thanto have what they choose to consider the present,condition of things continue. But I have not beenalarmed it such threats. Precedent for speechesof that sort may be found else where; proving nothing,however, but the truth of the old adage, that'extremes meet'. I will read, for example, from onewhich I have now in my hand. Hear this orator ofanother arena:  We confess that we intend to example under foot theConstitution of this country; we call upon you to dolike wise. Shell I tell you why; you can never makea revolution in this matter, until you unmake the commonsense and the consciences of the people superiorto their statute books; until you arraign against thedepiction of the majority, the conscientious convictionsof the mass of the minority, whatever it be.' Do gentlemen around recognize that language?Can they tell from what latitude, from which sideof mason and Dixon's line, it comes? Does it notwound very like something we listened to lately,mired in eloquent and impassioned words fromGeorgia? Is not that denunciation of the despot ionof the majority over the minority, which must beresisted, almost identical with what was declared byan honorable member from Alabama? But let usread further: Daniel Webster says, you bare a law-abiding people;that the glory of New England is, that it is alaw attuning community. Shame on it, if this betrue; if even the religion of New England sinks aslaw as its statute book. But I say, we are not a landingcommunity. God be thanked for it!' we are not a landingcommunity. God be thanked for it That is the error of American politics. We haveforced the Democratize party out of the field, theoriginal ally of the slave power. We have sent the Whigsinto an alliance with Southern slaveholders. It isa natural alliance. It is the Lords of the lash andthe Lords of the loom associated. It is the capitalof the country and the conservatism of the countryagainst the ideas of the country.' A, sir, that allusion to New England betrays thelocality, which but for that it might have been difficultto determine. These extracts are from thespeech of Mr. Wendell Phillips, of Boston, made atan anti-slavery meeting held in that cite one day lastMay; and the account I have of the proceedingsthere, termites a series of resolutions to 'match'.Does not this sound very much like nullification? Mr. Giddings inquired, if the gentleman calledMr. Phillips free Soiled? Mr. Scheck—I have supposed he was. He isperhaps what is called in Massachusetts 'aconscience Whig,; at least, he belongs to the categoryof those men who require the majority to come tothe minority, and who require the majority to come to the minority,and who declare, if they do not, 'Letdisunion come, and disorder reign forever!' TheWhig party are charged by this Mr. Phillips asbelonging to the 'conservation of the country.' Sir, Iaccept the epithet; it is not odious to me. Let usbe the conservatives of the country. Coming fromthe North and the South, representing every sectionalinterest, but with a wise and honest toleration ofthese differences, let us act together for the generalgood, and for the maintenance of the just rights ofthe whole. Let us stand firmly in defense of theUnion, come the assault from whatever direction itmay. I, for one, as far as my feeble power may go,declare it to be my determination to be ever readyto maintain these common rights and common interests,here and elsewhere, as citizen and a representative,wherever my hand, or my voice, or my votecan do it, against all impractical men, disorganizesor disunions, whether they be of the Northor the South. The only good thing in Mr. Schenck's haranguewas the extract he read from the more than patriotic,the morally sublime speech of Wendell Phillips. 

 The Choctaw missionaries do not deny that forthirty years they have freely admitted slaveholders tothe churches; that the Christian Choctaw is just asdetermined a slaveholder as the heathen Choctaw;that slavery has advanced in the Choctaw nation paripu with Christianity. They do not claim thatany individual among the Choctaws was ever rejectedfrom the church, or disciplined, however decidedor persevering he may have been in compelling hisslaves to work without wages. But, in answer to theremonstrances of Northern Christians, they say, wehave ever guided ourselves by 'two fundamentalprinciples': The Choctaw missionaries do not deny that forthirty years paripu  '1st, The ordinance of baptism and the lord'ssupper cannot be scripturally and rightfully deniedto those who give credible1 evidence of piety, 2d. The missionaries, in connection with thechurches they have gathered, are to be the solejudges of the sufficiency of this evidence. But what an evasion of the true issue!! The missionarieswere never requested to deny the ordinancesof the gospel. those who were Christians.Our ground of complaints, that the fact of being aslaveholder is not considered as having any bearingon the evidence of personal religion. We ask themissionary to regard the act of holding a slave—whichis a deed of prima facie atrocity—as primafacie evidence against a man's piety. We ask him,when the slaveholder presents "himself for admissionto the church, to make that fact of slaveholding—whichis itself an act of oppression and wrong-doingtowards a maw—an objection to his being received,until he can prove that in his individual case suchslaveholding is unavoidable, and right, This weclaim. The reply is, 'We only admit to the churchthose who, we think, give credible evidence of piety.'The complaint is, that they think the inexorableand indiscriminate slaveholder does give-credibleevidence of piety; that their standard of piety isso low, that one who boa on him the prima facie evidenceof participating in atrocious oppression, is receivedas actually having such credible evidence. primafacie prove prima facie If then it be replied, 'The missionaries must actaccording to their-own judgment,'—most certainlyBut if their judgment embraces within its evidencesof credible piety, deliberate, willful, protracted slave-holdingwithout hint or design of ever relinquishingthis stern gripe on their neighbor's wages, and labor,and rights—then as certainly we may act according to can judgment in judging such unfit to he sustained.

 But act from a recent speech of 'hangman Foote,'of Mississippi, in the U.S. Senator:— The South would not probably have assumed itspresent position, if it had not been for the course ofa Southern man, (Mr. Benton,) living in a SouthernState, a slaveholder, and representing slaveholders,who had undertake to call all those who differ fromhim upon the agitating question, fools. That individualhad declared, that no man of sense now questionedthe right of Congress to legislate on the questionedthe roof slavery. When he made that declaration,he knew that the distinguished Senator from SouthCarolina, (Mr. Calhoun,) who was generally allowedto possess at least an ordinary share of intelligence,and the Senator from Michigan, 9Mr. case,) whopossess at least as much common sense as thegentleman who had inferred his lack of understandinghad, both of them, declared specifically thatthey could find no clause in the Congress. Heknew, also, that a large number of gentlemenassembled in this capital last winter had declared theirsolemn conviction, that no such right pertained toCongress. Notwithstanding all this, this Patter Senknown for his wisdom, experience, and a thousandvirtues besides, took it upon himself to declarethat all the gentlemen were falls; and similar actshad created the necessity upon the part of the Southfor action, asserting their rights and expressing theirconvictions of the power of Congress, and the positionwhich the Representative should assume onthis great question. Mr. Foote repeated his statementof the remarks made by the Senator, (Mr. Benton,)and said that the effect of such sentiments,arrowed in a Southern Satiate (Missouri) by a slaveholderhimself, had the effect of inducing the slavesto run off by fifties across the Mississippi River intothe free States. [Mr. Benton here rose, put on his hat,and throwing his cloak on his arm, proceeded toleave the chamber. As he was leaving, Mr. Footeproceeded,] Yes, sir, they fled across the river, thesame sort of flight the Senator is himself makingfrom the Chamber. I like to see a heroic Senator,one who dares to stand up and answer for his course,whatever it may time, when three thousand miles off,slandered and vilified his fellow Senators, and theportion of the Union which they represented, andthreatened to chastise those who differed from himon that subject was hinted at here, where he had fled from thehad slandered, face to face— that as soon as the subjectwas hinted at here, where he had proposed toadminister the chastisement, he had fled from theSenate as those negroes had flood across the river.Mr. Foote regretted the Senator had fled the ;he though if present, he could apply to him aclassical quotation, which might not be perfectible inhis absence. He would have enquired of him, in thelanguage of Cicero, 'Que tandem abusers Celina,pathetic na.   Que tandem abusers Celina,pathetic na.   he desired also to say, that the little demagoguesof the North—the butterflies of an hour, who liveonly until the first frost of the morning falls uponthem — would never have been able to effect anything, habit hot been for the aid which theyreceived from the South— form a Southern man—aslave bolder, as he had already stated. Under allthese circumstances, he could not offer any compromise,or any proposition designed as such. If anyscheme of compromise on this subject should beoffered in good faith, from the proper quarter, by theright king of men, he had no doubt that the Southwould readily agree to it. But it was not for theSouth now to offer such a proposition, and it was inthat view that he could not nave introduced such abill as that by the Senator from Missouri, whichproposed to open the question of slavery again in aTerritory where it was already recognized by theUnited States, and thus keep alive the flame ofdiscord, and add to the incendiary material already soplentiful. Mr. Foote also alluded to the Memorial presentedby the Senator from Missouri, at the last session,from a so-called convention of a government forthem, and the exclusion of slavery there from. Hethen pronounced the Memorial a fraud, intended tocheat a portion of the people out of their rights.Since that time, he had had a very extensivecorrespondence with the citizens of New Mexico, and theuniversal answer to his inquiries was, that he wasright in pronouncing the memorial a fraud, and thatthe Senator presenting it could not find a singlerespectable citizen of that territory, who would saythat it had ever emanated from a bona find Conventionof the people of New Mexico. He complimentedthe people of Deserter for coming forwardand asking the establishment of a government, anddeclaring at the same time that they wanted no partor lot in this question, which had endangered thepeace and harmony of the Union. a bona find This Foote is the jack all of John C. Calhoun, andfitly represents his infamous State. 

 AREY KELLEY FOTER, in a letter to the AntiSlavery Standard, demigod to arouse the A jets of New York to the Syracuse Correction makes the following timely remarks,which cannot be too earnestly pondered byAbolitionists throughout the country:— REY ELLEY OTER,   Allow me a suggestion torching a matter of thegreatest moment, but which is too often entirelyoverlooked. I refer to the sever labor necessary tobe perforated before Slavery can be abolished. Ifear most Abolitionists have not given this subjectdue deliberation. Instead of sitting down and countingthe cost before we entered upon this warfare werushed headlong into it, thinking Slavery would fullin a day but the days of  are post, andwhatever of geed we  For ourselves of forother, in there letter times, ceases of close and unremitting industry. Had the Abolitionistswho composed the American Anti-Slavery Societyat the outset, duly considered the character andstrength of the enemy they were marshaled to assail, many of them would never have enlisted to assail, many of them would never have enlisted to sufferthe mortification of being compelled, for lock ofmoral courage and Christian principle, to desert ourranks and join out enemies. Others, whom thesedeserters drew off with them, would never have beendeluded into the folly of attempting to drive from thecountry through the narrow aperture of the ballot boxa system of oppression which had acceded itthrough the broad aisle of the church, and still heldundisputed sway in the pulpit.    But what ii the work which must be done or Slaverybe left to curse our children as our fathers leftit to cane us? If-we can see how Slavery existewe can easily see how it can be destroyed Dees itderive its life from compacts and statutes on predicamentand paper? These are-hat the signs of things,Is it, because of the character of legislative, executiveand judicial "offices? These too we know to beonly the supple tools of an overruling power.'Where then resides the living spirit of Slaverythat gives up- three-millions of our countrymen,: for aprey? Is it not in the hearts of the American peoplewho have, from their infancy, drank in at everybreath, contempt and hatred of the slave and admirationand affection for the slaveholder? Has not theterm negro been but another name for meannessand brutality? And has not stakeholder beenbut another name for bravery, magnanimity and wisdom?Can we expect the people of the North willever put away Slavery till they shall, change theirestimate, of its character? And now shall they bebrought to hate and loathe it? Only by having itkept constantly before them painted in its true colors.But who shall do this?—we knew the church neverWill. She is 'given ores be reprobate mind and leftto believe a lie, and her damnation is sealed.' Fromthe, nature of political parties they never can do it.Their mission is to take the world as it is, arid notto make it what it should be. negro It is left then to the Abolitionists to do this giganticwork. It is theirs not only to make the peoplesee but to make them feel that Slavery being thegreatest of sins, the slaveholder, must necessarily bethe foulest and blackest of sinners. And in orderto accomplish this, teachers of moral science, mustbe sent into every city, town, village and school districtin the North.

It can't be done, however, at least inany way that they have tried.

 Reported for the Syracuse Journal. OF THE ABOLITIONISTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,AT CITY HALL, JAN. 15, 1850. At half past 10 o'clock, Rev. Samuel J. May calledthe convention to order, and for the purpose of temporaryorganization, moved that Joseph C. Hathaway,of Ontario, be temporary Chairman, and that Mr. A.Prune, of Onondaga, be Secretary. the chair named the following committee:—Messrs.J. Thomas, C.A. Wheaton, of Onondaga,Stephen S. Foster, of Massachusetts, Slocum Howland,of Cayuga, and Charles C. Burleigh, of Connecticut. The Committee retired, and during their absence,Rev. Mr. May read the Call of the Convention. Mr. May went on to comment upon the object ofthe Convention. It was to examine and discuss thehighest anti- slavery thoughts and views that had everbeen offered by any one, and see how far they oughtto govern us in our action as citizen. The Convention,from the terms of its Call, and from thecooperation of the various shades of opinion in promulgatingit, was to be regarded as open to all who wereat heart enlisted in the cause of the slave.The chairman would take this occasion to say,that free discussion was not only tolerated in thisConvention, but invited. Remarks from any one,giving their views, be they what they may, weredesired. The Committee on officers, &c., made the followingReport: President— SAMUEL, J. MAY. President Vice Presidents— Frederick Douglass andJoseph C. Hathaway. Vice Presidents Secretaries— J.W. RANDOLPH, CHARLSE. ADAMS. Secretaries Business Committee— CHARELES C. Burleigh,S.H. Gay, FREDERICK DOUGLESS, SLOCCM HOWLAND,ABIGAIL MOTT. Finance Committee— T.G. WHITE, ALANSONTHORP, GEO.W. DEAN. On motion, the Report was obliged for the complimentof the Convention. The majority of the Complimentedon officers were of those opposed to the menwho called the Convention. The majority of theofficers elected were of those who called theConvention. Resolutions embodying their opinions willbe brought forward; but they can be rejected orapproved, as the Convention shall see fit. The Committee on by – laws have made no restrictionas to time in sneaking the number of times, &c.here restrictions have always embarrassed discussions;and often the finest flow of thought, sheddinglight all around, was cut off by this rule. It wouldof course be borne in mind by the members, thatdud courtesy of each member to all the others, inthis particular, must be observed. We ask the fullest consideration and the freestspeech, upon all questions. we trust the Conventionwill be courteous, kind, free, earnest and candidon all questions, and will be quickening to us all. The PRESIDENT— in reply to Mr. frank, ofSyracuse— said that any gentleman was at liberty, atany time, to offer any resolution or proposition for theconsideration of the Convention. C.C. Burleigh, from the Business Committee,reported a series of resolutions. Report accepted. on motion, the first four of the series were takenup, as the first business of the Convention — asfollows: 1. resolved, That, in comparing the present stateof public sentiment and action, on the subject ofslavery, with the past, we see abundant evidence ofthe power of truth, and feel ourselves admonishedand encouraged to be more steadfast and unyieldingin our advocacy of the Right of Mass — aboundingmore and more in the work of the Lord, knowingfrom what has been done, that our labor is not in vainthe Lord. 2. Resolved, that the great change which hasalready been wrought in the land, is plainly attributableto that dreamingly insignificant, beginning,which a few years ago (according to the then Mayorof Boston) was all that could be found of Abolition ion,in a small, obscure apartment, in an upper acorn,by one W.L.G., and a black boy. 3. Received, that the words of truth thereuttered have, as good seed, produced abundantly, fromyear to year, bringing forth seed after their kind,which, borne every where on newspaper wings,far and wide by the wined of controversy, andploughed is by every state of this wide- speakUnion, and are bringing forth in some thirty, in somesixty, and in some a hundred fold.  4. Resolved, That the prediction uttered from thatlittle 'upper room,' in Boston, in 1891, by WilliamL.G—, that the 'foot of the young liberatorshould make the nation tremble to its centre,' hasbeen already fulfilled. The PRESIDENT, in reading these resolutions,remarked that the 'upper room' referred to in thesecond resolution was the steer of Mr. Otis, thenMayor of Boston. The Governor of Virginia wroteto him that an opposition to southern 'institutions'was organizing in Boston. Mayor Otis replied, thatafter diligent search, the only evidence he could findof such intent, consisted in the operations of WilliamL. Garrison and a black boy, in a small room inan upper story. In 1831, Garrison was publishing thaw Liberator,a paper insignificant in size, and in reply to thesneers of other papers as to his labors. he utteredthe memorable declaration quoted in the fourth resolution,and which has already been so signally fulfilled. On motion, J.W. Logan and M. Merrick wereappointed &Committee on Enrolment. Adjourned to half past one. FIRST DAY— AFTEHNOON SESSION. the Convention was well attended. The President announced that the first four resolutionswere under consideration, as the first businessof the Convention. Mr. C.C. BURLEIGH remarked upon theencouragement for future and increased effort in timesto come, which could be derived from the history ofthe past. men who were climbing slippery acclivitieswere benefited by pausing, and surveying theground that had been traversed. If he, in thisretrospect, discovers evidence that he has overcomeobstacles, and considering what has been done, hasadvanced with an encouraging rapidity, he hasrenewed reason for greater effort. We have beenascending this steep acclivity for twenty years. Mr.B. went on in a highly wrought and forcible descriptionof the work of the abolitionists, and said thatthey might well say that 'hitherto the Lord hathhelped us.' No other strength but His could haveborne us up so far; could have enabled us to meet thepersecutions, obloquy, and discouragements and dangerswhich thickly thronged our way, when first weturned our faces toward the goal, which brightensevery day, the nearer we approach it. Who doesnot remember the feebleness, the lowliness of thisenterprise, which now shakes the nation? The forceof this sentiment is felt in the cabinet, in the councilsof the nation, in the family circle — everywhere our country, Mr. Gonium, and eloquentlypersonated the contempt expressed by the pulped May ofof Boston, as indicated in the resolutions. Hedescribed Mr. G. as a printer's boy, scarce in his majority,without the aid of family or fortune, as theinstrument to bring slavery to a account a the bar ofGod — and anticipating the final decision, to bring itbefore the nation. it went out as a still small voice— to be echoed back at first by mobocracy, but soonto come back from the pine woods of Maine, fromthe bayous of the Mississippi, and from the Ridgeyshores of the Pacific. We know we shall triumph.we are not dealing in abstractions or scorpions.We are dealing in abstractions or scorpions.We are dealing in self- evident truths; in thosesentiments of love and goodness which are to redeemthe world. We are mighty, because w throw our selvesin the cause which is to move the world.Nothing can stand against us. this is the reasonwhy the young printer could speak in a tone sopositive, so unfaltering, as was used by him when standingthus unaided and alone. We were told the other day, in this hall,(by Prof.Hopkins,) that knowledge is power — and it wasillustrated by the rule we have obtained over thematerial world. It is, that he who acts inharmony with the Divine will has an equally mightymoral power, one which astonishes credulity it self,and out- wonders the miracles of antiquity. Hehas control over a mightier and higher nature, thanhe we touches the keys of the Magnetic Telegraph. What was it fifteen or a fanatic and an enthusiast—tobe an object of scorn, contempt, hatred andpersecution; and to be fortunate, indeed, if heescaped with only the loss of his properly, and not tobe dragged through the streets, with a rope aroundhis body, then to be cast in to prison. the pioneersdid not foresee all they were to encounter— and itwas perhaps well they did not. They supposed they wouldget help from the strong and influential— butin this they soon found their mistake. but theywent on, subduing every where. The vast majority of northern politicians are nowcontending as to who is beast entitled to the appellationof hostility to slavery. We have not convertedthem; but have demonstrated the homage whichvice ever pays to virtue, by compelling them to assumethe garb of hypocrisy. We may not trustthem, but we may take courage, when it comes tobe policy for such men to assume our principles. beast you see how it is in the political world. A fewyears ago, if the question had been raised, whetherslavery should exist in new territory, it would havebeen mot with scorn and contempt. who opposedthe annexation of Arkansas or of Florida as a slaveState? Mr. B. went on to say, that when he first wentto Pennsylvania, the abolitionists could not havethe hall of the Legislature to meet in; but before heleft the state, by the unanimous vote of both Houses,it was voted that the jails of Pennsylvanianshould not longer be the warehouse of the slaveholders. When he went to Ohio, ten years ago, the 'blackcode' of that State provided that a colored mancould not be a witness; should be taxed for theschool system, but should not enjoy its benefits;and the two political parties vied with each other injustifying three outrages; but that 'code' has vanished. In Massachusetts, when he first went there, thevoice of the cannon or abolitionism; and the Governorintimated that abolitionism was a crime whichcould be prosecuted at common law; and if not, theLegislature could supply the deficiency. Ten or twelve years ago, every Democratic andWhig candidate took the utmost points to convey theidea that he was not tinctured with abolitionism.Yet in 1848 and 1849, all were attempting to makethe people believe that they were through going intheir hostility to slavery. He referred to the courseof Thaddeus Stevens, of Pennsylvania, as anillustration; at the same time insisting that he wasinconsistent in supporting Gen. Taylor for thepresidency. He had designed to show some might of progress inthe religious world; for public action and neutralityare now as far apart, that although the one might besick of the worst discusses, the other might present aclean bill of health! Although it might seem abrupt,he would here yield the floor.Mr. S.S. FOSTER covered the adoption of theresolution. There was much important business todo. Principles were to be discussed and settled. Itwas necessary to discuss the principles of the AmericanAnti- Slavery Society; for only by discussioncould why thing be conceived. There were oppositions ofthis flossiest were, and he was rejoicedto see them here to discuss there principles face tofacer. He was sure this Convention would be anoccasion of triumph to that society; for he wasconvinced it was correct. The word 'Liberty 'is hardlyhear ad from one week's end to another in the easternpart of the State. nothing is done. I do not carewhat measures are adopted, if they are right ones. Ihave no condense in compromises; they have beenthe curses of many friends of the slave, thinking theycould make something in a bargain with the devil.Business first, then talking, visiting, please men. He concluded with a motion to take the question.Seconded. Mr. PILLISHURY would dwell upon the idea ofMr. Burleigh and the President, that the anti- slaverymovement in prominently a religion movement.Nothing but the strongest religious faithcould have sustained us in our labors. And it sustainsall who engage in great enterprises — great,because they are good. He referred to the futileat temple to settle New England on selfish principles;but the attempt was pre-eminently successful in thehands of men of fine and unshaken with, like thePuritans. So of the anti-slavery movement. Itought to be understood that the principles of theabolitionists appeal to the best affliction of the heartand soul; and no one can be a pure abolitionist whois not devoted heart and soil to the cause of truth.Thus regenerate, he is ready for the work. ILLISHURY The resolution under discussion were again read,and unanimously adopted. unanimously adopted. The PRESOLUTIONS then read the balance of theReport of the business Committee, as follow:— 5. resolved, That the action of the government ofthe united States has from the first been embarrassedby that greatest of all incongruities in a DemocraticRepublic, the institution of slavery. And thatthe government has been kept in operation only bythe aid of Northern compromises. Their oil is nowwell-high dried up the heat of anti-slavery truth,and the question for the people to determine is,whether the oil of compromise shall be replenished,or that slavery, the great cause of that friction whichimpedes the free. Consistent, happy operation of ourgovernment, shall be utterly revolved. 6. Resolved, that the actual stand-still to whichthe machinery of our government was brought forweeks at the opening of the present session of Congress,by a little dust, a little 'free soil,' that are longstop entirely, unless slavery or freedom gives up theconflict. 7. Resolved, That it had been far better for thewelfare and honor of our country, if the House ofRepresentatives had never been able to organizeit self, than it should do so by a portion of thenorthern members yielding to the demands of theabettors of slavery; for that no action of ourCongress can be for the good, much less the glory ofour Republic, which commences in compromise ofRight. 8. Resolved, That inasmuch as the slaveholderhas no right to keep his slaves in bondage, andtherefore, that the slave has a right to escape tofreedom; and we have, consequently, no right tohinder him from doing so, or to help to take andenslave him; and as we have no right to makepromises which cannot rightfully be obeyed, it followsthat the provision of the American Constitution,which requires the giving up of the runner way to hismaster, ought never to have been adopted, and oughtnot now to be obeyed; nor have we any freight topromise obedience to it. 9. Resolved, therefore, That we hereby repeatthe announcement of our fixed purpose never to aidin the re-capture and re-installment of the escapingbondman, nor to promise support or obedience to theConstitution, while it retains the provision alluded to;but will always, to thaw best of our ability, as opportunityoffers, help the fugitive to gain and keep thatpriceless blessing which he seeks, and to which hehas an inalienable birth-right. 10. Resolved, that we have no right to side orpromise to aid in putting down, by bloody violence,an insurrection of the slaves for freedom, because, ifit be right to fight in defense of our most sacred andprecious rights, the slaves would be right in such aninsurrection, and of course to fight against themwould be wrong; but if, on the other hand, it bewrong to fight in defense of our own rights, stillmore must it be wrong to fight against the no lesssacred and precious rights of other men. right wrong 11. Resolved, that while the Constitution requiresus to go, 'at the bidding of any slave State, and suppressby force any effort of the slaves to will libertyby violence, we have no right to promise, and willnot promise support and obedience to that Constitution. 12. Resolved, That as we have no right to grantpeculiar privileges to evil doers on account of theirevil-doing, and in proportion to its extent, we cannotrightfully invent the slaveholder with politicalpower in proportion to the number of his slaves; andtherefore we cannot rightfully sustain, or promise tosustain, the Constitution, while it gives the slaveStates a representation in Congress for three-fifthsof the slaves. 13. Resolved, that if each individual is morallybound to refuse his help to the recapture of runwaysfrom slavery, and to the forcible suppressionof slave insurrections for freedom, and to the givingof polities power to the whole community, made up ofthese individuals, is equally bound to take the same position. 14. Resolved, That to take this position is torenounce allegiance to the Constitution, to with drawfrom the present existing American Union with Slaveholders. Mr. PILLSBURY remarked that he was highlypleased with the resolutions of the Committee, butshould read his resolution, as a conclusion of thewhole matter. It was as follows: Resolved, that among all the agencies andinstrumentalities whose professed object is the overthrowof slavery, none has entitled it self to the fullco-operation and support of the people, but the AmericanAnti-Slavery Society, and its organized or individualauxiliaries. None other can claim to bebased upon immutable principles. None other hasmaintained inviolate even the principles on which itset out; and none other stands out to-day before theworld clear in its doctrines as the sun, fair in its fidelityto those doctrines as the moon, and terrible in itsrighteous demands upon, and rebukes of the tyrantas an any with banners. And as such, it, and itonly, is worth the regard, the cordial sympathy andsupport of every lover of Humanity and Man. Mr. FOSTER. moved that this resolution be takenup for discussion. He liked it better, for it coveredthe whole ground. To his mind, all who arefriends to the slave ought to a green in the support ofthis Society, on this principle, that the great worktube done was to revolutionize public sentiment bythe power of truth. If the proposition of the resolutionbe true, we are agreed. It was dle, at thehonest, to settle this question. He desired to hear thereasons why all did not support the Society; hewanted they should convert him to their views, orelse be converted to his own.  Mr. THOMAS moved that the discussion of thequestion between the anti- Slavery party and theLiberty Party open At the commandment of thesection, The Liberty Party would be represented bytheir champion, Garret Banish, and the other reanimationmay be represented by whoever theychoose. They have throw down the challenge; wescoped it. He derived to have all thing done withfairness and order. Mr. REMOND hoped the amendment ofMr. Thomas would not prepaid. if this is the questionof question, so far as this Correction is conserved,it ought to be first on the list, or we will be liable tolone proctors time. I do not subscribed on this oneside, or question the other. He was opposed tohaving chosen champions to discuss the question. Mr. FOSTER rapeseed his ides, that the firstquestion was, 'the integrity of the American Anti-Slaverysociety' — whether it was the true anti- slavevery instrumentality. He were on to remark, thatit was not proper to indicate champions. He didnot like championship— it was a good word forpartisans; for those who represent others; but no mancould represent him. He had objections to the FreeSoil Party, the Liberty Party, the Democratic andthe Whig Party. Mr. BURLEIGH said every man should come forwardas his own champion. There were probably ahundred here who on some points different. He wasin favor of discussing monument this evening, and theConstitutional question to-narrow. Mr. WARD remarked that the fan had over thematter of championship was all very well, and woulddo then good. It was merely prospered, on the partof the Liberty Party, that Mr. Swath should asrosette their views. the friends of the Anti-SlaverySociety would conduct it as they should was it. Mr. GERRIT SMITH would say single word.He was opposed to the American Anti-Slavery Society,for that Society hold to the opinion that theAmerican Constitution was a pro-slavery instrumentHence a discussion by him of the resolution offeredby Mr. Pillsbury would involve the discussion of theconstitutional question; and that he should certainlyprefer to discuss to-morrow. There were topicsenough for to-night; he would like to hear manygentlemen open the sham churches of America;there were topics to occupy our attention thisevening. Mr. FOSTER said the wishes of Mr. snitch, tenthis particular, were his wishes. It was finally a greed, that the various topics in theresolutions, not embracing the constitutional question,should be taken up this evening. Adjourned to 6 1-2 o'clock. FIRST DAY — EVENING SESSION. The President read the balance of the Report of theBusiness Committee, and also the resolutionoffered by Mr. Pillsbury, and asked for the order of theConvention. Mr. BURLEIGH moved that the Convention takeup the 6th and 7th resolutions. Mr. B. said he would also read the followingresolution, handed to the Business Committee, and moveits adoption:— Resolved, That we cannot look towards the apicalof our country without saving these two aceincarcerated in the United States Courts, for having donewhat every lover of liberty and humanity angst to dowhenever opportunity offers, to wit, helped a numberof fellow- men in their endeavor to escape fromslavery; and that we ought to feel the chain whichbinds them around our own limbs, and straggle withthem and for them until they are set at liberty. The meeting was addressed with great energy andpower by Mr. Burleigh, C.L. Remind, and S.S.Foster. Some remarks were also made by the Rev.Calvin Fairbanks. SECOND DAY — MORNING SESSION. The PRESIDENT announced that the resolutionswere in order. Mr. BURLEIGH opened the discussion. He saidit was their duty to do so, as having the affirmative.He would give some of the reasons why he,and those who thought with him, condemn theConstitution, and take their position outside the governmentWe say the government is wrong. We say that the slavehas a right to escape; that the master has no rightto detain or retake him; and that no one else has aright to do that which the master has no right to-do. We believed the Constitution does require that weaid in the reclamation of the fugitive slave, if weacknowledge the rightfulness of the government. Our friend (Mr. Smith) and others would say withme, that if the Constitution required this, it would beour duty to trample it under foot. If we take the terms of the Constitution, 'law,''held to service,' and 'labor,' in the understood andpopular sense, we must take the ground that we areby the Constitution bound to give up fugitive slaves.We are to act on what is believed by the parties tobe law. Parties agree to what tiny believed they agreeto. He illustrated it in this way: A man goes to thecity of Network, and goes through the streets, crying,' Mud for sale.' A man goes up and looks atthe content of the tub, and find sit contains goodthe contents of the tub, and finds it canting goodmany cents per pound. He gave the man tounderstand, by the sight of the honey on the top of thetub, that he meant good honey, when he cried 'mudfor sale,' and he was bound to deliver good honey,for that was the article which his acts and the otherman's eyes led the purchaser to suppose he hadpurchased. believed suppose At the time of the Dorr rebellion, the fact thatthe government of Rhode Island called up on thegeneral government, brought the U.S. force to theirsupport. The fact that the South have representatives ofslave property makes them legislators for us. I cannothave them legislate for me. Our doctrine is, 'No urban with there holders.' Any one who adopts the conclusions we do, inreference to fugitive slaves, insurgent slams, and inreference to slavery generally, must adopt our conclusion— No union with slaveholders.' No union with slaveholders. If you think the Constitution is anti – slavery, youhave already dissolved with slaveholders. They knowof ho already government; and my friends solvents,Thomas, and others, are out of a union with slaveholders,as much as I am. GERRIT SMITH replied: I my, with the celebratedGrecian, 'Strike, but hear me.' I should beforeyou as the representative of the Liberty Party.Do not condors our party till you hear. It wasconferred last evening prematurely. I can accusermy friend Foster. Mr. FOSTER said it was not true he had trespassedupon the agreement. [The matter was waived for the present— Mr. Smithnot desiring to be interrupted.] Mr. SMITH: I wish to have it understood, that Igive no connect to any interruption. I respect, thatthe agreement of yesterday was violated least evening,by my friend Mr. Foster, in his reference to the libertyParty and the Constitution. The Liberty Party was organized take years ago,on the principle that A MAN IS A MAN. WeWheat on for for live or six years, never dressing ofrotting with any man who did not agree with as,At length, in an unhappy hour, when our numbersreached 70,000, many of our men were impactionfor more rapid progress, and Joss P. Halls wenumbered for the Presidency — and Gee sell, andBrinkley, and G, and all, were passed by — andit was every for there these to slides into the supportsof \martin Van Burne or John A. Dix, or any otherrevisers of the most sneered rights of men. Mr. Festerridiculed us for the couture's of these men whohere slandered us. Was this just? The time was,when Truth was never no glassiness on where reducedto one, in the persons of our Lard Levees Christ's, onthe cross, when his disciples had bad.  What is the objection to the Liberty Party? Whatis it? Is it that that party were for civil ruler?May it not rate for civil rulers? No; not under theConstitution. But I hold that we bright vote farcivil rulers, sure if these were no Federal Constriction.The right to rote for civil rules sever ides allhuman constitutions and all human arrangements— itis a God-derived right. I go to the path with any brighter, and we electa good and human man. He is asked to sigh apaper, made sometimes ago, anything the existence ofa God, He consist is a but is be not banned toenter upon his office? We are bound to do all wecan to maintain a righteous civil government. Whateverrespect we may own to our dead fathers, weshould pay more respect to our living salves, and tothe living God. A man is elected President, who does not believeit's the justice of the Constitution, and would nota wear to support it; yet we would require that heTake his seat, and discharge his dug ion. I dandy theright of former generation to control are action oropinions. Suppose Wm. Goodell were elected President,and should wear to support the Constitution, andthen devote all his energies to the overthrow of slavery—ishe to be called a perjured by the Liberatorand the Anti-Slavery Standard? These is the mannerof those primers. Until this system is disposedwith, there can be no fraternal same upon one platform—theremost be some respect for the integrityof those whop differ from on. A prominent doctrine of the Anti- Slavery Societyis, 'No union with Slaveholders.' I am opposed tomemorials and ecclesiastical union with them. I amdo not use the products of slave labor. The personsall about here know that I am opposed to ecclesiasticalunion. But we are told we must not havepolitical union. But this is impracticable. It cannotbe done. it is an absurdity, and the most extraordinaryhumbug of the day. As well might a man andwife who did not agree, undertake no longer to beman and wife. It is objected, that we are to sit is Congress by theside of slaveholders. Suppose you, and brothersBurleigh and Foster, and my self, were elected toCongress, and we were to take our seats. Slaveholderswere elected, and came to take their saltsby our side. Brothers Foster and Burleigh wouldrun. Is that the way? Is that the Bible doctrine?When the sons of God were collected, and 'Satedcame also,' did the some of god that away? Not atall: it was Satan who went out. Am I to desert myduty, because a rascal comes and takes his seat besidesme! Truth should never retreat from error.It is the error that comes amongst as, and it mustwalk away, not us. Another objection to the Party is, that theybelieve the Constitution is anti-slavery. WilliamsLloyd Garrison believed so a few years ago. He hasundergone a change— for the worse, I think. Ibelieve him honest, and that he answers his conscience;but there is one thing wrong about him— be is intolerant.He says of me— 'Gerri Switch efforts to believethe Constitution anti-slavery.' This is allwrong. I hold that the Constitution is anti-slavery. Forthis reason: In point of that, no legal instrumentcan be pro-slavery. Brother Burleigh used to thinkso, and I used to love to hear his talk; but he haschange, however. I am a man of change. he whois opposed to change is a conservative, as emery ofprogress. law is for the protection of rights, not for thedestruction of rights. Murder is not no much thedestruction of rights as slavery. Law is simply the ruleor requirement of natural justice. To indent lawwith injustice is a mouton absurdity. It is to confoundright with wrong; and this accounts for theconfused notions of the character and obligations oflaw. Until men come to regard law only as commandingwhat is right, and prohibiting only what is wrong,law will never be respected. These views utterly negate the idea that slaverycan be legalized. the constitution cannot be pro-slavery, onaccount of the restrictions which its framers imposedupon them selves when framing it. I cannot bedislodged here. a few men there wished to have many thingsinserted in favor of slavery, but found they could not.That convention unanimously — O, listen to mehere! — struck out the slave, and substituted' service,' which applied to the condition of the freeman.They had to hear Madison say, that the Constitutionmust NOT RECOGNIZE PROPERTY INMAN. I hold that to gee slavery in that Constitutionwas wholly impracticable. For the advocates ofslavery to gt it in under such circumstances wouldbe to circumvent 'Old Nick' himself. You might aswell attempt to build a fire in the see, in the languageof Shakespeare— ' To talk of life and amity,'Twixt snow and fire.'  The Constitution is either for slavery or againstslavery. If a portion is for slavery, and a portionfor liberty, the legal rule is, that the portion for slaveryis to be thrown out. The rule is, that error isto retreat before truth. The Supernal Court of theUnited States expressly decides, that where rightsare overthrown, unless the instant ion is perfectly clear,expressed in unmistakable terms, those fights are notoverthrown. the slavery character of the Constitutionis not sop expressed, and cannot be maintained. Mr. BURLEIGH answered several personal alterations,and went on to say, that his political time optdemarcation was not Mason and Danice's line, butwas defined by those who were the supporters andabettors of slavery. In reference to the visit of Satan,he would say, that Satan get what he wentas. URLEIGH Mr. Smith asks us, what harms to believe the Constitutionanti-slavery? It is not far him to ask anyman, what harm to support as error, if it be such. He amines that that cannot be law which tramplesupon right. With that definition, it is plainthat the Constitution is pro-slavery; in other words,that it is an illegal Constitution. A law is a contractbetween portion, and must be maintained accordingto its terms. Mr. B. went on and examinedthe origin and nature of law. Mr. B. referred to the maintained vote in theConvention which framed the Constitution, to substitute'services' for 'servitude,' as conclusive that the fewwho were favoring slavery were satisfied theyrecurred the thing desired by them. Janis Madison was referred to, He said that theConstitution is better for the slaveholders than theConfederation; for the Constitution allows the slaveholdersto close their many way salvers to the freeStates, which the Confidence nation did not.

 Mrs. Swiss helm, in a notice of Mrs. Wilson's workon the Rights and Duties of Woman, gives the herdof 'dry and sapless commentators' upon the Biblethis back-handed thrust::— 'Our reason for. not reading commentaries is, thatGod either did or did not intend the Bible for thecommon herd. If He did, He must have intended towrite it so that the common herd could understand.If He accomplished his design, common people canunderstand it; and if He failed, nobody can mend thematter. If He did not intend it for the laity, and soplaced it above their comprehension, nobody has aright to thwart His intentions by any simplification.So we plead a total ignorance of the authors fromwhich Mrs. Wilson quotes. We have never attemptedto wrangle with commentators about woman's socialposition. Our purpose' has been to aid in showingthat the equality of the sexes is a great natural,fundamental truth; a fact capable of demonstration,and one. lying at the very foundation of human progressand human happiness. When the subject isonce fairly established on this basis, we can safelytrust the commentators to prove that it is altogetherand entirely scriptural; for, so far as we know anything of this class of writers, they are the greatconservatives of every age, always following in thewake of public opinion', never leading it.' He COLORED SETTLEMENTS IN MICHIGAN.—There isin Cass County, Michigan, a large settlement of coloredpeople, mostly from the Southern States. They havea line location, well tilled farms, neat and conformablecottages and buildings, and live an industriousand happy life. The Goshen (Indiana) Democrat, says:— OLORED ETTLEMENTS IN ICHIGAN. Yesterday morning about 50 colored persons passedthrough our. village on their way to Case Co Michigan.They had just been manumitted by a wealthyplanter in Virg. A happier set of fellows we believewere never seen. Their faces were set as aflint to the North, their free and happy homes. Aboutten of their number were fugitives who joined thetrain after they left Virginia, but Who, too, long tosee the promised land. Michigan affords many advantagesto the colored man, which he cannot havein any other State, South or North, and we are happyto be informed that of the hundreds who haveavailed themselves of a home in Michigan, there arebut few who make-unworthy citizens.'  ☞At Rome, an unfortunate parrot, announcedby one of the Papal spies as having uttered seditiouscries, was arrested by the police, and, without a hearing,executed on the spot.

 Mr. B. took the ground that the preamble of aConstitution qualifies and explains the intent orUnderstanding of its specific provisions, but does notControl them. If the preamble of our constitutionSays it is ordained to establish 'justice,' it shows thatIn the opinion of the frames of the constitution, itWas a matter of 'justice' to reclaim fugitive slaves. MR. b. went on to argue the pro-slavery characterof the constitution from the provisions in referenceto representation. He insisted that the language ofthe constitution in some instances applies to slaves,and could apply to no other parties. Mr. B. protested that he had always made adistinction between the legal character of the constitution,and the intent of its frames, at the time heheld the views referred to by Mr. Smith. Mr. FOSTER would like to correct the statementof Mr. Smith. He did not ordinarily noticeaccusations against himself; but Mr. Smith was agentlemen who had earned a character for justice andhumanity, which made him regret any such statementfrom him. The charge was, that in ridiculingthe Liberty party last evening, he had so understandagreement; of yesterday. He did not so understandthe matter; he did not believe he had violated anyagreement. He had ridiculed the Liberty party, forthe reason that they occupied a ridiculous position.

 argument of CHARLES SUMNER, ESQ. in the case ofSarah C. Roberts us. The city of Boston— before theSupreme court of Massachusetts, Dec. 4, 1849. argument of HARLES UMNER, SQ. in the case ofSarah C. Roberts us. The city of Boston— before theSupreme court of Massachusetts, Dec. 4, 1849. [CONCLUDED.] there are some other matter not strictly belongingto the juridical aspect of the case, and yet ofimportance to its clear comprehension, upon which Ishall touch briefly before I close. It is sometimes said, in extenuation of the presentsystem in Boston, that the separation of the white andblack children was originally made at the request ofthe colored parents. This is substantially true. Itappears from the interesting letter of Dr. Belknap, inreply to Judge Tacker's queries respecting slaveryin Massachusetts, written at the close of the last century,(4 Mass. Hist. Coll., 207,) that at that time nodiscrimination on account of color was made in thepublic schools of Boston. 'The same provision.' Hesays, 'is made by the public for the education of thechildren of the blacks, as for those of the whites. Inthis town, the committee who superintend the freeschools have given in charge to the schoolmasters toreceive and instruct black children as well as white.'Dr. Belknap adds, however, that he has not heard ofMore than three or four who have taken advantageOf this privilege, though the number of blacks inBoston probably exceeds one thousand. It is to beFeared that the in human bigotry of caste— said relicOf the servitude from which they had just escaped;— was at this time too strong to allow colored childrenkindly welcome in the free schools, and thatfrom dity and ignorance, they shrank from takingtheir places on the same benches with thewhite children. Perhaps the prejudice against themwas so inveterate that they could not venture to asserttheir rights. It appears, that in 1800 a position waspresented to the School Committee from sixty-six coloredpersons, praying for the establishment of aschool for their benefit, Private munificence cameto the aid of the city, and the present system ofseparate schools was brought in to being.  These facts are interesting in the history of theBoston Schools, but they cannot in any way affectThe rights of the colored people, or the powers of theCommittee. These rights and these powers stand onThe constitution and laws of the common wealth.Without adopting the suggestion of Jefferson, thatOne generation cannot by legislation bind itsSuccessors, all must agree that the assent of a few percents,Nearly half a century ago— at a time whenTheir rights were imperfectly understood— to anConstitutional and illegal course, cannot alter theConstitution and the laws, and bind their descendantsFor ever in the thrall of caste. Nor can theCommittee derive from this assent, or from any lapseOf tome, powers in derogation and Of the rights of man. it is clear that the sentiments of the colored peoplehave now changed. The present case, and thedeep interest which they manifest in it, throngingthe court to hung on this discussion, attest thechange. With increasing knowledge, they havelearned to know their rights, and to feel the degradationto which they have been doomed. Theirpresent effort is the taken of a manly character, whichthis court will cherish and respect. The spirit ofPoal now revives in them, even as when he said'' I am a Roman citizen.' But it is said that these separate schools are for themutual benefit of children of both colors, and of thePublic Schools. In similar spirit, slavery is comeTimes said to be for the mutual benefit of master andSlave, and of the country where it exists. In oneCase, there is a mistake as great as in the other.This is clear. Nothing unjust, nothing ungenerous,Can be for the benefit of any person, or any thing.Shortsighted mortals may hope to draw from someSeeming selfish superiority, or from a gratified vanityOf class, a permanent good; but even- handed justicebukes these efforts, and with certain power redressedThe wrong. The whites themselves are injuredBy the separation. Who can doubt this; with theLaw as their monitor, they are taught to regard aPortion of the human family, children of god, createdIn his image, co-equals in his love, as a separateAnd degraded class— they are taught practicallyTo deny that grand revelation of Christianity— theBrotherhood of Mankind. Their hearts, while yetTender with childhood, are necessarily hardened byThis conduct, and their subsequent lives, perhaps,Bear enduring testimony to this legalized uncharita-bleness.Nursed in the sentiment of Caste, receivingIt with the earliest food of knowledge, they areUnable to eradicate it from their natures, and thenWeakly and impiously charge upon their HeavenlyFather the prejudice which they have continue toEmbody and perpetuate in their institutions. TheirCharacters are debased, and they become less fit forThe magnanimous duties of a good citizen.  The Helots of Sparta were obliged to intoxicatethemselves, that they might teach to the children oftheir masters the deformity of intemperance. Inthus sacrificing one class to the other, both weredegraded— the imperious Spartan, and the debasedHelot. But it is with a similar double-edged injusticeThat the School committee of Boston have prejudiceOr fancied advantage of the white. It is fit that a child should be taught to shuntwickedness, and, as he is yet plastic to receiveimpressions, to shun wicked men. Horace was right.When, speaking of a person morally wrong, false andUnjust, he called him black, saying. —'his, niger, est, hunc tu, Romanc, caveto.The Boston Committee adopt the warning, but applyIt, not to those black in heart, but only black inSkin. They forget the admonition addressed to theProphet: 'But the Lord said unto Samuel, look notOn his countenancer, for the Lord seeth not as manSeeth: for man looketh at the outward appearance,but the load looketh at the heart.' (I. Sam. 16:7.) look notOn his countenancer, for the Lord seeth not as manSeeth: for man looketh at the outward appearance, Who can say, that this does not injure the blacksTheir, in its best estate, is an unhappy lot ShatOut by a still lingering prejudice from many socialAdvantages, a despised class, they feel this proscriptionFrom the Public Schools as a peculiar brand.Beyond this, it deprives them of those heal h b, ani-Matinginfluences which would come from a participationIn the studies of their white brethren. It addsTo their discouragements. It widens their separationFrom the rest of the community, and postponeThat great day of reconciliation which is sure toCome. The whole system of Public Schools suffers also.It is a narrow perception of their high aim whichLeaches that they are merely to furnish to all theScholars an equal amount in knowledge, and that,Therefore, provided all be taught, it is of little cones-Quincewhere, and in what company it be done.The law contemplates not only that they shall all beLaugh, but that they shall be taught all to gather.They are not only to receive equal quantities ofKnowledge, but all are to receive it in the same way.All are to approach together the same commonFountain; nor can there be any exclusive sources forAny individual or any class. The school is the littleWorld in which the child is trained for the largerWorld of life. It must, therefore, cherish andDevelop the virtues and the sympathies which areEmployed in the larger world. And since, according toOur institutions, all classes must, without distinctionOf color, in the performance of civil duties, so shouldThey all meet, without detection of color, in theSchool, beginning there those elations of equalityWhich our constitution and precise to all. taught all to gather. As the State receives strength from the unity andsolidarity of its citizens, without distinction of class,so the school receives new strength from the unityand solidarity of all classes beneath its roof. Inthis way, the poor, the humble, and the neglectedshare not only the companionship of their morefavored brethren, but enjoy also the protection of theirpresence, in drawing towards the school a morewatchful superintendence. A degraded or neglectedclass, if left to themselves, will become moredegraded or neglected. To him that hath shall begiven; and the world, true to these words, turnsfrom the poor and outcast to the rich and fortunate.It is the aim of our system of public schools, by theBlending of all classes, to draw upon the whole schoolThe attention which is too apt to be given only to theFavored few, and thus secure to the poor their portionOf the fruitful sunshine. But the colored children,Placed apart by themselves, are deprived of this blessing. Nothing is more clear than that the welfare ofclasses, as well as of individuals, is promoted bymutual acquaintance. The French and English, fora long time regarded as natural enemies, have at last,from a more intimate communion, found themselvesto be natural friends. Prejudice is the child ofignorance. It is sure to prevail where people do notknow each other. Society and intercourse are meansestablished by Providence for human improvementthey remove antipathies, promote mutual adaptationand conciliation, and establish relations of reciprocalregard. Whose sets up barriers to these, the wartsthe ways of providence, crosses the tendencies ofhuman nature, and directly interferes with the lawsof god. May it please your Honors: such are some of thethings which it has occurred to me to say in thisimportant cause. I have occupied much of your time,but I have not yet exhausted the topics. Still, whichway so ever we turn, we are brought back to one singleproposition— the equality of men before the law.this stands as the mighty guardian of the rights ofthe colored children in this case. It is the constant,ever-present, tutelary genius of this common wealth,frowning upon every privilege of birth, upon everydistinction of race, upon every institution of caste.You cannot slight it, or avoid it. You cannot restrainIts. It remains that you should welcome it. Do this,And your words will be a 'character and freehold ofRejoicing' to a race which has earned by muchSuffering a title to much regard. Your judgment willBecome a sacred landmark, not in judgment willBut in the history of freedom, giving preciousEncouragement to all the weary and heavy- linden way-Farersin this great cause. Massachusetts will then,Through you, have a fresh title to regard, and be onceMore, as in times past, an example to the whole land. the equality of men before the law. You have already banished slavery from thiscommon wealth. I call upon you now to obliterate thelast of this footprints, and to banish the last of thehateful spirits in its train, that can be reached by thiscourt. The law interfering to prohibit marriagesbetween blacks and whites, has been abolished bythe Legislature. The railroads which, imitating theBoston school, placed colored people in a car byThem selves, have been compelled, under the influenceOf an awakened public sentiment, to abandon thisRegulation, and to allow them to mingle with otherTravelers. It is only recently that I have read thatHis Excellency. The present Governor of Massachusetts,Took his seat in a car by the side of a negro.It is in the Caste schools of Boston that the prejudiceOf color has sought its final legal refuge. It is forYou to drive it forth. You do well when you rebukeAnd correct individual offences; but it is a higherOffice far to rebuke and correct a vicious institution.Each individual is limited in his influence: but anInstitution has the influence of numbers organizedBy law. The charity of one man may counteractOr remedy the uncharitable ness of another, but noIndividual can counteract or remedy the uncharitable nessOf an established institution. Against it privateBenevolence is powerless. It is a monster whichMust be hunted down by the public, and by its constitutedAuthorities. And such is the institution ofCaste in the public schools of Boston, which nowAwaits its just condemnation from a just Court. The civilization of the age joins in this appeal.It is well known that this prejudice of color is peculiarTo our country. You have not forgotten that twoYouths of African blood only recently gained theHighest honors in the college at Paris, and dined onThe same day with the king of France, the descendantOf St. Louis, at the palace of the Toiletries. AndLet me add, if I may refer to my own experience, thatIn Paris, I have sat for weeks, at the School of Law,On the same benches with colored persons, listening,Like myself, to the learned lectures of DegradeAnd of Russia— the last is the eminent minister whoHas unhappily fallen beneath the dagger of a RomanAssassin; nor do I remember observing in the throngOf sensitive young men by whom they were surrounded,Any telling towards them except of companionshipAnd respect. In Italy, at the Convent of Pallazuola,On the shores of the Alban Lake, and on the site ofThe ancient Alba Longer, I have seen, for several days,A native of Abyssinia, only recently conducted from]His torrid home, and ignorant of the language thatWas spoken about him, yet mingling with the FranciscanFriars, whose guest and scholar he was, in delightfulAnd affectionate familiarity. In these examplesMay be discerned the Christian spirit. And. Finally, it is this spirit that I invoke. Wherethis prevails, there is neither Jew nor Gentile, Greeknor barbarian, bond nor free; but all are alike. Itis from this Thai we drive now and Solemn assurancesof the equality of mankind, as an ordinance ofgod. The bodies of memo may be unequal in beautyor strength; these mortal cloaks of flesh may differ,as do these worldly garments, these intellectualfaculties may vary, as do the opportunities of actionand the advantages of position; but amidst all unessentialdifferences, there is an sectional agreementand equality. Dives and Lazarus were equal in thesight of god. They must bra equal in the sight ofall just institutions. But this is not all. The vaunted superiority of thewhite race imposes upon it corresponding duties.The faculties with which these are endowed, and theAdvantages which they possess, are to be exercisedFor the good of all. If the cores people are ignorant,Degraded and unhappy, then should they be theEspecial objects of your care. Form the abundanceOf your possessions, you must seek to remedy theirLot. And this court, which is as a parent to all theUnfortunate children of the common wealth, willShow it self most truly parental when it reaches down,And, with the strong arm of the law, elevates,Encourages and protects its colored fellow- citizens.

Afternoon session. The meeting was called toorder at quarter before 3' o' clock, and the proceedingswere intruded by an anti-slavery song from a volunteerchoir, as was the case with nearly everysubsequent session. The president, on motion, appointed the followingpersons a committee to report a list of officers of theSociety for the ensuing year:— Edmund Quincy,Bourne Sponger, William Ashby, Joshua t. Everett,John T. Hilton, Elias Richard, John Bailey, E. WTwinge. Wendell Phillips, from the Business Committee,reported the following resolutions:— 1. Resolved, That surprised as we sure at the simplicityof the Northern press and Northern membersof Congress, in urging so incessantly upon Southerndisunions that their course will defect theirobject, since in the union and under the constitutionis the only security for the permanence and quietenjoyment so slave property, we are still more disgustedat the unblushing impudence with which these sameeditors and politicians rise from their servile knees toask of the abolitionists the support of that veryinstrument which they have just proved to be the cornerstone of bondage, and a comfort to the oppressor. 2. Resolved, That we look upon it as one source ofrejoicing even in its overthrow seems destined to wakento life the torpid conscience of the nation, toquicken its sense of justice, and to recall pure religionto the desecrated temples and whiter sepulcherswhich have so long passes for its shrines. 3. Resolved, that one chief reason why we enterour rebuke against the church is, that having solong scattered the seeds of reform, she sits still, nowthat the fields are white for the harvest; that she]disowns the principles which have sprung from herbosom, brands them as infidel, and gathers into herfold those timid sheep, whom she can still govern,rest they web corrupted by the 'running to and fro, andincrease of knowledge' which her prophets have foretold;that, claiming to have a on the breastplate ofrighteousness, she refuses to have any thing to do withthe battle; claiming to hold the sword of the Spirit,she keeps it nicely sheathed, while other man contendfor the faith once delivered to the saints; and in viewof these facts we pronounce her claim to be theChurch of Christ an idle blasphemy. 4. Resolved, That, in view of the anti-slavery progresso the past year, it must be matter of surprise toall coming time, that in a nation sprung from Englishand Puritan ancestry, the political arena should bethe first to awaken to its duty on a great moral question,and that an agitation like that of anti – slaveryshould owe its progress and success far more to theforum than the pulpit, to the selfish broils and timeservingmotions at Washington, than to those whoassume to fill the pulpits of cooper and Mayhew, andto teach the Gospel of Christ. 5. Resolved, That we look on the present session ofCongress as the most useful since the organization ofthe Government, and consider its character thee resultnot only of the virtue and independence of a fewleading minds there. But of that awakened publicopinion of the free States, of which Washington isbut the echo; and this conviction gives fresh animationto the zeal with which we set ourselves again tothe work of re- educating a corrupt ad besotted people. 6. Resolved, That we seek a dissolution of thisunion, first as a measure of individual duty to ceaseform sustaining a great evil; secondly, to secure freeaction and expression for that degree of anti- slaveryfeeling which even now exists in the nation, andwhich either soothed by the pride, cajoled by theprofessions, or intimidated by power of the greatnational parties and seat; thirdly, by abstaining fromall guaranties to the master to leave tee balance evenbetween the two races; fourthly, to bring closer tothe southern conscience the indignation and moralrebuke of the age, now confused and restrained by afusion of these states; and lastly, to bring to bear onthe institution of slavery those principles of the relativevalue of the free and slave labor, of the unchangeableconnection of national prosperity with popularprogress and the elevation of the masses, which hasswept chattels from Europe, and will put end toin here whenever the break water of the union, whichnow shields the south from their reach, is removed. 7. Resolved, That in the lamented death of DavidRoles, we mourn the loss of an early, active, sagaciousand persevering friend of the anti- slaverycause— of one whose professional ability makes hisdecease a public loss, and whose position and successwere doing much to weaken the cruel prejudiceagainst color— of one whose career proves the powerof individual intellect and energy in making their wayunder the most trying disadvantages of race and position,and of personal infirmity and ill- health; and thatWe command the conduct and character of Dr. Gurglesto the vigor of a pro-slavery community, as evidenceof the vigor of race born down by so manyburdens, and to our colored friends as a model, theimitation of which cannot fail to secure their elevationand improvement. PARKED PILLSSURY spoke to the first resolution,and made some very forcible and instructive remarkson the duties of abolitionists at home, and in theirdaily intercourse with those around them. ARKED ILLSSURY EDMCND QUINCY followed in an able speech. Thefollowing outline of it we take from the Boston Eveningtraveler: DMCND UINCY Boston Eveningtraveler: He thought there was no reason why abolitionistsshould despond. Who should be proud, if not abolitionists?What class of men has made such animpression upon the community? Has not the systemof religious revivals nearly gone into decay? This isthe triumph of the Abolition agitation; not realreligion, but that religion which passes by on the othersaid, the sufferer of the wall. Barer since, he said,we have  to  every as a notion,our religious his delivered. He the days catering of  has this copies whichbound has to support array, there was not a preslaverywinder to be land.

Unfortunately, far furthersCommon of to left their proved situation for aLaw paltry commercial advantages obtained by theUnion of the states; and, since that, religion hasDeclined, because since then, religion sensitizes haveBeen trying to get rid of the question, not to abolishThe system. The spirit of the pipit in this typesets ofThe evolutions was right. What is it now. Why,That they recognize the legal right of the master to hisSlaves, and that nothing should be done to disturbThe peace of the States. The men of the ResolutionWere not already to disturb the peace of the states byTheir own or the cannot mouth. Abolitionists areNot , nor probably ever will be, but thereAre enough to keep on everlasting protest againstSlavery. Out Business is to continually ring the bellAnd be showing up the rottenness of the system; thatIn consequence of it, there is less religion and less loveOf liberty than when country was under the ruleOf George the third. We have been doing this forTwenty years; then there was but one man in favorOf immediate emancipation; and how many are thereNow? Ten it was deemed monstrous to call theSlave holders, who came here from the south, thieves,To be classed with those who, in party- coloredGarments, hummer stone upon the opposite side of theRiver; now millions believes in emancipation. TwentyYears ago, several escaped slaves were confined in ourJail at one time, and a coffins of slaves, manacled together,Has been, I am told, marched through. StateStreet, as is now done at Washington. Now the moneyPower of Boston, though not the highest exponentOf liberty, would rise up against such a degradation—Aye,even the living stone of State street would cryOut; and now, also, there is one place in our city thatIs sacred to liberty, and that is our common Jail. WeHave done something in twenty years if we have madeThe jail a temple of liberty; if this hall is not also-Togather free, the jail is. Some slaves have been carriedBack within twenty years, but they have beenKidnapped, and those who did it are liable to go toThe State Prison.       Who has effected this great change in public sentiment,but William Lloyd Garrison and those he hasco0llected around him — Phillips, Douglass, Remind.It was this man who, in 1831, with twelve others, metIn an old school- house, and formed the first Society inFavor of immediate emancipation; we as yet see onlyThe budding blossom of this action; it is destined toBe the true deliverer of the nation from that sin whichHas made us a hissing and a by – word among nations. There has been, he said, an attempt during the pastyear to prevent slavery going any father; to keepit where it is. John P. Hale, the great free Soilchampion, was willing to keep slavery within itspresent limits, but to protect and uphold it there. Thefeeling which brought forth the Free soil party wasthe result of the agitation of the abolitionists; theyare the men who have caused all the present effervescenceupon the slavery question, and though thefree Soil party will die, all that is good in it will liveand be felt in the Councils of the Nation; its memberswill in time reach the right path. The great ginsfatuous with them and with the people has been theConstitution of the United States. One would thinkThat this Constitution was a perfect palladium ofTroy, a Golden Shield of Rome. But some of us haveSeen the men who made it; some were good men,Some bad men, and a great many indifferent. WithoutThe Union, we should have been a confederationOf powerful States, and slavery would have disappearedAt the South as well as at the North. The South has gained every thing by the Union.Though in a large minority, she has an equal representationin the Senate, and more than a properRepresentation in the house, his son awards the NaryAnd the Army, to the exclusion of their portions ofThe Union; and during the whole period of our nationalExistence, save twelve years and some AlexanderMust be found to cut it and us free. WENDELL PHILLIPS referred to the fact that herB. Stanton, once deemed a very model of anti- slaveryFidelity, but who had in 1840 turned his back upon hisOld friends and fellow- workers of the American anti-SlaverySociety, having given himself up to politics,Has been Intel found voting, as a member of the NewYork Senate, to lay an anti- slavery resolution on the tableIn view of such an example of the moral declineOf a deserter, he saw no reason to be either ashamed orDiscouraged at the attitude in which the MassachusettsAnti- Slavery Society stands to- day. to lay an anti- slavery resolution on the table EVENINO SESSION. The Society re- assembled inFateful Hall, the President in the Chair. The resolutionsBefore the society were read by the secretary. SAMUEL MAY, Jr. supported the 5th resolution,referring to the present session of Congress as one ofthe most useful ever held, and said that he coincidedin the sentiment of that resolution most heartily. Forwe have seen, he said, for the first time, any considerablebody of men facing the South, and determinedto make no compromise with them. The genius of the South quailed before that unitedfew, though the North and South united to sweepthem away. It looked hopeful to see this; it seemedas if the strength of the Northern man was comingback to his sinews and his bones. Is this nothing torejoice at? What course will the slaveholder nowpursue? The last news from Washington is, thatMr. Clay is bending the force of his powerful mind toSee how the matter can be compromised; to see if heCan make the power of this great land bow downBefore The Moloch of slavery. This is the way the risingSpirit of freedom in the North is to be bound.We must meet the compromise with the denunciationIt deserves. We must hold up to the scorn andIndignation it merits, the compromising spirit withWrong which prevails through the land, and whichHas been the chief characteristic of the whole politicalLife of that truly American statesman; Henry Clay.And indeed the Constitution of the country, it self aCompromise with the most gigantic wickedness, compelsall who support it be compromisers — to be partnerswith thieves and adulterers, and partakers intheir unhallowed work. No man can swear faith to the Constitution, blackas it is with compromises, without being so corruptedand palsied in his moral ensue as be unable to dothe work of a freeman. Let us then, he said, seek itsdissolution, and go forth from the disgraceful and disgustingpartnership, which finds no parallel on thecivilized or uncivilized earth:— let us come out, ifMassachusetts stands sloe. ROHERT EDMOND, a Scotch gentleman, said hewould like very briefly to describe to the audiencethe treatment he had received in south Carolina forendeavoring to elevate the character of the slavepopulation, and teaching some slaves to read. He hadgone to South Carolina as a baker, but moral conditionof the slaves and colored people, that he thoughthe would attempt some thing for their benefit. Onone occasion, while teaching some slaves to read, aband of men, disguised, came to his school- house,dragged him a mile or more, and there stripped himof his clothes, and covered him with a coat of tar andfeathers, and then ordered him with a coat of tar andfeathers, and then ordered him, on peril of his life, toleave the State without delay. Mr. Edmond expressedthe astonishment he had felt, on coming to theNorth, and visiting different towards and villages forThe purpose of telling his story, to find now muchIndifference exists with regard to the slave's wrongAnd sufferings, and how strong a feeling there is, onthe actor hand, in the slave holder's behalf. He saidto had being slavery discovered at what hew hadexceptional serves the united States, though he single of his own land would headily ardentthe pray he said it hair return.  PAREKES PILLESSAR allowed. He commented onthe  of Mr. Blood. And upon our 'gleamedsaps' with the men who committed thatmean self dastardly attack upon him. The garb in that cowardly bonds had clothed him wasinduced to his a 'robe of right lameness,' of which Mr.E. would ever his  to be asked.    Mr. P. then contrasted, with this treatment of Mr.Emend the treatment which Southern men actually at the North. He referred to the adulationwith which the Boston Alias recently noticed thelina. Mr. Pillsbury then referred to the late letters ofFather Mathew to Judge Lumpkin of Georgia, readThat letter, with all its honeyed sad complimentaryPhrases, and rebuked the servile course which theApostles of Temperance is pursuing in the slaveholding states.   Apostles of Temperance WENDELL PRILLIRS took the case of Mr. Edmondas a lest far as able and ebullient speech, is whichhe portrayed the degrading effects of our slaveholdingalliance. Adjourned to Thursday, 10 o'clock, A.M. THURSDAY, NOV. 24. The Society again met in Fancily Hall, shad Presidentin the Chair. The Secretary read the first resolution. DANINL J. WARRNY, of Hopedale, spoke in supportof the resolutions before the meeting, salvagingupon the compromises with slavery in the U.S. Constitution.THOMAS HASSALS, of Gloucester, else spokeTo the resolutions. The Finance Committee reported the followingresolution for adoption:— Resolved, That the members of this Society, saidother persons in attendance, be requested to COM tributethe sum of one dollar, or such sum, either moreor less, as they may think right, for the purpose ofdefraying the necessary expenses of the meeting. They also gave notices that copies of the AnnualReport would be ready for distribution in the afternoon,And that each person contributing to the expensesOf the meeting would be entitled to a copy. the resolution was adopted. Some remarks were made, specially on the resolutionrelative to David Gurgles, by Wendell Phillipsand John M. Spear, and that resolution (No.7) wasunanimously adopted. PARKED PILLSSURY continued the discussion on theresolutions, alluding to a recent attack, in the Washingtonunion, on the Massachusetts Anti- Slavery society,on account of the Petition it is circulating in favorof secession from the Union. He spoke of thedoubtful and hesitating manner in which than freeSoil party had managed its own affairs; witness theSeven trials in Middlesex District to elect a memberOf Congress, in every one of which the free soilParty has been steadily losing ground, whereas, ifThey had agitated the District faithful and fearlessly,They might have completely triumphed longSince. Mr. Pillsbury also spoke of the effect of theAnti- slavery agitation, wherever thoroughly carried,In unmasking priestly manicuring, and in suppressingThose delusive excitements called religious revivals,In which it is only the pro- slavery religion of thisGuilty land which meets with any revival. ARKED ILLSSURY WENDELL PHILLIPS and PARKER PILLARCRY furthercontinued the discussion on the position and characterof the free soil party. The latter draw a strikingcontrast between the regard for liberty manifestedin this country and in turkey. (!) where, accordingto lieu, Lynch, whom President Polk sent on anexpedition to the Dead Sea, (with a view, as wassuggested, to the animation of  and Genderedon this reception) salaam of the any man to be held in slavery for a period exceedingseven years, and where there is 'no prejudice foundedon distinction of color; 'and the fact is stated that thepresent Governor of the Dardanelles is a black man,and was recently a slave. ENDELL HILLIPS ARKER ILLARCRY animation of  and Genderedon this reception   WILLAM A. WHRRE rose, he said, to bear his testimonyin favor of the Massachusetts Anti- slaverySociety, with its kindred societies, as the only organizationIn the land which goes for the liberation ofEvery slave in the land; and therefore, said he, IHonor the Society, and belong to it. But he did notAgree that the free Soil party is, as Mr. PillsburySaid, the worst of the three, and that its influence isMore to be feared than that of the other two. HeUndertook a defense of that party. Adjourned to 2 1-2 o'clock. AFTERNOON. Met pursuant to adjournment, thePresident in the Chair. Copies of the Annual ReportWere distributed. FTERNOON. G.W.F. MELLEN addressed the Society, andpresented certain resolution as substitutes for thosebefore the meeting. Not being seconded, they were laidon the label. ELLEN CHARLES LIST, Ear., of Boston, a member of theFree Soil party, spoke warmly and eloquently in defenseOf that party, and of his own course in joiningWith it. He claimed for it an anti- slavery character,And that much good had resulted from its labors. HeDeclared himself a believer in expediency as well asIn principle; and said he found himself unable to actAlways on principle, 9as he would be glad to do,) butThat he must, in many cases, be governed by expediency. HARLES IST, Edmund Quincy presented the following resolution:— Resolved, that every one who regards himself anabolitionist is urgently requested to pledge all thathe can give, all he can collect, and all he deems itcertain his town or society will give, to sustain thisSociety in carrying on a series of Conventions withIn this Common wealth, to rouse its catties to theirDuty to the slave. This, after some remarks in its support, was unanimouslyadopted. PARKER PILLSSURY made a very able replay to Mr.List, and especially to the claim he had set up, thatThe free soil party is the party of progress. WhatKind of progress is that. He asked, which goes, in itsList of Presidential candidates, from James g. Barney,A repentant slaveholder, and long a most efficientLaborer in the anti- slavery cause, back to John P. Hale,A man who openly, in the senate, declares him selfReady to fulfill all the Constitutional guaranties toSlavery, and to shed his heart's best blood rather thanNot fulfill them; and, again, from john P. Hale backTo martin Van Buren, the cunning and inveterate feelOf anti- slavery, the man who, in 1840. pledged himself,If elected to the Presidency, to votes any bill forThe abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia;This is progress, with a vengeance! ARKER ILLSSURY SAMUKL MAY, JR., with leave, stated to the audiencethe case of Alexander Asher, a fugitive slavefrom Cuba, recently arrived in this city, by the wayof Nova Scotia. The case elicited much sympathy,and several persons pledged themselves to aid himto find employment, and the heedful Sid meanwhile. Adjourned to the avenging, 7 O'clock. evening.

Edmund Quincy continued the appealand infrared the previous remarks. EWIS ORD, Rev. THEODORE PARKER came forward, and wasreceived with warm applause. HE spoke of the encouragingsigma of the times, and expressed a differenceof opinion from some of the speakers with regard tothe character of the free soil party. HEODORE ARKER WENDELL PHILLIPS replied to Mr. Parker, andvindicated the course of the Massachusetts Anti- SlaverySociety towards the free Soil party. ENDELL HILLIPS [we hope to give the remarks of both thesegentlemen, written out by themselves, next week.] At the conclusion of Mr. Phillips remarks, theSociety adjourned to 7 o'clock. EVENING SESSION. Meting called to order by thePresident, and an anti- slavery ado song. VENING ESSION. THOMAS JOHES, (once a slave in Williams, N.C.,) again addressed the meeting, he said he had oftenheard that William Lloyd Agrarian and his friendstalked against religion. But since he had heard andknown them for himself, he found it was not as. Hefound Mr. Garrison teaching a religion which locatedlove to god and love to man, and he thoughtWm. Lloyd Garrison and his friends had got the bestchurch he knew of anywhere. Mr. Garrison and hischurch had taken compassion on the poor, ignorant anddegraded slave, had remember him in his bounds, inhis sufferings, in his hungers, in his thirst, nod hadshown their love fore god, whom they have not seem,by loving their brother whom they have seen. I wasa Preacher to my people, said T. Jones, and I don'tlike to say too much against my brother of the clergy,but the truth must be told, and it is true that thechurches almost every where have shut their doorsagainst the slave and his cause, and goose into unionwith their oppressors. Now I call upon all of youWho profess Christianity, to show your religion byloving your brethren in bonds. HOMAS OHES, WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON then came upon theplatform. [It was the first time Mr. Garrison hadspoken, having been kept by illness from the previousmeetings, and he was greeted with heartycheers.] ILLIAM LOYD ARRISON At the close of your glorious anti- slavery cars painin Fateful Hall, he said, I present my self before you,not as I should like to do, but as I can — in a crippledcondition, yet not crippled by any of the dartsof pro- slavery, for none of them have ever reachedme; crippled as to bodily health, [Mr. Q. then laboringunder a spinal difficulty,] but still having a goodback- bone to my anti- slavery. I admire, and wouldimitable, the example of that indomitable combatant,of whom it is recorded that, after the amputation ofhis legs, he 'fought upon his stumps.' Pleasantry aside — I feel that, after you have hadbefore you a fugitive slave, to rehearse in your earsthe story of his wrongs and sufferings, and to pleadfor the deliverance of the millions who are still groaningin bondage, it would be presumptuous for anyother person to follow him, whatever might be thepower of his logic or the force of his eloquence, withthe expectation of deepening the impression alreadymade upon your hearts. A chattelized human beingis the best advocate of his own cause, however betokenhis dialect. As to the encomiums so profusely bestowed uponme by the fugitive friend who has just sat down, Iaccept them from that quarter as coming from a sincereand grateful heart. But if any are apprehensivethat I may get 'exalted above measure' by such flatteringallusions, let them remember the exhaustlessstream of above and misrepresentation that isconstantly poured upon my head, To keep an evenbalance of this occasion, I will present the other side ofthe picture. A few days since, I want to the Portland todelivered the anti- slavery lecture. A friend of mine, inthat city, anxious that a certain member of an Orthodoxchurch should hear it, invited him to be present.' If it were in my power,' replied this evangelicalprofessor, 'I would kick William Lloyd Garrison sofar beyond hell, that even the devil himself wouldnot be able to find him!' (Laughter,) 'The nexttime you see that benevolent man,' said I to myfriend, 'tell him I am greatly obliged to him for wish to brbeyond hell, where the devil can never find me — forthat surely must be in a heavenly state.' (Shouts ofLaughter.) I am sorry to say that when this pleasantTurn to his inconsiderate speech was communicated toThat 'orthodox' brother, instead of touching hisMagnanimity, he answered with great malignity of feeling'I wish I could kick the middle of hell,'that thus my eternal damnation might be made certain!(Strong sensation throughout the assembly.)So much for compliment and denunciation; Within the last three or four years, extra ordinarypains have been taken throughout the country,—fromthe occupant of the Presidential chair down tothe occupant of the pulpit — to eulogize the AmericanUnion as something worthy to be hallowed to theLatest posterity. The cause of this unusual display ofRegard for that 'covenant with death,' and that'agreement with hell,' is seen in the significant fact,that LIBERTY and HUMANITY are with increasing earnestnessand power demanding its immediate dissolution.Among those who have lately come to therescue of the Union, I am sorry to say, is the giftedpoet LONGFELLOW, some of whose best effusions havebeen in sympathy with the fettered slave (God neveryet having given to slavery a poet,) but who has nowProstituted his fine genius in praise o that which isCrushing the population to the earth. Mr. Garrison here read the following Apostropheto the Union, from a volume of Longfellow's Poems,just issued from the press:— Thou, too, sail on, O ship of state!Sail on, O union, strong and great!Humanity, with all its fears,With all the hopes of future years,Is hanging breathless on thy fate!We know what master laid thy kill,What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,Who made each mast, each sail, each rope,What anvils rang, what hammers beat,In what a forge and what a heatWere shaped the anchors of thy hope!Fear not each sudden sound and shock,This of but the flapping of the sail,And not a net made by the gate!In spite of rock and tempest roar,In spite of false lights on the shore,Sail on, our fear to breast the sea!Our hearts, our hopes, are all with three;Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,Are all with thee — are all with thee!                     These lines were read by Mr. Garrison as emphaticallyas though they were really his own sentiments— thus doing full justice to their artistic skill andbeauty — the galleries applauding with special animation.] If, Mr. Chairman, this tribute were only 'a poet'slicense,' and so understood — if it implied nothingmore than a graceful flight of fancy — it would notchallenge criticism; but this was not its design, andwill not be its effect on the popular mind. Alreadyit has been published far and wide in the newspapers,and no where with more sacristy than at the South.Now, sir, its description of the formation of the Unionis not only a poetical extravagance, but absolutely atvariance with historical verity. That Union wasformed in utter derogation of all the principles ofjustice, humanity and righteousness — solely by theimmolation of one sixth portion of the population on thestar of slavery — and through the most guiltycompromises. As affirming its real character and presentcondition, I propose, for the adoption of this Society,the following resolution:– Resolved, That it is with deep regret we perceivethat the poet LONOFELLOW has prostituted his finepoetical genius to eulogize the blood – stained AmericanUnion as freighted with the hopes and interests of Humanity —asbeing a noble ship, invulnerable tothe flock and proof against the storm, builtin the most skillful and workmanlike manner; whereas, the history of its creation and its cruisedemonstrates it to have beam— ——a perfidious bark, Built I' the' eclipse, and rigged with curses dark'—rottingthough all her timbers, leaking from stemto stern, laboring heavily on a storm – tossed sea,surrounded by clouds of disastrous portent, navigatedby those whose object is a piratical one, (namely, theextension and perpetuity of slavery,) and destinedto go down,' full many a fathom deep,' to the joyand exultation of all who are yearning for thedeliverance of a groaning world. [The reading of the resolution complicated suchapples singled with hisses.] There appears is be access different of spices inthis simultaneously, is regarded to the resolution just read; butI hold another resolution in my hand, which I willsubmit to the accosting, and which I am were will beresponded to more automatically, It reels to thatparsons anther and distinguished addressed of sufferinghumanity, G Thorough of England,(landappellation,) sad is as follows:—  Resolved, That from Fantail Hall the masteredanti- slavery Society sends forth its congratulationto GEORGE THOMPSON, representation ofthe Tower Hamlets in the British Parliament, and therepresentative of the down- Trodden of all nations inthe aroma of Humanity, at the promise and the prospectof his visiting the United States in the sourceof the present year — morning him of a warm andenthusiastic reception on the part of thousands andtens of thousands of the friends of nonverbal principles,multitudes of whom have been converted to thecause of the slave since he was drives from theseshores by operatic violence, and who years for thehour to arrive when they may have both the opportunityand the privilege to do honor to the manwhom they once, in their blindness or passion, wereled to despise or persecute. ['Three cheers for George Thompson,' aborted avenerable friend in the body of the house, and theywere given by the large assembly with great enthuseslams. Three additional cheers were given afterwardson the adoption of the resolution. After makingsome father reference to the services and merits ofMr. Thompson, Mr. Garrison proceeded:— In the course of your proceedings, Mr. Chairman,congratulation have been offered, very justly, bysome of the speakers, in regard to what has beenalready, achieved in behalf of the anti- slavery cause.Most encouraging indeed has been our success; wehave overcome a thousand formidable obstacles, andtrodden beneath our feet ten thousand soul- tryingdifficulties, and vanquished innumerable perils; we havecarried one outpost after another of the enemy, tillthe citadel alone remains to be taken. In proof ofthis, I will read an extract from a recent editorialarticle in Bennett's New York herald — a paper bribedto the support of slavery — a paper which has neveryet allowed an anti- slavery meeting to be held in thecity of new York without grossly caricaturing itsproceedings — a paper which has uniformly representedthe abolitionists as an insignificant and contemptiblefaction. Here what the Herald now says!] [The article, for which we have not room in thisconnection, traces all the difficulties in Congress, andin every legislature, North and South, to 'the antislaveryagitation' — and declares — 'The abolitionistshave driven the Whigs and democrats before them,like slaves under the lash of the whipper- in.* * *All other issues are forgotten. Tariffs, bank, internalimprovements, every old issue that has divided parties,is now buried in oblivion, and it is nothing butfree soil, abolition, into- slavery, now, What is to bethe result of such a state of things?* * * A separationand dissolution of this glorious Union.' Forall which, said Mr. Garrison, God be thanked!(Cheers and hisses.) Mr. Garrison confessed that all this was a flatteringview of the progress of the cause; but as for himself,he felt more inclined to forget the things that are behind,the trials and the triumphs of the past, and topress onward to the mark — the other extinction ofAmerican slavery. How much remained to be accomplishedWas seen in the fact, that there was not, afterTwenty tears of persevering effort, one single villageIn the country, however small its population, thatWas thoroughly imbued with the anti- slavery spirit;That there was not an anti- slavery pulpit or churchThat has a reputable character; and that the leadersIn Church and State are still with the oppressor. OnwardThen hand to hand and heart to heart! PARKER PILLSSURY took the platform. He read theresolution on American sympathy Hungary, andpreceded to show how  it is,especially when coming from slaveholders and theirabettors, from Zachary Taylor and Lewis Cass andtheir like. He read also the address lately madeto President Taylor, at Washington, by General Unhurt,one of the Hungarian exiles, and said if the fulsomeand disgusting flattery with which that address issurcharged, is any just exponent of the feelings andideas of the Hungarians generally, they are utterlyunfit for freedom, and well do they merit the deafestand sufferings which have come upon them.  WENDELL PHILLIPS made the closing speech, amost eloquent one, and frequently interrupted bycheers. He reviewed some of the notable events inthe history of the anti- slavery cause in Boston, fromthe time when Harrison Gray Otis sneeringly saidthat he heard that the abolitionists, in their madness,put the Bible above the Statute- book; he alluded tothe time when Peleg Sprague stood in Fateful Halland tried to awaken sympathy with the South bypointing up to the portrait of Washington, and callinghim 'that slaveholder'; he did not omit to callto mind Richard Fletcher's base attempts to propitiatethe South, nor the encouragement given to themurderers of Lovejoy, (at Alton,) by 'that infamousAtomic- General, James Tectonic Austin.' HeProceeded to show what had its position and attitudeOf the churches in Boston in the same period.Where, he asked, was Hubbard Winslow?Teaching that a minister's rule of duty, as to what heShould teach and preach, is 'what the brotherhoodWill allow and protect,' Where is the pulpit of theOld South; Sustaining slavery as a Bible institution.Where is Park street Church; Refusing toReceive within its walls, for funeral service, the bodyOf the only Matter which the Orthodox CongregationalistsOf New England have had, Charles T. Turkey,And of whom they were not worthy*. AndWhere is Federal street Church; Teaching thatLicense is the mission of the North with respect toSlavery, and closing its doors to the funeral eulogy ofFallen, the bosom friend of the only man who willMake Federal street pulpit to be remembered, WilliamEllery Chinning. And I might ask, he said,Where are the New South and Brattle street, — butThey are not. ENDELL HILLIPS * [The above is but a sketch of the commencementof Mr. P.'s speech,— we must leave the remainderuntouched.] SAMUEL MAY, JR., moved that the question be nowtaken on the resolutions, (upon which no vote hadpreviously been had,) taking up the resolutionrespecting GEOROE THOMPSON separately. The motionwas adopted. AMUEL AY, R., The resolution respecting Mr. Thompson was thenadopted by acclamation. The question being then taken upon the otherresolutions, they were adopted. The Society thane adjourned, sine die. N.B. During the first day of the meeting, theattendance was not so large as on previous years, probablynot exceeding 600 in the day, and double thatnumber5 in the evening. But the attendance rapidlyincreased on the second day, and the remainder of themeetings were like those of the old time, and worthyof the cause, very large and enthusiastic. The Finance Committee reported about onethousand dollars pledged to the Society, and payableduring the year, and over two hundred dollars paid in forexpenses and as donations. In addition to this, thesum of thirty- three dollars was collected for the slavegirl, Betsy Blakely. FRANCIS JACKSON, President. President. SAMUEK MAY, JR., AMUEK AY, R., Secretaries. ELIRA J.

 DEAR FRIEND GARRISON: EAR RIEND ARRISON: The reception which Lucy Stone and mud self metWith last Sunday, at Fox borough, is worthy of a briefNotice in the Liberator. We did not arrive until SundayMorning; but we found the Universalism minister,Rev. Holmes Slade, ready to receive us. AndHe ad made arrangements for us to occupy hisPulpit All day and evening. I addressed the people in theAfternoon, Mr. Slade interspersing the usual devotionalExercises, and Lucy in the afternoon, both of usUttering some of our most radical anti- slavery sentiments. At the close of the afternoon meeting, Mr. Sladewalked forward to the platform, and in a brief butvery eloquent address, expressed his high gratificationat our spirits, he invoked the blessing of Heavenupon us and the anti- slavery enterprise. We weretold his hand is ever ready to every good work. Our meeting in the evening was large and interesting.The Choir added very much to the occasion byTheir excellent performance. If we were every where received in this manner,there could be no warfare between us and the Church,and we flood. The people and minister there arevery desirous that Wendell Phillips should in likemanner give them a Sunday at his earliest opportunity. Yours, most truly, PARKKR PILLSRURY.

 From Young America BY THOMAS G. SPEAR. I chanced to stand beside the weedy grareof one apportion'd to his last domain:Them did the thickly tangled wild grass ware,And sond a flowery fragrance o'er the plain.    I seemed alone with Nature, as the skyBent its blue arch of beauty o'er my headsAnd saw around the bright green landscape lie,Alluring life to pause among the dead.    And there I mused, and felt the field-winds blow,With no sweet voice my footsteps to delay,Till o'er the plains, with trembling steps and slow,An aged man came wending on his way.    He paused beside me at the self-same monad,And praised the blandness of the summer air;And him I asked, if on that peaceful ground,He knew whilome the speechless slumberers there.    'Yes!' answered he, 'and hero could tell with pride,Of lives and deeds that history leaves untold—Of men of worth transcending, ere they died,Names on the world's great monuments enroll'd.    The village fathers sleep below. These stonesI oft converse with of the olden time;And hear lies one whose slowly mouldering bonesDid bear a spirit honored in it prime.    His once fair homestead graced the adjoining hill,And spread its fruitful acres o'er the plain;And yon bright streamlot turn'd the dashing mill,With which he ground his own &neighbors' grain.    His fields were cultur'd with a skilful hand,And brought him bounteous harvests, and his kineGraced in praline herds upon the land—A gift from God he thought not to resign.    There many years ho tilled his natal ground,And saw his boys to manhood round him rise,And at his door the suffering ever foundHelp and a friend to serve and to advise.    The soil where on the dwelt, through peace and war,Was his by purchase, and by long consent;Yet in the title there was found a flaw,.And he was made- the holder but at rent.

The wound—the wrong of that o'crshadowing,His little world of comfort left forlorn—Life was to him a waste without a flower,His children seatter'd, and his homestead gone.    Age crept apace upon the thews of youth—His stalwart frame was bent—his hair grew gray—His spirit sank beneath its load of ruth,Like autumn's trodden grass, arid pass'd away.    Here lies the wreck. He was indeed s man,A lord of earth, denied of earth a share,Save it might be this little narrow span.In-which to moulder—all the world would spare!'    'Is such,' I ask'd, 'the portion of the race?'Nay, 'its a grievous error of our kind;—God gave to man hid portion and his place;And earth, unto his sovereignty resign'd.    The land is his, the water, light and air,Life to enliven, and its wants supply—Give each enough, and there will be to spareMore for a ten times told humanity.    But usage and sophistic rule combined,Have made of Nature's heir, on land and wave,A being born with birthright unconfined,Whose only certain portion is—the grave!'    Long had I listen'd, as the good old manDiscours'd of life and the results of things,Less cheer'd by human practice than the planFrom whoso high laws each doily blessing springs.    The trees seem'd echoing back, the pregnant words,And as I went, Bad signs of povertyTold many a story of the sad recordsOf vested wrongs and landless liberty I
