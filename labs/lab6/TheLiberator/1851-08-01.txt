 THE on to               July   

 On the 4th of July, the opponents of accession hada great gathering at Greenville, South Caroline. It isand that not less than 4, 000 participated in the ceremoniesof the day. The Greensville Patriot states thatnever before was there any celebration at that placeat all comparable to it. 'Early in the morning crowdsof have beings rolled through our streets like thebillows of the ocean.' The Farewell Address ofWashington was road, as was also a patriotic ode, afterwhich Gen. Waddy Thompson addressed the vastmultitude. An address and resolutions were reportedby a committee, and adopted. Secession is opposedfor the following reasons:— Greensville Patriot 'But neither the going of the South, nor thecoming to of the North, will stay the uplifted handof secession in South Carolina! A State Conventionhas been called and members elected at a mostunreasonable time, in order to prevent discussionand division among the people! A majority of themembers, elected by less than one-fourth of therates of South Carolina, are pledged to a separateState secession. It is believed, however, that amajority of the people of this State are opposed toseparate secession, and a majority of her leadingmen have so expressed themselves. There is danger,then, of South Carolina going out of the Unionat the bidding of one-fourth of her population,and against the advice and counsel of her Chevesand Barnwell, and her Butler, and all his former ascentsamong the Judiciary of the State. It behooves the people then, to look to this master,and see if there be no means of defeating it andsaving the State. That secession will involve SouthCarolina in bloody civil wars and ruinous taxation,weaker and ultimately destroy the institution of slaveryand end in the degradation of the State, yourCommittee have not the slightest shadow of a doubt.That it is any remedy at all for the evils of whichthe secessionists complain, is to the minds of yourcommittee, preposterous and absurd. It will not restoreCalifornia, or open any wider the admissionof slavery into Utah and New Mexico. It cannotincrease the area of slavery, or prevent legislationon the part of Congress in relation to slavery. 'But secession will, if successful, most effectuallycircumscribe the area of slavery, and utterly ruin itis South Carolina. As soon as the State goes outof the Union every slave in it, and all their descendants,is all time to come, will be fixtures on our soil!If one should chance to be carried over the Savannahriver, has owner will forfeit, under the laws ofthe United States ten thousand dollars and incureven your's imprisonment and stand committed tillthe fine is paid! White persons may leave theState, but slaves cannot. Their labor may be valueless,but here they most remain. In the course oftime, their owners will run off and leave them, andSouth Carolina will become a black State, a secondSan Domingo, by the wisdom of secession. black State 'Once out of the Union, seeing the fate that awaitsher, South Carolina may attempt to avoid it by goingback into the Union; but here she may be not by amajority in Congress who will apply to her Constitutionthe Wilmot Proviso, as a condition precedentto her reentering the Confederacy of States! Herdoom will then be fixed beyond the possibility ofhope. 'Secession will deprive us of the constitutionalguarantee which we now have on the Northernpeople to surrender our fugitive slaves. We shallthen see Georgia and Alabama sending after andbringing back their fugitive slaves, but South Carolinacannot pursue hers, or attempt to bring themback. 'It is well known that the police regulations inCharleston, in relation is colored seamen, would notbe tolerated by Great Britain, but for the strengthand power of the Federal Government. Were SouthCarolina an independent nation, she would be theto repeal them. Indeed, we should be theprey of the abolitionists in all quarters of the world.and in no kingdom or nation on earth is that cleanmore powerful than in Great Britain. Her BritainMajesty's present consul in Charleston was sent,as we have understood, to effect a repeal of thesepolice regulations is relation to the imprisonment ofcolored seamen. By secession we give up all interest South Carlinehas in the territories, in the public lands, into the United States, and int the army and navy. Wewill be best without a vessel to protect our commerce,or a sail to defend our flag on the high seas. Weshall have neither a navy nor an army, nor the meansof raising and maintaining either the one or theother. The whole property of the State, lands andnegroes, goods and chattels, moneys and credits,would not support an army and navy capable of defendingour nationality five years! Our weaknessand insignificance in the eyes of the world wouldalmost deprive us of admission into the family of independentnations. If admitted, the republic, orkingdom, or oligarchy of South Carolina could hardlymaintain her foreign missions at the differentcourts of Europe. Hundreds and thousands of her citizens wouldinto the State to avoid the burdens of taxation,and that general blight and gloom which would pervadethe land. No one, however, could move out ofSouth Carolina without being an alien for five years.He would lose the right of citizenship, the right ofvoting, holding lands, serving on juries, and holdingcommissions under the United States or Statein which be might settle.  Living in South Carolina,we shall neither be able to inherit the lands ofour parents, children, or kindred, in the other States,nor will they be enabled t inherit ours! 'The is not all, nor the tenth of the evils and misfortunesto which accession will bring this onceproud and gallant State of the Confederacy. Hercommerce will forsake her—Charleston will no longerbe the emporium of the South. She can onlyimport for her own merchants, and sell to her owncitizens. Not a bale of her goods call got beyondher limits, in consequence of the duties which theywould have to pay. We should no longer see themerchants of Georgia and Alabama, Tennessee andNorth Carolina and Mississippi coming to tradewith Charleston. The cities of Augusta and Savannahon the one side, and Wilmington on the other,would literally strip her of her commerce, and makeher a pauper State compared to what she is now.of giving her prosperity by levying tenper cent. on goods now free of duties, and made inthe Northern States, for the purpose of having themsmuggled over the Savannah river, could have originatedwith none but a secessionist. 'The moment South Carolina secedes from theUnion, her railroads will be valueless, and her banksdestroyed. Her manufactories and public improvementswill sink into utter insignificance. Not abunch of yarn can get over the mountains of NorthCarolina without paying heavy duties. Every loadof apples or Irish potatoes which we receive inreturn must be stopped at the custom house, and payduties. The value of our lands will be destroyed,and our capital and enterprise driven from the State. 'But it is in vain to suppose that South Carolinawill thus be permitted peaceably to secede from theUnion. In the language of Mr. Burt, so true andas gallant a son as South Carolina possesses, "weneed expect no such event." The President is swornto enforce the laws, and for this purpose he in put incommand of the army and navy of the United States.the collection of the customs on board a vessel, inthe harbor of Charleston, might at once check makesecession and prevent a resort to force. But if it didnot who can entertain a doubt as to the result of acontest between South Carolina, without an army ornavy, and the United States with both equal to anyin the world for skill and science? A fourfold responsibilityrests between South Carolina, without an army ornavy, and the United States with both equal to anyin the world for skill and science?' A fearful responsibility rests on him who urges the State into sounequal a conflict.' Letters were received and read from Mr. Poinsett,W. J. Grsyson, Samuel Henry Dickson, Wm. C. Preston,and Wm. W. Boyce, Esqs., and Judge JohnBelton O'Neal. The Hon. Wm. C. Preston makes use of the followingstrong Language in his letter:— 'It is impossible, gentlemen, even from my veryrescinded position, not to look with the concern upon the attitude into which our State hasbeen  by the course of the General Government—an attitude requiring her utmost energy, fortitude and discretion.   'A desperate grievance would seem to authorizea desperate remedy, and yet I think not one so distinctive,so suicidal, as separate State secession.Our cases is that of the South, the whole South; andin my judgment, neither policy now hour, fair dealingnor safety, justify us in narrowing it down to amore local concern. South The problem to be worked out is, what is efficient,and not reckless. There is sometimes as much truecourage in declining a desperate advantage as in perishing in it.'

The readers of this journal need not now to betold, that for more then twenty years there havebeen a noble band of men and women in the UnitedStates, within their head quarters in Boston. who,under the name of Abolitionists, have been incessantly. with a seal, a courage, and a ,which, all circumstances con, we hold to bealmost ralloled in history, for the liberation ofthe 3,000,000 human beings who are held its in the Southern States of America.

Many a  mother'smorning exhortation has been blown to the moonby some light dinner guest who did not after allmean to give his real opinion, or whose opinion wasnot worth having.  And now, I assure you, my education went onrapidly. It is perfectly marvellous in how manyways and by what different  of people, a younggirl is taught that it is a terrible thing to be an oldmaid. Fools never show their folly more than intheir hackneyed jests upon this topic; but what shallwe say of the wine folk, who sin almost as oftenin the same way?

 The following is a more full report of the of the Rev. Mr. Thomas, at the Anti-Slavery Meeting.which it was impossible to insert in our lastnumber:—  The Rev. gentleman said he felt it to be his dutyto attend that Nesting having added hi  tothe advertisement which appeared in the Requirerbut he certainly had not anticipated bring  inthe prominent position be then occupied as the accorderof the resolution so eloquently introduced tothe notice of the meeting by the . His naturehad been  with that of the , and he hoped he might nap without beingthought egotistical, that he had enjoyed for someyears, the society and the hospitality of that distinguishedphilanthropist; and he believer it impossiblefor any one to have done so, without being insome degree animated with his spirit and by his example to labor in the good capes of negroipation. He felt that be should not be payingdue respect to the memory, character and labors, ofthe great Clarkson, had he not embraced that opportunity express his abhorrence of a m socruel and inhuman as the Fugitlve law ofAmerican He know that those  many gentlemenpresent more competent than himself to supporta resolution of so much importance as the one submittedto the meeting: but he might presume to saythat there was not one present who felt a deeper interestin every effort made to  the slavesof America from their cruel  and degradedcondition. He had hoped that the m wouldhave been held in Exeter Hall, but it was refusedthem on the ground of their being Unitarians. Hewas not  at the circumstance for the spiritof religious bigotry was alike in all places, in townand country, and wherever it had an opportunity ofexercising its baleful authority, it would do so, evenat the sacrifice of mercy and charity. The samespirit which denied them the use of Exeter Hall thatdiv, attempted, a few years ago to prevent Members.Cri and Remand. two acknowledged delegatesfrom the Anti-Slavery Society in America, fromholding a public meeting at Ipswich, because thosegentlemen were suspected of heresy, having beenseen in company with him, the Unitarian Minister;but he, with the delegates, was resolved on holdinga public meeting and exposing the anti-Christianconduct of those who professed to be lovers of libertyand the friends of humanity. For taking this decidedstep, he was singed out as an object of attackby the editor of a provincial paper, who demanded ofhim a public apology to be made to the venerableClarkson, and to the anti-slavery friends at Ipswich.Mr. Thomas observed that, fortunately for him, hewas some relieved from all anxiety about the affair,by the kindness of his friend Mr. Clarkson, who, notwithstandinghis great age and infirmities, and theinclemency of the weather, being in the depth of winter,waited upon Mr. Thomas to assure him of his approvalof the step he and the delegates had taken byholding an anti-slavery meeting in spite of sectarianopposition. (Hear.) The speaker said that he mentionedthin circumstance to show that as Unitariansthey were not to expect any favors from their Orthodoxneighbors,—no, not even the use of a room in whichto hold a meeting to advocate the cause of justiceand humanity. After noticing some of the publishedstatements of eminent scholars and divines in America,who countenanced the odious Fugitive Slavemeasure, he said it appeared to him impossible toreconcile them with the benevolent  of theGospel of Christ, which demanded of all men 'thatthey should do unto others as they would wish to bedone into.' He would not indulge in any hatowards the pro-slavery advocates in America,but he thought it was their duty as a Christinabody, to send across the Atlantic a stern remonstranceagainst all, whether Unitarian or Trinitarian,who supported so cruel and so as the Fugitive Slave Bill of America. He wishednor to detain the meeting longer and thereforebegged most cordially to second the resolution.  Requirer

 At a Committee Meeting of the above Society,held us Friday evening, May 16th, 1851, the following was unanimously agreed to:—  That, while this Committee desire to cherish themost friendly feelings, and to exercise all the requltof fraternal and Christian hospitably towardsany advocates of Temperance from America,who may visit this country, they feel it to be theirimperative  not to welcome to their platforms,or  any conference that may be held on the subjectof Temperance, any Minister of Religion, orother gentlemen (whatever may be his re from inhis own country.) who hesitates to avow His rence of slavery, and his earnest desire for its abolition;or who sets under the influence of the unnaturalprejudice against the colored portion of thepo. The Committee are the more determinedon this point, in consequence of the operation ofthe able Fugitive Slave Law and of the atrociousresolutions of the so-called SONS OF TEMPERANCY,heluding from their DIVISIONS some of themost consistent and exemplary Teetotalers, solelyon  of difference of color.        ONS EMPERANCY  IVISIONS  Thus Corrioittee feel it their duty, further, to urgeupon Temperance Societies, throughout the Kingdom,the adoption of a similar Resolution, both as asolemn protest against Slavery, and prejudice as tocolor, and for the purpose of  an encouragingtheir brethren, who are laboring hard toremove from their country the guilt and shar ofpractice, opposed a like to the claims of a commonbrotherhood, and the requirements of the blessedGospel.

 NEW ATNENS, O, July 8th, 1851. EW TNENS MR. GORDON—Circumstances have lately cometo my knowledge calculated to show by what spiritsome of the Christian bodies in our land are actuated;and as the facts my not be interesting toyour readers, I shall attempt to give them. Not longsince I chanced to be in Admps county, in this State—a part no way proverbial for anti-slavery sentiment—and while these, the following occurrencestook place:— R. ORDON  Some eighteen slave of Lewis county, Kentucky,in whose souls the burning  for  had becomean strong as to be irresistible, under the coverof night, succeeded in crossing the  Adamecounty. They travelled on a road lending north daylight, when it became necessary to seek a placeof contentment. Having left the road, they soughta hiving place in the woods. At length they ina thick  grove. Here they all hoping they might lie concealed till night, when theymight venture to travel with more ity. Herewere the husband and the wife, the parent and thechild. The farther, who had salt the deep of the slaveholders away no  to himselfa peaceful and quiet home in another land,where he may spend the remainder of his days inpeace, and around which his children may sport inhappiness and freedom. The mother, too. doubtlesslooks forward to the completion of her long journey,when, beyond the reach of the tynat master shemay  a home of peace and quiet and joy.           But, alas! how were their hopes blasted! Theywere discovered by four men,  of Adamscounty, who under the garb of friends, succeeded indecaying them to a home where they were kept inclose  during thirty-six hours, afterwhich fine they were  bound, and undercover of the night, were transported out of theState.    Now, this whole proceeding was without eventhe shadow of law. There was neither warrant,'power of attorney,' nor process; not even the tendermercies of the Fugitive Law were extended tothem. The whole was accomplished by and  force. By the laws of this State, it waskidnapping and the offenders are liable to be punishedby three years' confinement in the State Prison.It was also a violation of the 'higher law'—the law of God, as said down in Dent. 23; 13,Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servantwhich is escaped from his master unto thee.' Andyet the most active of these kidnappers are membersof the  Church. They hadnamed the name of Jews; they had  to loveGod; but 'if a man say be love God, and hateth hisbrother, he is a .'      For this  violation of the law of God andman, a charge was brought against, them in thechurch, and although they had committed a crimeagainst high Heaven and their own ; althoughthey had committed an  against theState and common humanity, they were retained inthe church the minister in charge Mr.  beingone of those     'Paid  who Judgment  and  the Of there high words which  and burnIn, warming and rebuke        any use of them offend against another by him for the  of debt, Mr. would have  in  achange—the  would have been But did they not  against than the  just named? not  It is  of slavery.

 WEST NEWPON, 23d July, 1851. EST EWPON MR.  R.  I have read the letter of Prof. Felton to the Boston copied into your paper of this morning, withfeelings of  which I must leave others to, for I cannot express. When I first heardthat he had renewed his attacks upon ms. (for I didnot  them, as to the credit of the village where Ilive, no copy of the Boston Courier comes to our PostOffice.) I thought I would lot him go on, and add tothe depth and breadth of that discredit which he hadbrought upon himself when he undertook to defendMr. Wter's had Latin and worse logic. Your publicationof his letter, in connection with that part ofmy speech delivered at Cambridgeport to which it has led to an alteration of my opinion. It is for public and not for personal reasons, however,that I propose to examine some of his charges. Boston     Boston Courier     In that speech, I adverted to some of the moral aspectsof slavery. As the Fugitive Slave Law makesthe North active participators in upholding slavery, Ithought it right that our people should know somethingmore about the system they were so vehemently to support. I therefore referred to that most feature by which all the ties of conjugal and fidelity, among three millions of ourfollow-beings, are lost without a single legal protection;and by which that virtue of the female sex,without which there can be no other virtue, in ,at all times and every where, to the mercy ofwehed men.      I think no one will say that this was a topic improperto be  on such an occasion. The vices of incontinence,and those crimes which none but personsin the married state can commit, are described in histories,explained in ethical treatises—rebuked fromthe pulpit, and their terrible consequences exemplion the stage. In thousands of instances, they aremarred to in parliamentary and legislative debates;and the speeches made on such occasions are publishedon newspapers that go into every household, andare read aloud by both sexes, without any other painthan that which arises in virtuous bosoms on a knowledgeof the commission of wrong. I know there aretheir who profess, like Mr. Felton in this case, to be or distressed at such allusions. But I believethey are wholly confined to those who are themselves of the offenses denounced, or to those who the same offenses in the chambers of their owninucantion but desire to conceal it from the world by of superlative modesty.         Taking it for granted, then, that such topics mayhis referred to on such an occasion, at least, when the of race is to be protected on the one side,and me of the greatest of national crimes to be avered the other, the only remaining question whichas  is, whether they are treated in a proper manner.And here I take it that the canons of proprietyare as well established, that not Mr. Felton, nor anythree men nor class of men, can unsettle or reversethem, without effecting an entire revolution in the sentiments of society. In works of science, incourts of law, in ecclesiastical councils, and on various acc every fact that knowledge has reachedand every crime against purity which the wickof man can commit, are explained, exposed and upon; and if the object of the writer orspeaker be good, if he seeks to enlarge knowledge,is innocence, or to avenge crime, then he addresshimself to the virtuous sentiments of mankind,and excites no improper emotions but in the minds ofthe dissolute, or, in the dissolute mind. Even if thespeeker or writer be unskilled in handling the instrumentof language, and injures his thoughts by an occa, or  of language, still,though we may smile at his mistakes, we always approvehis purpose.           the dissolute mind.    The same holds true, not in language only, but inconduct. Shakespeare makes Othello say of the purof women—  —Tis not to make me jealous To say, my wife is fair, seeds well, loves company,Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;where  is, these are more virtuous.'  these are more virtuous.  there are persons whom education, social position,or some other salutary restraint, withholds fromthe practice of unchaste vices, while they still grudgethe perpetrator hi illicit enjoyments. They revel andgloat with him, in imagination, and secretly regretthat they cannot keep him company.  An Irishman dreamed that his friend invited himis a treat, and asked him whether he would have hispouch hot or cold. Hot, said he; but while they it, he waked. Och, he exclaimed, how I wishI had  and then I could have drank it bewaking. So with the class of impure minds towhich I refer. They desire to extract from the emowhat they have lost in the sensation. When passages in the Bible are read, whose literal has not been  or paraphrased by our they never feel the rebuke of the saint,became they are so absorbed in the pleasures of the. They read Shakespeare to got a keener asof the joys of his drels, and not a more vivid of the purity of his heroines. If classtudents, they get an expurgate edition, whereall the  passages are collected at the end,and pore over the rejected parts. They think Scipiowas a  for relinquishing his captive. And if theylook at so humble an effort as was that of mine towhich Mr. Felton refers, to rouse indignation against more than savage barbarities which are dailyand  perpetrated at the South—not against  but against a whole race—abominationsthat now make this country the scandal of the civiworld, and its institutions the opprobrium of thename, they can  nothing in those wordsor  but lord allut and glowing obscenity.'Now a man who could do this, be he in what respective or office he may, would, on taking the was of  think with  upon visit. Hot                               I thank you, therefore, for publishing that part ofmy speech, in  with Mr. Felton's letter, I do not believe there is a man or woman inthe community of the virtuous, who will not say thatthere is not a word, not an idea, not an association, which  Mr. Felton any pretense, or shadowat  for the  he has deliberately He tells us, virtually, that as he read that partif my peach, his mind was filled with lewd images and that words, all 'glowing' with his  of Language. I do it. But as they are not found in theby the speech, whence could have come? Whence, but from the rankness of —from the succulence of his own                But  me hold up this Professor in a college and of youth, in another light. He rebukes me I rebuked on enormous  against the bodies of the women of an entire race. Had heany  for the sin, or its perpetrators?

Mr. Felton alludes to his year's defense of Mr.Webster's bad Latin. Has Mr. Felton so soon forgotten those  byDr. Beek in the 'L World,' which expend his ignorance on a subject to which so much ofhis life had been devoted? Mr. Felton  Sheknow that ninety-nine  of all the scholarsin the country condemned Mr. Webster's as soon as it appeared; and that after Dr. Bock's exposureof Mr. Webster and his jesuitical defender, that was installed at once, by all literary men, asone of the Du heroes? And in Mr.  youto be convinced of the popular  that his hadlatinity was the least part of his offense;—that beleft the honored post of a scholar to enter the  as a gladiator; that in selecting the  of Slavery of the side of Freedom, he abjured thegenerous spirit of the classics, which,. in the main, isa spirit of Liberty; and that he proved himself readyto prostitute literature, and belie the  for theignoble purpose of upholding a man who has donemore for the cause of slavery than any other man inour whole history? Doubtless that controversy wasin Mr. Felton's mind when he wrote his letter. Hetakes  of it to advise others not to mention it—But that he himself should have revived the remembranceof it can be accounted for only on that principleof mind which Lord Kames illustrates by a personat  He says that, when riding in hiscarriage, a man whom he did not know very officiallytendered him some assistance, and looked up at himas if demanding recognition. At last he exclaimed,'What, don't your Lordship know me? Why, I oncehad the honor to be tried before your Lordship forsheep stealing.'                Hetakes  of it to advise others not to mention it   As to Mr. Felton's charge, that I made a presentattack on Mr. Webster, I have but one word to say.I have expressed my views on this subject in thespeech above referred to. I there took the ground inpublic, which, for many years past, I have alwaysmaintained in private, that we ought to support noimmoral man for any office of honor and trust; andthat when a public man's vices become public, it isa most gross and mischievous misnomer to call themprivate, and thus shelter them from —If, therefore, to apply my doctrine, a man notoriouslyaddicted to intoxication, for instance, is a candidatefor the Presidency, it is the duty of all moral men todo all they can, and call upon the millions of temperancemen throughout the country, to ensure him defeat.The possession of great talents, so far from excusing,only makes the conduct so much the more criminal,and the example the more pernicious. Thesebeing my convictions of duty, I shall act upon them.If I am wrong. I am ready to hear any argument onthe other side. But, until convinced to the contrary,I must act, Martin Luther fashion, upon the conclusionsof my own reason and conscience.  But the train of remark which was made above applieshere. According to Mr. it is very innocent for one man to get drunk, butvery wicked for another to speak of it. A man maydraw his inspiration from B, when, in his publicspeeches, he hiccups the praises of God: and from hisfactitious praises of God may got more  ofdollars for the worship of  and this is verywell; but to speak of such an  to a Christianpeople, to seek to  the example of it fromthe young men of our land, and to save the countryfrom having such a stigma blazoned on its front—this, Mr. Felton's morality would lead him to as 'foulest ' Let it be on. We nowknow what Mr. Felton is. Me proves his  inthis case, as he did the  of his mind in theother.           Mr. Felton has much to say above  of'good taste.' His ideas and mine on this dentlty differ so much that we could not  itwith profit; for I hold honesty and truth to be thefirst selements of a correct taste. He charges his opponentswith using 'coarse epithets; and yet in alate letter, his mild and gentlemanly 'vulgar and lying.' After Mr. the exercise of his own mind on  an and  de for the virtue of one and the morality of the other, I have no him. Nothing but the solid halls of can reach him.
