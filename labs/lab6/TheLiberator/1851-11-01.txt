 The President having received intelligence on Mondayfrom the 'U.S. Consul at Matamoras, that a companyof Texans had been organised and merched into Mexico,and that new enlistments were progressing forsimilar purposes, has issued the following Proclamation:— [OFFICAL.]   PROCLAMATION. Whereas, there is reason to believe that a MilitaryExpedition is about to be fitted out in the UnitedStates, for the purpose of invading the Mexican Republic,with which this country is at peace; andwhereas, there is reason to approchand that a portionof the people of this country, regardless of their dutyas good citizens are concernuel or may be indeed totake part in the same; and whereas, such enterprises to degrade the character of the United States,in the opinion of the civilized world, and are expresslyprohibited by law:—  Now therefore I issue this my proclamation, warmingall persons who shall cannot themselves with anysuch enterprse, in violation of the laws ans nationalobligations of the United States, that they will therebysubject themselves to the heavy penalty that isdenounced against such offenders; that is, if theyshould be captured within the jurisdiction of theMexican authorities, they must expect to be tried andpunished according to the laws of Moxion, and willhave no claim to the interposition of this governmentin their behalf. I therefore expect all well disposed citizens, whoahve at heart that reputation of their country, andare animated with a just regard for its laws, its penceand its welfare, to discountenance and by all lawfulmeans prevent, any such enterprise. And I callupon everyu offiver of this government civil or military,to be vigilant in arresting for trial and punishmentevery such offender.

 DEAR FRIEND: EAR RIEND It is with painful and heart-felt feelings that weare called to mourn the early departure of our noblecoadjutor, WILLIAM R. SALISBIURY. After an illnessof soe four weeks, he was the vistim of thegreat destroyer. There should be become fitting tributeto his memory. Oh! that we had words to adequatelydescribe the virtues, the modesty, thegentle and humane qualities of the deceased. Societyl one of its most exemplary membes, thelegal profession in promising student, and humanitya noble heart, a world-wide advocate of the despisedand oppressed. He was liberal in ides, generousin feelings, magnanimous in spirit, and uncompromisingin principle. Having a warm heart for theoppressed and enslaved, he was naturally drawn towardstheir champions and defenders; hence thecause of his being at the Fancuil Hall receptionofGEORGE THOMPSON, where he had to go away withregret and disgust at mob law in Hoston. Time andagain has he gone miles to hear the elequent pleadersof the universal rights of all. He cared nothingfor the ties of party, but arted with that which mostclearly represented the true ideas of reform; alwaysgiving word and vote where they would tell most forfreedom. 'Lon shall we seck his likeness.' Neverdid the truthful words of Longfellow seems so emphaticas now:— ILLIAM ALISBIURY.

 About one hundred of our 'most prominent citines,and among them a number of ladies, visited Auburnyesterday in company with the 'feloms,' to hearthe decision of Judge Conkling. the interest manifestedby our citizens for the subjects of this unjustpresscution must be a course of gratifiention to allconcerned. The porty arrived at Auburn at half past ten o'clockA.M. and immediately proceeded to the CourtHouse. In a few minutes the Judge took his seat onthe bench, and declared his readiness to decide uponthe cases before him. After calling the name of theprisoners, he stated that in order to prevent any futuremisspprechension, he had committed his desition towriting and proceded to read over the procious document. After the reading of the decision, the  bondswere signed and delivered into safe keeping of theDistrict Attemey. They consisted of three bonds. One signed by Alfred  and William H.Soward, for the  of Ira H. Cobs. Thenames of James Davis Moses Sammors, StephenPorter and William Salmon, were included in anotherbond; and those of Prince Jackson, Harrison Allen,and Wm. Thompson, in the third.

 Extract of a letter from HENRY CLAY, dated Ashland,3rd October, 1851, to a numerous Committe inNew York, inviting him to visit that city, and addresa voice of warning to his countrymen:— ENRY LAY It was supposed by the authors and supporters ofthe compromise, in the last Congress, that the adoptionof the series of measures which composed itwould secure the unanimous concurrence of all.Their reasonable hopes were confined to the greatmajority of the people of the United States, andtheir hopes have not been disappointed. Everywhere, north, south, east and west, an immense majorityof the people are satisfied with, or acquiescein,the compromise. This may be confidently assertedin regard to thirteen of the slaveholdingStates, and to thirteen, if not fourteen, of the freeStates in a few of both classes of the States, andin some particular localities, dissatisfaction exists,exhibiting itself, occasionally, in words of great violenceand intemperance; but this feeling is, I trust,where it has most prevailed, gradually yielding toas enlightened sense of public duty. I present arapid survey of the actual state of things, as it appearsto me, both at the North and the South, beginningat the former. Is all that region, there is but one of the variouscompromise measures that is seriously assailed, andthat is the law made, is strict conformity with theConstitution, for the surrender of fugitive from lawfulservice of labor. But the law itself, with twoexceptions, has been every where enforced; oppositionas is constantly abating, and the patriotic obligationsof obeying the Constitution and the laws,made directly or indirectly by the people themselves,a few almost universally recognized and admitted.If in the execution of the law, by the public authority,popular discontent is sometimes manifested, ithas, with the exceptions mentioned, been invariablypresumed, or prevented from obstructing the officersof justice is the performance of their duties. If Ias correctly informed, a great and salutary changehas been made, and is yet in progress, at the North,which authorizes the confident anticipation that reasonand law will finally achieve a noble triumph. The necessity of maintaining and enforcing thatlaw unrepealed, and without any modification thatwould seriously impair its efficiency, must be admittedby the impartial judgment of all candid men.Many of the slaveholding States, and many publicmeetings of the people in them, have deliberatelydeclared that their adherence to the Union dependedupon the preservation of that law, and that its abandonmentwould be the signal of the dissolution ofthe Union. I know that the abolitionists (some ofwhom openly avow I desire to produce that calamitiesevent) and their partizens deny and deride theexistence of any such danger; but men who willnot perceive and own it must be blind to the signsof the times, to the sanctional strife which has unhappyarisen, to the embittered feelings which havebeen excited, as well as to the solemn resolutionof deliberative assemblies, unanimously adopted.Their disregard of the danger, I am apprehension,proceeds more from their desire to continue agitation,which augments it, than from their love ofthe Union itself. You refer, gentleman, to 'resolutions and addressesadopted at conventions lately assembled aroundus, in which we have seen with regret as well asclaim, that the question of adherence to the compromiseis avoided or evaded,' and you justly deprecatethe tendency of these resolutions. I have notbeen in inattentive or indifferent observer of them,and with you I deeply regret their adoption. I wishthat these respectable bodies could have been lessambiguous, and more explicit, in declaring their determinationto acquiesce in, and abide by, a greatmeasure of peace and compromise, which, formingas much in the progress of our country, was intendedto reconcile and restore concord and fraternalfeelings among our divided countrymen. There wasno necessity to reserve a right to discuss, to modifyand to repeal the obnoxious law. Such a rightexisted without any express reservation, not onlyas to that law, but as to all laws and as tothe Constitution itself, which has incorporatedin it the right of amendment, and consequentlythat of discussion. But there are occasions when aspirit of moderation should prompt a forbearance toexercise that right, if more were intended thanmeets the eye, more than to proclaim the theoreticright of discussion, if it were designed to announcethe right of unremitted agitation, to continue thedistrictions the country, and, finally, if possible,to repeal the Fugitive State Law, patriotism and harmonmust condemn the unwise course, as fraughtwith the most mischievous and perilons consequences. But we must make some allowance for humanfrality and moderate pride of opinion. Many personsat the North had avowed an invincible hostilityto the Fugitive Law, and declared their intentionforcibly by to obstruct its execution, and had appenledto a higher law, which, as they contended, was paramountto all human legislation. These ostensiblepositions were wholly irreconcilable with patriotism,or even with the existence of regular governmentitself. Obeying the dictates, it is hoped, ofwiser and purer and more social counsels, the partieswho, under the impulses of passion and fanaticism,had assumed, have now abandoned them, and acknowledgedtheir unquesionable duty to submit tothe law and it is modified or repealed by competentauthority. In descending from the high andperilous ground, which they could not safely occupyto that of conceding the obligation of submissionto the law, we discern, I hope, a just homage to thedictates of civilization, and to the duties of establishgovernment. If they have couped with this properconcession too unless reservation of a rightof circumstances, and insisting upon a repeal orthe amendment of a law to which they had taken anexecution, may we not hope that their purpose wasonly to secure a descent retreat, with a secret andpatriotic determination to forbear from disturbingthat return to harmony and tranquillity, so necessaryto the safety and prosperity of the Union? Should itburn out otherwise, should the reckless spirit of agitationcontinue to disturb and district our country,to array section against section, and to threaten theability of the government, my confidence is unshakenin the great body of our Northern fellow-states,that they will, in due time, and in a rightmanner, apply as appropriate and effectual corrective. 

  at our  a fugitive slave  In of the  slave it Henry is Noble P of  Maryland, from which  To you  in the byof  United C The  nor was thy  onhis way to                        This  out a of his No  to Maryland at a  this        The whole  of with an  as a does  of the Ab were  and  of the abolition in the by their —yet all was  and peaceable.—                During his examination, Mr. P counsel forthe pri, said Judge Conklin. of Western NewYork, had decided that the 10th  of the FugitiveSlave Law applied only to such  as had rredafter the passage of that act.      The Commissioner replied he could not be guidedby any decision of Judge Conklin, as he could notbelieve but that the Judge labored udner a very greatmistake. 

 We present on our first page, the decision of JudgeCooklin, in the case of the Syracuse rioters, in which,other boarding them ever for trial, he administers somevery wholesome advice to higher law rebels and farmers—the more effective, perhaps, as coming froma source which has been supposed to be rather insympathy with Abolitionism. We also present, onthe same page, a pithy charge of Judge Nelson, atAlbany, on the same subject, a copy of which wasrequested for the press by several distinguished membersof the bar, as being eminently appropriate tothe present exigency. It will be noticed that WilliamH. S, who represents the State of NewYork in the Senate of the United States, went balfor all the prisoners, and, if correctly reported bythe Syracuse Journal, (a paper devoted in his interests,)took occasion to remark that he 'did not supposethat such  act could be regarded as a recognitionof the moral obligation of the Fugitive SlaveLaw.' When men who are honored with the highestoffices within the gift of our people, thus wantonlythrow their influence on the side of the rebellion, whatwonder that there should be resistance to the laws,and that the blood of faithful officers should be shedwhile attempting to enforce them. The 'moral'guilt of Seward in this matter appears to us scarcely,if at all loss than that of the prisoners. But hehas violated no positive law, and so will escape thepunishment he deserves. As if to make the affairsupremely ridiculous, as well as wicked, a lot ofSyracuse women, several of them in Bloomer dress,accompanied the prisoners to Auburn, and were invitedby Seward, in company with the prisoners, tohis residence, where they were cordially entertained.The whole motley group, (negroes and all, we presume.)moved in procession. The remarks of theAlbany Register, which we subjoin, on the conductof Governor Seward, are as just as they are severe.—V.Y. Journal of Commerce. WilliamH. S    V.Y. Journal of Commerce. BLOOMERISM AND ABOLITIONISM. When the lattersentiment finds a lodgment in the female bosom,is not unfrequently delights to exhibit itself in theopposite extremities. It was so on the examinationof the Syracuse rioters and rescures, before JudgeConklin. It is said that on the last day, among thecrowd in the court room, were several ladies fromSyracuse, dressed in the Bloomer costume, who createdconsiderable excitement, they being the 'observedof all observers.' One of them was the wifeof Moses Sumner, one of the prisoners. In the afternoon,the Bloomers promenaded the streets escortedby gentlemen.—Albany Argus. LOOMERISM AND BOLITIONISM. Albany Argus. SPUNK! Some thirty or forty ladies—the wives,relatives or intimate friends of those implicated inthe Syracuse rescue—attended the preliminary examinationbefore Judge Conklin. They returnedyesterday. Therew was a gentleman in the cars withthem, whose official position made it incumbent uponhim to take a prominent part in the prosecution. Butthe ladies did not deem this a sufficient excuse. Theyaccordingly got up and signed a request, that hewould seek some other car to ride home in! Norwere they contenet with this.

PUNK Evening Journal. We are credibly informed, that on Monday, whenJudge Conklin delivered his opinion, about a hundredAbolitionisets, from Syracuse and Auburn, composedof men and women, many of the latter inBloomer dresses, were present, and that after Gov.Seward had become bail for the parties bound over,the motley group of males and long and short skirtedfemales, by his invitation, formed a procession andescorted the released prisoners to his house, wherethey were treated to a most gracious and hospitablereception. This conduct on his part, can be regardedin no other light, than as an indirect censure ofthe decision of Judge Conklin, a public expressionof sympathy for persons bound over to answer tothe charge of a criminal offence of no ordinary urpitude,and and approval of the sentiments and principlesof the fanatical group which formed their escort.We deeply regret that a United States Senatorfrom New York, and former chief magistrate ofthe State, should have so far forgotten what is dueto a decent self-respect, to his high position, to publicopinion, and the laws and Constitution of hiscountry, as to take the lead in such a miserable anddegrading exhibition. We allude to the subject ina spirit of sorrow, not of anger—with feelings ofdeep humiliation, and not for the purpose of heapingobloquy upon Gov. Seward. We are sure that oncalm are reflection, his own sense of propriety will leadhim to regret the undignified course in which he indulged,and the pernicious example, which, in whatmust have been an unguarded moment, he has set beforehis fellow citizens. We trust the course ofthose presses, which have so industriously fomentedresistance to the fugitive law, and stirred up sedition,has not his deliberate sanction; that he does not approvethe Syracuse outrage, and seek to protect itsperpetrators from the penalties of the law; thathe would not designedly bring a higher court ofjustice into disrepute, and that least of all does hehold sentiments in common and sympathize with thatdemented crowd whom he invited to his mansion.  For the honor of the city and of the State in whichit is located, we deplore the occurrence of such anexhibition in Auburn, scarcely less than the outrageat Syracuse. We hope that the organs of the exhibitors,will not seize upon the fact that it has ledto such an uncouth scene, as another argument whythe law should not be executed. It would, however,be a piece with the rest of their reasoning. Andmost sincerely do we hope that it will not be repeatedupon invitation of a United States Senatoer.—AlbanyRegister. AlbanyRegister. A few weeks ago, those Northern papers havingabolition tendencies and sympathies were contendinglustily for the right to discuss the Fugitive SlaveLaw. It was conceded to them, and they set aboutpreaching resistance to that law. They stirred upmobs to oppose its execution and treat governmentofficers. In two instances, the law has beenviolently trampled under foot, and high crimes committedagainst the State and national sovereignties.These same presses now claim that the criminal perprashall go unpunished. They have advanceda good ways beyond the right of discussion, theyhave come to treasonable action, and contend for exemptionfrom the pains and penalties incurred by it.They hold that armed and forcible resistance to aU.S. law is not a crime. They denounce everybody who is in favor of punishing it. They are foroverthrowing the existing government, or nullifyingit, and substituting codes of higher law passed atabolition conventions in Syracuse and elsewhere.They cannot bear the restraint of constitutions andacts of Congress, and though belonging to a miserablefaction, have undertaken to subjecet a majority ofthe people of this great Union to the precepts oftheir own perveted consciences.

 The New York tribune comments upon the resultof the late election in Pennsylvania as follows:— 'Well: Pennsylvania has attested her devotion tothe Fugitive Slave Law, and her willingness to dendto any depth of servillity which the Slavery Propagundamay see it to require. If Cuba is to be thenext grab, she is ready to acquience and to rid. Ifare  shreas now Slave States, to be served from whatremains of Mexico this side of the Sierra Madre, areto be put before Cuba, Pennsylvania is ready for that.If now acts of tyranny, even moreatrocious than theFugitive Slave Law, or now Constitutional obstructionsto any exhibition of a sympathy for UniversalFreedom shall be exacted, she will be the foremost tolick the dust from the boots of the Propagandists.Already her Buchanan has bid for the support of thatPropaganda by offering to run the Slave Line of 3630 clear across the Continent; and her Dallas has undertakento outbid him by proposing to amend theFederal Constitution so as to repress future Anti-Slaveryefferts. All this, you are, is intended to puta step to Slavery Agitution! Of course it will do it—or, at all events, it will give a chance of resurrectionto some long-buried politicians, which is equally anobject of patriotis solitude. One way or another, theUnion is bound to be saved.   puta step to Slavery Agitution THE SWAN of AFRICA. A new impulse is about tobe given to the musical furor.

'The Problemof Human Destiny' may be one of difficult solution;but the destiny of such a Doctor of Divinity as Dawey,supposing his last winter's seal for the Union tocontinue, and the New Testament to be not a humbug,is not, we fear, so much a problem to be solved, as a'fixed fact' to be depracated.—True Democrat.'

When here, Mr. Thomopsonneither despined their sympathy nor their money;and it is not a little strange that he should, so soonafter his return to his native land, exert his maguificentoratorical powers in the work of their disparagement.  NationalAnti Slavery Standered.  'the Liberty Porty. It is to hoped, however, that the friends of humanityin England will weigh well the statement andreasonings of Mr. Thompson, before they condemn aParty, the standard-beaver of which is GERITSMITH of Peterboro'—a name that needs the prefixof no adjective to commend it to the love and admirationof Philanthropists throughout the world. ERIT MITH It appears that, at the meeting in Bristol, (of whichMr. Webb furnishes the Standard with an account,)Mr. Mathews, the Free Mission Baptist from theUnited States, look occasion to explain the claimsand merits of the Liberty Party. Mr. Webb says: Standard 'He (Mr. Mathews) was followed by Mr. Thompsonwho took his arguments and statements to picees,and exposed in strong terms, the absurdity and dupllcityof their political enterprise under the name ofAnti-Slavery action, as compared with the onalaughtof the Abolitionists upon the selfshneas and hypocrisywhich form the true corner-stones of the systemof Slavery. He showed that the Liberty Party hasrepesatedly fallen to pices—that it has no principlesof cohosion—that it is liable to all the  bywhich meor policinians are apt to be botrayed fromthe path of truth and consisteney—and that, until thisAmerican people are indoctrinated into a sense of thisan, disgraceful  and folly of Slavery, it is vain toexpect them to logislate upon it. Germison's doctrineis so simple and luminous that he who runs may read,What is, then, to prevent that Liberty Party from puttingforth some exposition of their views that shallrecommend itself, as Garrison's does, to every enlightenedconscience which is ubiased by seet and undimmedby selfishness? I have seen Gerrit Smith's Letterand Lynander Spooner's Treatise. But they areponderous argaments. Who can take them in? EvenFrederisk Douglans's transcond  ability was unableto master them, until he had  for along time at thefeet of the Liberty Party Gamlied; and I fear thatnow, with all his talent and with the help of all theseal that converts feel, he will find it very difficult tocommunicate his convictions to any of those who annot already fascinated by the American passion forpolities. However, although Mr. Mathews is a selousadvocats of the Liberty Party, he will not suceredin convincing many in these parts of the stabilityof its moral foundations, or of the  forwardnessof the assumptions by which it is up. It is difficult to most Englishman to turn theirattention to the complicated political movements ofthe United States, or to make them understand howthey can be made use of to much purpose for theabolition of Slavery, until the nation has been arounedand ealightened to the cuormity of the system.'       New Mr. Thmopson is the last man in the worldwho should 'expouse, in strong term the athurdityand suphieity of the Liberty Party.' It does not well in a member of the British Parliament,who has aworn to support the British constitution,with its anoumalies, and who has  as hard andas long as Mr. Thompson to convince the people ofhis constituency that it was for their interest and politicalwell-being to elect him to that high position,now to deal in the lanugage of self-rigtsous scorntowards politics. athurdity suphieity   elect 'He exposed, in strong learns, the abouridty andduplicity of the Liberty Party.' He did oh? Well!we should like to have heard him. 'The is bad enough. This 'aburdity' is a thing of aman's thinking; but the charge of 'duplissity' sarrieswith it the implication of weakness, hypocrisy,corruption; and the Liberty Party is guilty of neither.'The absurdity and duplicity' of the Liberty Partyin this country, are precisely what 'the abourdityand duplicity' of Mr. Thompson were when heacted with the British Abolitionists for the overthrowof Slavery in the West Indias. The same as whenhe acted with Mesars. Cabden, Bright, Wilson,Thompson, and other distinguished colitioisns in promotingthe election of men to Parliament who werein favor of the Abolition of the corn laws, and wouldvote for none other. 'The absurdity and duplicity'of 'the Liberty Party' are precisely what Mr.Thompson's 'abourdity and duplicity' were whenhis became a 'director of the East India Company,'according to his own showing a most hearthless body.in order that be might reinstate the dethround 'Rajahof Sttars,' and otherwise advance the political interestof India.  'duplissity But, says Mr. Webb; 'He  that the LibertyParty has respestedly fallen to ' If he attemptedto do this, 'he showed' what was not true, sincethere has been no such repeated falling to pices ofthe Liberty Party, as alloged. The resoning whichwould condemn the Liberty Party, because of theapontacy, even of a majority of its members, wouldbe  if applied to 'the American Anti-SlaverySociery' itself for its whole history has been markedby withdrawals, separations, divisions and schismeThe statement that the Liberty Party 'has no principlesof ' is virtually saying that it has nopriciples at all; for, if it have principle held incommon by its members, they form the cohesireband of union; and we think that if the LibertyParty have no other than the principle of humanfreedom to bind it together, it could not be honestlyarrirmed to be destituts of the  Asto the 'liberty to ' to which the LibertyParty is exposed haven help us all including even friends,  and Thompson who if we  have in their was upon the Liberty Partynot only been  have  to the to corve a party at the exposes of the cause ofthe  That an Anti-Slavery moral must  Anti-Slavery  in this country.in  by no men  than by the membersof the Liberty  and to be  told it byMr. Webb, as a  of now light on the  in The  that the Liberty on the  of may be  by themwho know nothing of the  of  will be  where course in more and where testimony to Anti-Slavery truth is moreconsistent, straightforward, and stringent?

Mr. Webb asks, with apparent simplicity, 'what isthat to prevent the Liberty party from paing forthsome exposition of their vise, that shull recommend itselfas Garrison's d, to every entighted conssience,which is urbiased by seat, and unmmed by selfishness?Most incocently put, barring the crookednessof the sentence! We must regret that thereis too great a resenblance in the reception given tothe expositions of the Liberty Party, and that whichhas hitherto attended the exposition of Mr. Garrison.There must be few 'enlightened coniences'left in this unhappy world, if those only are so whoaent entirely to the 'expositions' of Mr. Garrison!'I have seen Garrit Smith's letter,' says Mr. Webb.We should like to know which? for Gervit Smithhas written many letters on the subject of slavery,during the last 18 or 20 years, and if they could allbe collected, they would not fall short of filling upfriend Webb's garret, in Dublin. We are glad thatMr. Webb does not pretend to have read GerritSmith's 'letter;' he only speaks of having 'seen' it.The sight of it was doubtless enough for him. hesaw enough to convince him, that both 'Mr. Smith'sletter and Mr. Spencer's trustine, are ponderous arguments.'We agree with the latter of this conclusion,though we may dissent from its spirit, for webelieve the arguments to be not only weighty, butunannerrable. 'Englishmen' may not be quite asclear in mental vision, as some of us apprehended;still we cannot believe, with Mr. Webb, that it isdifficult to make them understand the necessity andappropriateness of political action in this countryfor the abolition of slavery. Indeed, we found itdifficult to make 'Englishmen' understand howslavery could be otherwise abolished. The philosophyof infusing a correct moral sentiment into thegovernment, by means of voting for good men, andagainst bed once, has been too often advocated inEngland by George Thomson, Esq., M.P., not tobe pretty easily comprehended throughout the realm.If, however, 'Englishmen' need further light uponthat subject, let them attend Mr. Thompson, in oneof his electioneering compaigns through the TowerHamlets, and if they are not then initiated, we shellunite with the haters of England, and call John Bulla stupid fellow!! what isthat to prevent the Liberty party from paing forthsome exposition of their vise, that shull recommend itselfas Garrison's d, to every entighted conssience,which is urbiased by seat, and unmmed by selfishness       enlightened coniences   entirely expositions I have seen Garrit Smith's letter letter seen Mr. Smith'sletter and Mr. Spencer's trustine, are ponderous arguments. unannerrable.

 ACTS xxi. 13: 'I am ready not to be bound only,but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the LordJesus.' CTS Here is another example of the moral hereisonwhich has chamoterined the great reformers of everyage. It is a specimen of the spirit of a devotedfollower of truth—of the intrepidity and firmness withwhich a real lover of Right follows the dictates ofConecience and the voice of Duty. In the instancewhich called forth from Paul the language ofthetext, the entreaties of his friends had no power toperuade him not to go to Jerusalem, although hewas promised bonds and death as a reward for hisI  to elevate man, and free him from the thraldomof error and of sin. In the face of these, hefaltered not; his duty was plain, and like a nobleand heroic man, he followed in its path, regardlessof consequences, declaring as willingness even todie for the name of Christ.     What a coust between the conduct of this noblelover of truth, and many professed followers ofChrist at the present day! Little more than a yearsince, an act passed our national legislature, and receivedthe executive sanction, requiring northernfreeman to vislate the dictates of their conscience—to violate their accord religion—to violate theirhonor and feslinge as men, by denying the rites ofhospitality to those fireing from a system of iniquityand outrage more terrible than death, or by turningblood-hounds to hunt them down, and aid in returningthere to the southern bull of whipe and chains.  What is the manifest duty of the Christian, whencalled upon to obey this law? Shall be acknowledgeits claims as being higher than the claims of the lawof Justion and of Right, or submit from a fear of itspenalties? If so, he possnes not the spirit of thetext.—he is a moral coward, and unworthy the nameof Christian. For the cause of Christ, which is thecause of humanity, he should be willing to suffernot only fines and bonde, but also death.  Temperising priests may tell us that as long asthis is a law of the land, it is over duty as good otineasot obey it; but in so doing, they are guilty ofdark hersey and fearful chery to God! Theirwords are full of falshood and blasphemy, for theyteach that God's claims and laws can be not aridefor a time, and that we most violate them rather thanan constment of corrupt and wicked mon! DidDaniel thus when he was commanded  to call uponhis God? No! he noticed not the dearce of awicked king, notwithstanding the fearful penalty ofthe law. He violated a law of the land! and theministry are loud in commencing his heroism andunfaltering adherence in the cause of truth in no deing;and yet some of than deslam it to be the dutyof good citizens and Christians, to obey a law ofCongress not less tysemisal and wicked than thedecree of Dan     He violated a law of the land   Christina I will ye obey God or man?

 ☞ The following Letters were read at the resentannual meeting of the Pennsylvania A.S. Society. Boston, Oct 4, 1851. MY DEAR FRIEND:—A sudden celd, attended withconsiderable inflammation o the image, (aside fromother considerations,) must deprive was of the pleasersof attending the Annual Meeting of the PennsylvanisAnti-Slavery Society, at West Chester, nextWeek. Whenever may be disappointment felt atmy absence, it cannot be greater than the regret Ifeel at the interposing of any ostacle to prevent mybeing with these whom I have known, loved andhonored, for so many years, as among the earliest,most notiable, most devoted friends of a serrely afflictedand horribly ontraged race. Y EAR RIEND Your Anniversary is to be held at a time of intenseexcitement, under circymstanes peculiarly trying, ina location not vey re from the Christiana tragedy.It cannot fail, therefore, to be an occasion ofthrilling interest and deep solemnity. Whatever maytranspire, I am confident that you all will possessyour souls in patience, nor think it 'strange concerningthe flery trial which is to try you, as though somestrang thing had happened unto you; but rejoice,inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's brings;''committing the keeping of your souls to god inwell-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.' 'For yet alittle while, and the wicked shall not be; but themeek shall inherit the earth. The wicked plottethagainst the just, and gheth upon him with histeeth. The Lord shall laugh at him; for he the thathis day is coming. The wicked have drawn out thesword, and have end their bow, to cast down thepoor and needy, and to slay such as he o upright conversation.Their sword shall enter their own heart,and their bow shall be broken.' 'God is our efugeand strength, a very present help in time of trouble;therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed,and though the mountains be carried into themidst of the sea.'     Truly, 'This is a nation that obeyeth not the voiceof the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction; truthis perished, and is cut off from their mouth. . . .Were they asthamed when they had committed abomination?nay. they were no at all ashamed, neitecould they blush. . . . From the least of themeven unto the greatest of them, evey one is given tocoventenances; and from the prophet even unto thepriest, every one dea ly . . . . They makea man an offende for a word, and lay a mare for himthat reporiveth in the gate, and turn saids the ust fora thing of saught. . . . Their first run to evil,and they make haste to shed immosent blood; warningand destruction are in their paths. . . . Theyall lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man hisbrother with a net. That they may do evil with bothhands earnestly, the prises saeth and the judge for a reward; and the great man, be  hismischievous desire; so they wrap it up. . . . Andhe that departeth from evil, maketh himself a prey.'    Nevertheless, ' Strengthen ye the weak hands, andconfirm the feeble knees. Say unto them that are ofa fearful heart, Be strong, fear not. . . . Hearlessunto me,' asith the Lord, 'ye that know righthe people in whose hearts is my fear; fear yenot the raproach of men, neither be ye afraid of theirrevilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment,and the wo shall not them like wool. I evenI, am he tht comfortheth you. Who art thou,that thou  be afraid of a man that shall die,and the son of man that shall be made as grass;and forgettest the Lord they Maker, that hath stretchedforth the heavens, and laid the foundations of theearth; and hast feared contioually every day becauseof the fary of the oppre, as if he was dy to do.s and where is the fary of the oppere? Thecaptive exile hastsmeth that he may be loosed, andthat he shall not die in the pit, nor tat his breedshould fail. . . . For the oppression of the poor,for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saiththe Lord; I will not him in ty from him that profat him. . . . Say ye not. A confederacy, toall them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy;neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. . . .Sanstify the Lord of hours hiself; and let him he yearfear, and let him be your dread.'          My dear friend, I can  language to retiable, as tie, to controlling, the time, as that which I have quoted from a volume, prodlyheld by this appressive nation in the highest as the inspired word of God, which yetdi, in the most desing moment, all its warnings , examples,  judgments.            More than three millions of our fellow- arecontinually crying for delivered from a ser'one hour of wh,' in the truthful words of TJEFFRESON, 'is fraught with more  than agesof that which our fathern ross in rebellion to oppose.'Their ment demonstration that the guilt of this is llaled.

If the Declaration of  we are sight  we are sight  We may  the world  we have  as to the oppression, these are the words of the devil, not tobe tolerated, but destroyed. Whoever undertakesto enforce them, whether called President, Judge, orCommissioner, ranks himself among the  ofmankind; and must take his place in histoery by theside of such monsters as Caligula, and A compact made at the expense of the rightsand liberties of any portion of the people is 'a entwith death and an agreement with hell; andthat covenant—so runs the promise of God—shall beannulled, and that agreement shall not stand, whenjudgment is laid to the line, and righteousness to theplummet; for the hall shall sweep away the refuge oflies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.—Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation whichkeepeth the truth may enter in. Trust ye in the Lordforever; for in the Lord Jehevah is everlastingstrength. For he bringth down them that dwell onhigh; the lofty city, he layoth it low; he layeth itlow, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to thedust. The foot shall tread it down, even the foot ofthe poor, and the steps of the needy.'     EFFRESON                                           I have just been cursorily reading a work, publishedin London in 1792, entitled, 'Thoughts and Inquiryon the Principles and Tenure of the Revealed andSupreme Law,' with reference to African Slavery,'being humbly submitted to the British Legislature,and to the public in general,' by P.W. HALL. As Ihave never seen a copy of it before, and as itcontains many things (somewhat quaintly expressed)very pertinent to our land and times, I am tempted tooccupy the remainder of my sheet with a few questions:— ALL.

 BOSTON, October 7th, 181. OSTON DEAR FRIEND.—Your letter has just reached me.It is tool late, therefore, to obey its call, ever if ithad been possible for me to do so. I have an exngagementto assist at the dedication of a school-housein my native town, on Friday, and could not be withyou. EAR RIEND. It is now a very trying time with us all. It haslong been plain, that the two Ideas of America—theIdea of Freedom and the Idea of Bondage—were entirelyincompatible; all attempts to unite them mustfail. Peace measures, which seek a compromise betweenthe two, will always turn out measure of war.One of the two must be eradicated. The questionis not merely, 'Shall thee be slavery in one part ofthe nation?' but if it is, then the question is, 'Shallthere be freedom in the other part?' It is not possible.The South cannot keep slavery to itself; theNorth cannot keep freedom to itself. It will passover the borders. The events of the last two yearshave shown to all, with half an eye, what was plainenough before to a clear-sighted man, that slaverymust be uprooted from the South, before our freedomat the North is secure. A great criais has now come. The Federal Governmenthas openly and publicly declared itself infavor of the Idea of Bondage, and hostile to theIdea of Freedom. The President is for slavery; theCabinet is for slavery; the Whig party is for slavery;the Democrats are for slavery; the leading merchants,with few, a very few exceptions, are infavor of slavery; the leading newspapers, politicaland commercial, are in favor of slavery; theleading clergymen, as a general thing, have been trueto the instinct of their class; have sided with money,sided with power, and with the oppressor against theoppressed. I think there are not ten prominent politiciansin the United States that dare lift up theirvoice for freedom; I don't know of five prominentclergyment who do so. In Boston, whose is most traintorotisis honored most. The kidnapper walks unrebukedin our streets; his minister defends the businessof stealing men, does it publicly, in the pulpit ofJesus, and in the nae of God. One of th richestmen in the city is said, on good authority, to be theowner of more than a hundred human beings. Ithink he would be more honored and respected byhis associates, if the fact were known. If he shouldset them all free, he would be honoured less than if eshould sell them to-morrow. The great crime of Dr.Palrey is, that he set free and watched over the fellow-menwhom his father held in bondage. The sinof Horace Mann is only this, that he loves freedomand bates slavery. The offence of Charles Sumneris, only that he believes the first principles of theConstitution of Massachusetts, and of the Declarationof Independence. Even in Massachusetts, the seedof the Puritane, we have but a few men whodare defend the great principles of Eternal Justice.An attempt has been made to convince the peoplethat there is no law above the declarations of Congress;an attempt to establish Atheism as the firstprinciple of government.  Well, my friend, these are hard time; times ofcorruption, evil times. 'He that serveth the Lordbecometh a prey.' Yet I think they are gloriousthese, . I am glad that the crime has come; itwill be over all the sooner. The two Ideas, the falseand the true, are now in open battle; every electionis affected by this anti-slavery movement; we cannoti the question; it is fairly before the people;they see only a little of its extent; the whole will appearin due time. I have no fear for the result.Pennsylvania may recade from the right; even Massachuesettsmay recede; it will be only for a day; theywill both come back to the True and the Right, andgive it their hearty approval, their hearty love. Godwill give it triumph.   I am glad that some black men have been foundat last, who dared to resist violence with powder andall. They are driven back to the elementary instictsof human nature. The law is against them;the Constitution is against them; public opinion isagainst them; and the kidnapper arms to take theirbodies. Men who reverence our thers for throwingBritish Tea into Boston Harbor, and shooting todeath the British soldiers at Lexington and BunkerHill, cannot fail to do honor to negroce who repel violenceby violence, and shoot the kidnappers. Perhapsyou will hang them for treason. I suppose allthat the money, all that the talent, all tht the corruptionof the American Government can do to securethe condemnation of those men, will be done. Ishall not be prised i some of them are hung,said the houses of De and Whigs, and withthe blessings of the clergy on the judicial crime. Butof old time, the blood o the martyrs was the seedof the church, and the crew who made his meal onthe gibbet, was the carrier pigson who bore glad of great joy to these who waited for the consolationwhich Liberty was  to bring.

We wishthe Hungarian patriot could peruse and analyze it beforehis expected arrival in this country; foe, shouldhe came here, his manhood and his principles will beput to a severer test by the Slave Power than theywere in Hungary, under the despotism of Austria. From the N.Y. Independent.   Y ENRY ARAL EECHER. The topic of excitement not a days follow suchother with such rapidity, that we seem to live in adream, in which the most astonishing conjunctionsand the strength objects no longer surprise. Ourpalate is becoming need to high flavers. Nothingless than expenditions, revolutions, would alliances,monster exhibitions, have any power to arrest attention.The unparalleled history of the settlement ofCalifornia, the sudden creation of a fleet of seasteamers,surprising in magnitude the men-of-warto which we used to look up as the very mountains ofthe deep, the disastrous invasion of Cuba, the extralegal tribunals of San Francisco, by which the mobtake the place and functions of organized Justice,while the courts and government, caught in thepopular mesh, hang like skeleton flies in a spider'sweb, swinging in the wind; the escape and gloriousadvent of that most renowned of modern men—Louis Kossuth; these and such like events occuralmost daily. Once it was a thing to be spoken of,if one had doubled the Horn or the Cape; but not itis becoming as common as to go from Broadway intoWall-street. The ship that insure to-day, boundfor Canton, looks into San Francisco, cuts across thePacific, stows its Oolong and Imperial, pierces thehomeward deep with its blade-prow, and is backagain, almost before we have done talking about hersailing. The globe used to have a respctable circumference,in the days of Dutch-built ships. Longvoyages used to be talked about. We might nowalmost as well talk of long voyages in a wash-tub.—Very soon there will be no place where a villain canrun to, unless it be behind the icebergs of the PolarSea. Deserts are steadily encroached upon peered intoa little and a little further every year. And InteriorAfrica will soon be familiar whistling-ground toYankee traders, who will whittle from the Cape ofGood Hope straight through to the Nile or to Algiers!After that, there will be no place left in theworld where a man can lose himself—unless he joinsome Union Safety Committee. A man can scarcelybe found there. The topics of the morning, over a dish of coffee,are no longer the weather, the crops, the upsettingof a coach, or a sneaking burglary or two. We noweagerly count up how many scores were smashed upin the last railroad collision, and how many blowntip in the last capitally executed steamboat explosion.It is a matter of infinite pleasure to us alwaysto learn, on such occasions, that 'no one wasto blame, and that the 'utmost care was taken' bythe engineers and conductors. For, if one has acquaintances.in the calamity, it is a gratification toknow that their disaster was a fate, and not a carelessaccident; and that they died honorably by alaw of nature, not by the neglect of a stupid conductoror a drunken captain. scores fate Then, too, we sup upon no wishy-washy highwayrobberies; we effect hearty murders, and capitalhangings,—especially if the rope breaks. By theway, ought not the government to appoint a commissionon Hemp? We remember that Daniel Webstervery significantly assured the gentlemen of theSenate, we think it was, that the operation of pullinghemp, with nothing to stand on, was very inconvenient.But lately, we observe that the cords whichGovernment selects are so economically manufactured,that men find somethmg to stand on quite unexpectedly,and have to be twice hung before theyare once killed. This is not an impertinent intermeddlingon our part. We claim to have a personalinterest in this matter of hanging. Daniel Websterhas most emphatically declared that resistance to theFugitive Slave Law is treason. Judge Kane ofPennaslvania has charged the jury that the extemporaneousresistance of fugitives and their compeersto civil process waa treason. President Fillmore hassent Marshals with patriotic celerity to Syracuse, toarraign for treason all who aided and abetted therendering of a man to his liberty. Now it is quite plain that treason is to be plentiful.The prospect of harvest were never better.—We have felt the symptoms of ripeness ourselves.And as treason is a capital offence, and brings a manto hanging, it is plain that the Government has workon hand for a while to come. Every candidate forsuch honors, therefore, has a right, we think, to insistupon it that, if the Government will hang oneman for helping another to liberty, they shall atleast provide good hemp. It is against the law totry a man twice for the same offence. But ourhangmen sometimes try a fellow twice or three timesbefore they succeed. We have prejudices againstbeing hung with rotten cord. This Southern hempis not strong enough to hold the Union together, ifit is not strong enough to have weight of onetraitor. Why not drop heap entirely, (as it dropsits victims,) and try cotton? Cotton politics andcotton theology have caught the wind as well ascotton sails. Why not cotton cordage ? If cottoncordage is half as good for hanging traitors as cottontheology and cotton patriotism are for makingthem, hemp ought to be suspended. Won't theUnion Committee lry it? if Some of them, who havebeen the most intimate with cotton, have suspended;but ought they not to hang in suspense? If anyof them have a mind to try it, we will intercede forthe other conveniences requisite, so that they shallbe at no expense. But every consideration requiresthat they should use cotton. Judges tried hemp, andthe rope broke. We trust that they will so far deviatefrom his interesting experiment of selling hismaster at a bargain, as not to throw away the thirtypieces of silver, and not to try hemp. Give us themoney for the relief of fugitive slaves, and takegood cotton for haltess! and, if they love their country,do let them take cotton that won't break! treason try lry it have cotton. not us cotton do break! As for ourselves, while we regard robbery and ordinarymurder as in bad taste, we begin to have apenchent for treason. That is getting to be a gentlemanlyaffair. There are our ancestral traitors—Adams,Warren, Jay, Washington, and others, whom theBritish Government, at one time, was as intent uponhanging, as our friends at Washington now ar uponhanging Christiana and Syracuse traitors. ThusPoland has had multitudes of traitors, and theCzar of Russia has tucked them away by hundredsunder the snow-wreaths of Siberia! We recollectsome few historic names of eminent traitors in England,in the days of the struggle of men for liberty.Italy has her traitors, too, Achilli, Massisi and others.And Austria—why, she has  and nationof Union! She exports them. All England is a gogjust now at the arrival of the world's most illustriousmodern traitor, Louis Kossuth! And he goes from hisden at Katahyia is a steam-frigate of this traitor-huttinggovernment of the United States! What—importing  Will it not interfere with homemanufacture?

Now, let us suppose that Committee of clergymenshould be deputed to wait upon the illustriousexile (whose traitorous effigy has just been halteredand hung at home!) Of course, we should selectthose who have most pointedly in againstthe doctrine of the Higher Law. dr. Dewsy,Dr. Taylor, Dr. Spencer, Dr. Spring, Dr. Lord—could a better committee be desired?  During the quarantine of two das, which ourGovernment has ordered at Sh Island, we mayimagine thus it is the purpose of our excellent to  away all inward  of reason, aswell as outward contaminations of plague, from the illustriousexile. We will imagine that the days are tobe divided between the Church and the State. Ourclerical committee would without doubt cast a shadeof awe over the  hero, as they marched intothe cabin of the steam frigate MISSISSIPPI—(theState of repudiation and Senator Foote!)—each onebearing a presentation copy of his cermon or speechon the Fugitive Slave Law. The oldest clergymannow approaches Kossuth, and welcomes him to thisland of liberty and equality. Its blessings are described;the statistics of our prosperity are brieflygiven. 'All these things,' says the excellent spokesman,'we owe under God to our liberty. No peoplecan thrive while ground by oppression.' This lappylaudation of liberty being done, the gentlemenproceed to question his notions of law and government,patriotism and treason.       ISSISSIPPI 'Does your Excellency believe that Slavery is asin per as? Do you not regard it as a patriachalinstitution tolerated by Jehovah, not abrogated byChrist, and if properly used, a beneficent arrangementfor the blacks?' per as M. Kossuth (being perhaps more used lately to thesword than to theology) may be supposed to be alittle confused, and rather evades so unsavery acatechism. But our good divines are too expert in examiningcandidates in theology in all the nice distinctionsinto which the Trueth has been split up, to be easilydodged. And so Dr. S. says plainly, 'Would you,sir, if by uttering the prayer for it, you could releaseevery slave in America, to-morrow, dare to utter sucha prayer?' 'That I should very quickly,' responds the illustriouscatechmen, a little off his guard by the directnessof the question. The Divines nudge eachother. There is business on hand.  'Do you believe that a slave has a right to runaway from his master?' 'Do you mean to inquire by this question, gentlemen,whether I have done right in running awayfrom the service of the Emperor of Austria?' 'No, sir, oh no. You are a white man. Perhapswe ought to put the question a little more explicitly.Do you believe a black man held to slavery inSouth Carolina, has any right to run away?' The English tongue being yet a little new, Mr.Kossuth does not exactly know what South Carolinais, (an ignorance, perhaps, of which her own citizenssomewhat partake,) and supposing that it is the nameof some prison or government galley, answers, that'if a man is imprisoned for crime, he thinks he oughtto work his sentence out, whether he is white orblack.' South Carolina 'Do you think when a man is flying for his liberty,that any one has a right to help him off?' 'Oh certainly I do. I quite agree with your Government,gentlemen, who have kindly provided methis noble steamer wherewith to escape the Emperorof Austria.' 'But do you think, if a fugitive is arrested, that itis right for men to conspire together for his release,against the express laws of his native land?' 'Ah, gentlemen, you are quite familiar with mycase. I perceive that you allude to my extraditionfrom Kutahyia, against the edict of the Emperor ofAustria! I quite agree with you, gentlemen, thatthe Turks did a noble thing.' By this time, he venerated doctors whisper a momentin consultation, and conclude to leave a copyeach of their sermons and addresses in favor of obeyingthe Fugitive Slave law, and to turn down leavesupon the most salutary passages; such as this in Dr.Lord's sermon ('Union Safety Committee' edition,p. 6.) 'To plead a Higher law to justify disobedienceto a human law, the subject-matter of which is withinthe cognizance of the State, is to reject the authorityof God himself, who has committed to Governmentsthe power and authority which t hey exercisein civil affairs.' As a slave is by our lawas defined tobe a chattel, to be completely in the power of hismaster; as our laws give to the master the right totreat his female slaves as he will; to separate families,sell the children in one direction and the parentsin the other; as our civil laws protect the masterin the right of sending his own blood to marketmingled with his slaves, — it is not strange thatKossouth, on reading the passage, quite failed to seeits practical drift, and thought that it was a hint tohim to be an obedient citizen when he should havesettled down. chattel Dr. Spencer called his attention by a dog's-caredleaf to the doctrine (on page 7,) A man has noright to  away his life for a mere sentiment,and leave his wife a widow, or his gray-haired parentswithout a son to solace them.' This is a partof the statement, that citizens have no right to resistGovernment until there is a good prospecet of success.Upon this passage Ko ponders; and ashe walks up and down his now deserted cabin, hesoliloquize: 'As if the greatest achievements of theworld were not in their inception gloomy and cheerlessto all usual methods of estimation. It is theheart determined to die—it is that courage whichcries out, "Give me liberty or give me death"; itis that nobleness of nature that  to acceptlife as a burden of disgrace, and  to lay itdowness as a sacrifice to liberty; is short, it is thatsublime and heroic determination of great souls tovindicate man's manhood, living or dying, that overgiven success!

Onegentleman thought it would be policy to say so muchof Kocouth that nobody would think of them. TheSecretary of the Navy was of opinion, that statesmenand their principles were like ships and theirarmament; there must be a act for each side, besidesa few revolving gu set in the middle, and turningwith equal facility in every direction.   The Secretary of the Army thought it a plaincase. 'A stateman's read principles are mere heavyartillery, stocked in form, and never to be  unlessthe enemy attacked the fort. But then therewas another act of principles to be used in the field—light horse, skishore, and flying artillery.Now, gentlemen, I take it that Conscienos andRight, and that sort of armament, are heavy gunsnot to be used twise in a century. But obedienceto law, and patriotiem, and the duty of all citizens tokeep the compremises, these are light artillery dochingabout here and there, wheeling, twisting, firingor retreating, just as the exigency of the field requires."   The Secretary of the Treasory 'was of opinionthat the case was difficult only in theory. In preotios,he apprehended the thing might be aporatedsuccessfully. You see, gentlemen, just now, thatconscience, and old-fashioned patriotiam, and higherlaw, are non-interest paying stocks, and our fancydoctrines rule the market. A few outsiders have investedlargely in the old securities; but I thinkwe have cornered them. There never was a nimblermarket for fancies than now. Just combine, givethe old stocks another push down, rush the fanciesa notch or two up, and then, just before the reactioncomes, why, we'll sell out, and make a cleanprofit on the speculation.' preotios The Secretary of State, who had looked remarkablyheavy at the announcement of the business,gradually cheered up as these counselors proceeded,and by the time that the dozen bottles had beenuncorked, he was ready. 'Gentlemen, union is indispeneablein such a case as this. If I have beenable to render some slight service to my country informer days, I shall not be found wanting in such acrisis. This country must be saved. We musttherefore praise Kossuth, and praise America, andpraise liberty, and say as little about principle aspossible. Gentlemen, I have throughly exploredthis whole question. It is quite possible for us totake both sides, and to use both sides. We mustbelieve in liberty. We must believe in governmenttoo. Men have rights; but so have masters. Monmust obey their consciences; but they must obeythe laws too. If there is any disagreement betweenthese things, it is not for us to go into such abstructions.it is mere metaphysics.

 G. Thompson,R.D. Webb, F. Douglass,And the Liberty Party. The Article on our first page, from the pen ofFrederick Douglas, entitled 'R.D. Webb, GeorgeThompson, and the Liberty Party,' is one we have copied with great reluctance, and read with unfeignedregret. Since our friend Douglass avowed his lackof unity with the American Anti Slavery Society, inregard to political action under the present Constitutionof the United States, he has seemed to us tobe extremely sensitive to criticism, less courteous inmanner, less serene in spirit. It may not appear soto others, and perhaps we are mistaken. Far be itfrom us to say or to aught that shall causelessly leadto any personal provocation. Though, during the lastsix months, we have seen in 'Frederick Douglass'sPaper,' (we wish the paper had a title,) various sentimentsand doctrines which we have regarded as decidedlyobjectionable, we have carefully abstainedfrom animadverting upon them, in order to avoideven the appearance of controversy with one in whosewelfare and progress we have for many years takenso deep an interest, and whose change of position indicates,thus far, we think as marked a change in the tone and temper of his mind. But we feel constrained,however reluctantly, in fairness to copy and infrankness to comment upon his strictures relating toour transatlantic coadjutors, GEORGE THOMPSON andRICHARD D. WEBB. EORGE HOMPSON ICHARD EBB. Considering the intimate friendship whch has subsistedbetween himself and these estimable men, himarticle is offensively sarcastic and contemptuous; andthe insinuations contained in it are such as, in a lessexcited state of mind, we are confident he will sincerelyregret. 'What private griefs these gentlemenhave, alas I was know pot' is a reflection not calledfor by any thing in the character or conduct, anythingor writings of these gentlemen, whose views of thephilosophy and mode of carrying on the anti-slaveryconflict in this country have not experienced anychange. To say that 'they have not only beentempted, but have yielded to the trumptation to servea party, at the expense of the cause of the slave,' is toimpeach their integrifts, while exhibiting surprise andindignation at what is pronounced an unmerited censureon their part. The impuation on the candor ofR.D. Webb, that 'the sight of Gerrit Smith's letterwas doubtlesss enough for him,' may answer for afling, but is wholly underserved; for, nect to GeorgeThompson, we doubt whether there is one, on theother side of the Atlantic, who reads more attentively,examines more candidly, or decides more cauiously,touching every phase of the struggle in the UnitedStates for the abolition of slavery, than Richard D.Webb. For Gerrit Smith, we are sure, Mr. Webbcherishes a high regard as a fearless reformer and anoble philanthropist; and he would not willingly allowany thing from the lips or pen of Mr. S. especiallytouching the duties of abolitionists, to escaps hisperusal. 'We are glad,' says Mr. Douglass, 'that Mr.Webb does not pretend to have read Gerriit Smith'sletter; he obly seaks of having seen it.' Mr. Webbresorts to no quibbling, and we are confident neverdreamed that such a construction would be put uponthe word 'seen,' especially by an old friend, as to implyunfairness of treatment and cowardice of mindtowards Mr. Smith or the Liberty Party. sight read seen There are several fings at Mr. Thompson, in thearticle we are reviewing, which will greatly delihtthe enemies of the anti-slavery cause. (1.) Of theLiberty Party, Mr. Douglass says—'When here, Mr.Thompson neither despised their sympathy nor theirmoney.' When here, Mr. Thompson sought for himselfneither 'sympathy' nor 'money,' from any quarter,though profoundly greateful for any manifestationof kindness shown to him as a man, 'who would notflatter Neptune for his trident, nor Jove for his powerto thunder.' With his life in constant peril, hegave himself with Christian her to the cause offree speech and the millions who are perisiring intheir chains, asking for no remuncration, and keepingnothing in the back-ground. Every where, he avowedhis adhesion to the American Anti-Slavery Society;his confidence in the soundness of its principlesand te vitality of its position; his disturb of everyother plan or mode of operation for the oblition ofslvery. He was eminently discriminating as to thepolitical parties, and every dispeased to bestow creditwhere it could fairly be given; but he clearly saw,and constantly declared, that to none of them couldsafely be untrusted the management of the anti-slaveryenterprise. Whatever pocuniary assistance he received,therefore, was given voluntarily, and with afull knowledge of his actual sentiments and position.If any friends of the Liberty Party were led to contributeto his necessities, in the hope or expectationthat he could be bed into silence respecting thefallacy or the impoteney of its position, (a suppositionwe will not cherish for a moment,) they greatly mistookthe man. (2.) (1.)   (2.) 'Mr. Thompson is the last person in the world, whoshould' 'expose, in strong terms, the abourdity andduplicity' of the Liberty Party.' What does this imply,but that Mr. Thompson's career has been so signallymarked by absurdity and duplicity, that he should be'the last man in the world' to talk of the abaurdityand duplicity of others? In this F.D.'s present estimateof G.T.? last 'It does not look well in a member of the BritishParliament, who has sworn to support the BritishConstitution, with its anomulies,' &c. Will our friendsDouglass tell us when that Constitution was adopted—point to its various sactions and articles—exhibit itsanomalous features, &c. &c., that we may see whatanalogy there is between it and the American Constitution?and whether there is any ground for theimputation, that G.T., after seeking his own electionto Parliament, 'now dels in the language of self-rightness scorntowards politics'? In swearing to supportthe American Constitution, G.T. believes everymember of Congress agree to sustain a pro-slaverycompact; and therefore, no abolitionist can consistentlyfill that office himself, or elect another to fill it.Does G. t., by becoming a member of the BritishHouse of Commons, consciously or actually compromisethe priniples of justice, or swear to do thatwhich he believes is a sin against God? If so, let himbe rebuked for his inconsistency. self-rightness scorn When Mr. Thompson, in his speech at Bristol,spoke of the Liberty Party in this country, we are confidentit was not in the narrow and restricted sensein which Mr. Douglass chooses to understand him.—In England, what is known of the Gerrit Smith LibertyParty! How many in this country know of its existence? Its rank and file scarcely number a baker'sdozen. In a political estimate, it is absurd and ludicrous.Out of central New York beyond the intakean interest in its success? Beyond that particularsection, when or where have meetings been heldby its adherents, as a proof that they exist? Mr.Thompson took a broad survey of the field of politicalaction; and by the term 'Liberty Party,' comprehendedin his indictment, the original Liberty Party, whichafterwards became transformed to Free Soilism, Barnburnerism,and now Coalition, or 'Truck and Dicker'Party; It was in this view that be 'slowed that theLiberty Party has repestedly fallen to pises—thatit has no principle of sohecsion—and 'that it is liableto all the temptations by which mere politicians areapt to be betrayed from the path of truth and consistency.'In all this, he was morally and philosophicallycorrect. It has always struck us, as something extermlycool and complacent, for the few individus is centralNew York, who style themselves the LibertyParty, to ansume to be the vertiable Liberty Partythat was organised ten years ago; and that they remaintrue to the platform which was than laid downan the basis of political action, when the train athey have etablished been and multiplied objects tobe obtained, as a combination, never contemplated bythe old party. They give a construction to the U.S. Constitution,warranted by nothing in the historyof its formation, or in the character of the American people—absurdly insisting that it is an anti-slavery,and not a pro-salvery insturament, and that it was designedto secure the freedom to every human being tothe American soil, although adopted by a slaveholder,slave breeding and slave trading nation, which athis hour, is united is nothing as much as in keepingthre millions of the inhabitiants in chattel slavery!

 Deep anguish reigns within my breast,Dear countrym for thou art not free A plague- rests upon dry The stain of Negro Slavery!       Thy stripes are black, thy stars gone out,Thy freedom but a mocking jest:What are they Senators about.With such a load of shame to rest?    What! are they sunk to coward knaves,That revel in disgrace and shame?Are we become such fallen slaves,That we cannot redeem our name!    Let us not sit down teame and coldlyWhile there's a wrong or galling chain;But up! and seek redemption boldly.And wipe out every spot and stain!    Let us proclaim, ALL MEN ARE FREE,And banish sorrow, care and pain,—Abolish all of Slavery,And then our stars will shine again:—   But not will we've fulfill'd our trust,And that unto the very letter;Freed our good weapon from its rust,And with it sundered every fetter.    Then tell the word, we are a nation'That means to do the thing that's right,'And occupy our proper station,With 'stars and stripes' all clear and bright.   W.J.W. 

 To JAMES HAUGHTON, Dublin, Ireland: AMES AUGHTON DEAR JAMES,—Crime is hated and punished till itreaches a certain magnitute; then it ceases to be acrime, and receives no punishment, but, on the contrary,becomes a great social virtue, to be honoured andrewarded. Thus it is in war. Kill ONE man, andyou are hung as a murderer; kill ten thousand, andyou are a hero, a saint, like Washington or a Wellington;and instead of being hung, you are made aPresident, a king, to rule over men. Such it is here.Steal a man's hat, and you are cast, out as a mean,despicable thief; steal the man, hat, shoes, coat andall, and the despised thief instantly becomes, theHonorable Henry Clay, or the Honorable Daniel Webster,to be honored and idolized by all good Christiansand citizens. EAR AMES man Honorable So, tell some little, mean, cowardly lie, and Americans,in Church and State, would cry out against youmost lustily, as if meanness and lying, were aborrentto their nature; but tell a huge, brazen, beld lie,such as they tell who say that a nation holding threemillion slaves and passing the Future Law, andgiving political power to men in proportion to themember of their slaves, is the 'land of the free,' 'theasylum of the oppressed.' and you are counted a sincereChristian and patriot, worthy to be a priest and aPresident. Unblushingly affirm it to be a self-evident truththat God made all men free, and then that he madesome slaves; boldly assert that your aim is 'to establishjustice,' and then turn round and brand menwith infamy, drive them from your presence, andhate and persecute them on account of their complexsion;declare that yours is the home of the brave,and then rob cradles and nurseries of their helplessinmates, sell them as beasts, and scourge mothers,wives, sisters and daughters; proclaim yourself theprotector of the weak and defencies, and then despite,trample on and insult the helpless and thedumb; without a blush assert your country to be theasylum of the oppressed, and then start off, like abloodhound, on the track of a fugitive slave; assertthat you love and adore God, and then sell Him, inhis likeness, with swine; do all these things, and tenthousand others like them, and then are you worthyto be received to the fellowship of Americans as a goodAmerican citizen and Christian. I doubt if youwould be either. You were born in Ireland; nonebut a native-born American can ever attain to thatperfection in lying and hypocrisy which is necessaryto meet the exigencies of this age and nation. all you But a few nights ago, I had a speciment of genuineAmerican lying and hypocrisy, all under the formand sancitity of Quakerism. I held a meeting in aplace called Mr. Etna, in a neighboring county of thisState. I was commenting on the Fugitive Law andthe new Constitution of Indiana. I said that thosewho voted for, and would help execute, the FugitiveLaw, or the 13th Article of the new Constitution,were worse than common thieves, robbers, or murderersand ought to be held and treated. As wellknown, rich Quaker—BENJAMIN SATTERTHWAITE—sprang to the floor, and declared that he was inspiredof God to help execute the Fugitive Law and to votefor the Exclusion Article of the Constitution, and thatGod directed him to return fugitive slaves, and toexclude colored people from the State; that God inspiredhim to say that slavery was right and abolitionwrong;, that because this is the asylum of the oppressed,we ought to help keep the slaves in theirpresent condition, put them down when they attemptto rise, and return them back if they attempt to runaway. He solemnly affirmed that his heart was fullof Christ and of God, and of love for all men, andthat it was this fact that made him stand up againstabolition, and in favor of slavery. ENJAMIN ATTERTHWAITE I allude to this as a speciment of American Christianityand Demacracy. That man is a member ofthe Friends' Society and the Democratic party; andthe churches and political parties of this nation aremade up of just such spirits, as a general thing.The great body of the priests and politicians, of theChristians and citizens of Indiana, voted to drive coloredpeople and fugitive slaves from the State, and topunish as felons those who harbor or employ them.The great mass of the Christians and citizens of the theNorthern States go for punishing men as felons forescaping from slavery to liberty, and for attemptingto rise from the condition of brutes to that of men,and all who shall dare to help them. Like the Rev.Dr. Dewey, would consign their own wivesand mothers, their own daughters and sisters, to thepollutions of slavery, to perpetuate their gloriousUnion with slave-breeders and slave-hunters, withthieves, adulterers and kidnappers. This is the way in which Americans 'establishjustice perpetuate liberty, and worship their God.Dear friend, it seems to me of infinite moment to theprogress of mankind in liberty, in peace, in temperance,in justice, goodness and truth, and in all that it goodand great, that the nations of Europe should be madeto know just what Liberty, Republicanism, Christianity,Christ and God mean in the mouths of Americans.The names of Europe are moved, and thosedo greatly err who mark the future by the temporarytriumph of your armed legions in favor of despotism,over the brute force of the masses, undisciplinedand ignorant. The true friends of liberty and progressfeel the strugglings, the unheavings and tossingof the great European ocean of mind. The triumphsof your armed despots are but the bubbles,the froth, the scum on the surface of those deep waters.That ocean of mind is instinct with life; it isrestless; it is tossing to and fro; it will soon leapover its ancienet landmarks, and swoep over yourthrones, crowns and sceptres, your royalty and yourloyalty; your monarchies, your aristocracies, andyour oligarchies. What is to rise on their ruins?We know not; but, pray the God of nations, (if youknow such God; I don't; the God I worship beingonly the God and Governor of individual man;)that no Republic may ever rise there after the modelor the American Republic—the last great experimentof such a government. God grant it may be the last!for of all earth's despositions, none have ever been socruel, as mean, so injust, so inhuman, so oppresive,so full of all lying, hyporcrisy, and malignity, as thatwhich exists under the name and form of the AMERICANUNION. It is indeed 'a covenant with death, anagrument with hell.' individual God grant it may be the last! MERICAN NION. a covenant with death, anagrument with hell. Therefore, dear James, warn the people of Europe,struggling for freedom, against looking to this nationas a model. To open their eyes, print and circulatethe extracts, in my two last, from the Constitutionof Indiana. They are a true index to the liberty, thecharacter, the government, the religion and God ofthis nation. HENRY C. WRIGHT. 

 THE PRISONERS OF NAPLES*BY JOHN G. WHITTIER. * I have been thinking of the victims boundIn Naples, dying for the lack of airAnd sunshine, in their cold, damp cells of pain—Where hope is not, and innocence in vainAppeals against the torture and the chain—Unfortunate! whose crime it was to shareOur common love of freedom, and to dare,In its behalf, Rome's hariot, triple-crowned,And her base pander, the most hateful thing,Who, upon Christian or on Pagan ground,Makes vile the old heroic name of king.Oh, God most merciful! Father, juset and kind!Whom man hath bound, let Thy right hand unbind;Or, if Thy purposes of good behindTheir ills lie hidden, let the sufferers findStrong consolations; leave them not to doubtThy providential care, nor yet withoutThe hope which all Thy attributes inspire,That not in vain the martyr's robe of fireIs worn, nor the sad prisoner's fretting chain;Since all who suffer for thy truth send forth,Electrical, with every throb of pain,Unquenchable sparks, Thy own baptismal rainOf fire and spirit over all the earth,Making the dead in slavery live again.Let this great hope be with them, as they Shut from the light, the greenness, and the sky,From the cool waters and the pleasant breeze,The smell of flowers, and shade of summer trees,Bound with the felon lepers, whom diseaseAnd sins abhorred make loathsome; let them sharePco's faith, Foreste's strength to bearYears of uable torment, stern and still,As the chained Titan victor through his will!Comfort them with Thy future: Let them seeThe day-dawn of Italian liberty;For that, with all good things, is hid with Thee,And, perfecet in Thy thought, awaits its time to be!                                         I, who have spoken for freedom at the costOf some weak friendships, for some paltry prizeOf name or place, and, more than I have lost, gained in wider reach of sympathies,And free communion with the good and wise.May God forbid that I should ever boast easy self-denial, or repineThat the strong pulse of health no more is mine;That, overworn at noonday, I must yieldTo other hands the gleaning of the field—A tired on-looker through the day's decline.For,  beyond deserving  and knowingThat kindly Providence its care is showingIn the withdrawal as in the bestowing.Scarcely I dare for more or less the Beautiful yet for me this autumn day on its sunset hills; and, far away,For me the Ocean lifts its solemn psalm,To me the pine woods whisper, and for meYou river, winding through its vales of calm,By greatest books, with  purple-starred,And  bloom, and golden-rod made gay,Flows down in silent gladness to the sea,Like a pure spirit to its great reward!Nor lack I friends, long-tried and near and dear,Whose love is round me like an atmosphere,Warm, soft, and golden. For such gifts to me,What shall I render, oh my God! to thee?Let me not dwell upon my lighter shareOf pain and ill that human life must hear;Save me from selfish pining; let my heart,Drawn from itself, in sympathy, forgetThe bitter longings of a vain regret,The anguish of its own peculiar smart;Remembering others, as I have to-day,In their great sorrows, let me live, alway,Not for myself alone, but have a part,Such as a frail and erring spirit may,In love which is of Thee, and which indeed Thouart!                                                * The recent publication of W.E.

 To S.S. FOSTER:— OSTER Some time since, I saw in the Liberator an accountof a speech made by you an anti-slavery meetingsomewhere in Massachusetts, in which it was said youshowed that refusing to vote was much more likely toresult in the abolition of slavery, than voting wouldbe. For several years, I have belonged to the VotingAnti-Slavery Party, believing, as I did, that it wouldprove the most effectual instrumentality for banishingthat evil from the country. Now, I should be pleased to see, in the Liberator,the process of reasoning by which you arrive at adifferent conclusion. I presume the Editor will grantyou the requisite space. The Editor has my name,which you can have by calling on him, if you considerit of any consequence. INQUIRER.

 DEAR GARRISON: EAR ARRISON It is said there are certain  in theStates, who make wanden ne to sell. honestlyif they can, but at all evens to sell; and the businessof the makers is to make land professions ofhigh honer, to effect independance, and to give   'The age and body of the time its form and presure,in such manner as shall bu their megs. We havea paper here which has been called the leading nalof Kurope—not that it lly leads the publicmind, but it is supposed to sell the greatest number,and, under that impression, is obtains an immenumber of advertisements, and a very large income.It does not lead, but is skillful in noting the coursewhich the public mind is likely to take; it sees whatwind is coming on to blow, and indicates it by trimmingits sails accordingly. It does this with extraordinarypre-vision, skill and test; but it has so invariablydone this in reference to what will sell, thatmen now deem it a political index of those movementsthat are about to become facts. They gather,print and publish news as tradesmen; and we oughtto judge, and most men to judge them, as other tradesmen;but they make such large professions, that menare apt to forget, and many do forget, that their loudprofession is but sounding brass. However, theirwriters are long-sighted, keen observers, and they see,or think they see, that the kings in Burope are overdoingit, and they are turning against their protagè.the Emperor of Austria. It had so grossly praisedand patronised, softened and apologised for all the crueitiesand wickedness of the Austrians in the Hungarianwar, that it had obtained the bad name of theAustrian Gaxette, and this name had begun to stickso closely to the journal, that they have seized the opportunityof the Austrian Emperor declaring himselfabsolute and despotic, to begin to turn round and cattheir teachings.      protagè.  I send you the paper of the 11th September, thatyou may take that article (page 4) as an index ofwhat is predicted by experienced pilots of the probablefuture of Europe, and give it to your readers, ifyou please. You will also see in the same paper thewretched state of things at Good Hope. This comes of the lust for patrenage in our aristoccy.If they would be content to allow men to governthemselves, instead of insisting upon governingthem so many thousand miles off, and that too throughmilitary governors, who know but little of socialneeds and constitutional principles, and of whom thepeople here know very little, and the people thereknow nothing until they are required to call them'Excellency,' and render them obedience.  Remember that we poor English are ground downto pay for the blood and waste, violence and injustice,which men are there made to commit. Sir HarrySmith, our Governor, is a great boaster, and vainof the power he has. Observe in the paper I send you the following articlerelative to the condust of the king of Prussia:— GERMANY. The king of Prussia has taken Hanover,Frankfort and Cologne, on his journey to Hohenzollern,He is accompanied by manteuffel, who heldinterviews with the Hanoverian minsiters, while hasmaster visited the king. At Frankfort-on-the-Maine,he reviewed the troops in the Rossmarkt, a large opensquare—the very spot on which the inhabitants of thatand many neighboring cities had often listened to theorations of Gagern, and the other heroes of the GermanParliament. His Majesty could scarcely have beenoblivious of these associations, and the people certainlywere not—for not a choer was heard, scarcely a hatraised. At Cologne, he went to the cathedral, wherehe was recieved by the Catholic clergy in pontificalibus,and affably conversed with them for a considerabletime. But when the burgomaster and the municipalauthorities waited upon him, and made a speech ofwelcome, he told them, in the style of our James I.,'He did not come to make compliments, but to speakthe truth, and the whole truth.' 'But I know,' saidhe, 'that you are very ticklish and particular aboutyour press; but this hallucination must needs end.for it hinders considence and attachment, and excitesdiscord in town and country. You must try to banishthis fiend-like spirit, that things may go better.I fully agree with what my brother William (thePrince of Prussia) has told you, and say seventytimes, and again seventy times, 'Amen,' to it. Itis high time you did away with these things; otherwise,I will; for I have the mind and the power todo it. See to it, in order to improve, and the soonerthe better; else we shall not remain good friends; for,I assure you, the severest measures will be taken.' Atother towns in the Rhenish provinces, the Catholicclergy were caressed, the Protestants and the citizensanubbed or lectured. ERMANY. in pontificalibus the severest measures will be taken. These things are treasuring up wrath to the day ofjudgment. Every one feels here, and on the Continent too, theuncertainty of things as they now are. There hasbeen no settlement, but simply a resction; the tidewill flow again; the people will be uppermost, andwith a feeling that things are not to be hushed. Thequestion will be, I fear, when their day comes,—andit will not be long first,—decapitation, deportation,or incurceration. Our Government, as you well know, is in the handsof the Whigs. Lord John Russell, the great promiserbut little performer, is their Premier. Just beforethe last session, he wrote his celebrated letter, amoustingto a manifesto against the people's right to norminateBishops in England assuming to bear the titles ofand to be Bishops of places in England; and nearlythe whole of the last session, which is just concluded,was spear in talk about passing a bill, rendering itillegal for any man to assume those titles in England.The question would have been totally valueless butfor the fact that we have an Established Church, withan income reckoned by millions, and that income isin the possession of another class of priests. Thestruggle really is, on the part of our aristosracy, andparticularly that portion of them that belong to theparty in power, to preserve the patronage of thisenormous revenue, and the struggle has been continuedduring the session between these two partice inrelation to the danger which the priests who are inthe saddle apprchend from those who are desireas tounhoe them, and get into it.  Having got through this session, and still continuingin power, the Whigs of course have now to castabout for a means by which they may continue longerto hold it. The people,—using that word to insladethe masses,—are not at this time repremented inParliament. One man in eighty only has a vote.Just twenty years ago, the Reform Bill, as it was called,was passed, by which the rotten-boroughs thatthen existed were cut off, but the result was, to giveonly that proportion of suffrage which I have mentioned.The rapid increase of science and knoledge,—which has since been diffused, for now twentyyears to equal to half a century in times past,—enablesthe people to see that the so called reform ismerely an instalment of their rights; and to staythemselves in office for another year, this LordJohn Russell,—who had been for the last twentyyours brusting the last bill as a final re,—cameout with a tion that another must be conceded;and it is understood that their policy, as a party, nowis, to introduce a new bill, giving something move,which the House of Lords will ruf. The Whige willthen dissolve the Parliament, and go to the country,that is, to a general tion, working the idea intothe public mind, 'If you do not keep us in, you willget no Reform Bill; therefore, return us , whowill carry that hill, in spits of the Lords, and we shallbe your faithful  in that         By this you will see they may keep is not duty fortwo years, but for many  they give a  to the pur     EDWARD .

Miss Henrietta Sergent was chosen President, protem.She opened the meeting by reading a portionof the Scriptures. protem. The following Resolutions were unanimously adopted:— 1. Resolved, That, discouraging as may at firatappear the aspect of the anti-slavery cause, we areyet convinced that the hour of its trumph assuredly,if slowly, draws nigh. Our opinion founds itselfupon the fact that the question of the continuanceor abolition of slavery is the one now most prominentlybefore the minds of the people, and beingthus entertained, we should esteem it faithlessness inthe power of Truth, were we to doubt that justicewould ultimately conquer. assuredly slowly 2. Resolved, That were it otherwise, were thecase, to all human apprehension, far more hopelessthan at present, we should recognize the duty of laboringin the slave's behalf as none the less obligatory,feeling that it is much to have washed our ownhands in innocency, and to have testified continuallyand before the world against the slave system and itsnecessary sequences and abominations. 3. Resolved, Taht language imperfectly expressesthe sentiments of sorrow and humiliation with whichwe recur to one event of the past year,—the re-on-slavementof the fugitive Sims; a deed of such fearfulatrocity, that we could hardly believe that itcould have been perpetrated within the streets of our'Pilgri city.' could 4.

He than read of a letter from Heanne Desing, of of the Voice of Women, who was now is prince onaccount of her devotice to the  of political libertyfor Women. Her offencs was meeting with an for Womens. Her offence was meeting with anassmebly of working people in illegal members,among whom she has been active in fur co-operativeunions. She is decribed by Mrs. Blackwell,of New York, as a woman of  life, whois striving to enframchise her sex. She addresses herletter from a prison in Paris. 'To the Convection ofWomen of America,' and it is also signed by anotherwoman, engaged in the same cause, Paulina Roland,who is likewise imprisoned for the same offence.The following is the translation of the letter:      Voice of Women     To the Correction of the Women of America. To the Correction of the Women of America. DEAR SISTERS: Your courageous declarion ofWoman's Rights has resounded even to our prison,and has filled  souls with incuble joy. EAR ISTERS   In France, the re-action has supported the  ofLiberty of the Women of the future. Deprived,like their brothers of the Democracy, the right ofWomen to civil and political equality, and the legallaws which trammel the libety of the press, sladerthe propagation of those eternal truths which mustregenerate humanity.  They wish also—the Women of France—to founda hospitable tribunal, which shall receive the cry ofthe oppressed and suffering, and vindicate, in thename of human solidarity, the social right for bathsexes equally; and where Woman, the Mother ofHumanity, may claim in the name of her children,mutilated by tyranny, her right to true liberty, to thecomplete development and free exercise of all herfaculties, and reveal that half of truth which is inher, and without which no social work can be complete. The darkness of the re-action has obscrued theSun of 1848, which seemed to rise to radiantly.Why? Because the revolutionary tempest, in over-turningat the same time the Throne and the Scaffold,in breaking the chain of the black slave, forgotto break the chain of the most oppresed of all—ofWoman, the Parish of humanity. 'There shall be no more slaves,' said our brethren.'We proclaim universal suffrage. All shall havethe right to elect the agents who will cary out thatConstitution which should be based on the principlesof Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. Let each onecome and deposit him vote; the barrier of privilegeis overturned before the electoral urn; there are nomore oppressed, no more masters and slaves.' Woman, in listening to this appeal, rises and apprioachesthe liberating urn to exercise her right asmember of society. (1) But the barrier of privilegerises also before her. 'You must wait,' they say!But by this claim alone Woman affirms the right,not yet recognized, of the half of humanity—theright of Wimen to Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.She obliges man to verify the fatal attack which bemakes on the integrity of his principles. (1) An soon, in fact, during the wonderful days ofJune, 1848, Liberty glides from her pedestal in theflood of the victims of the re-action;—based on theright of the stronged, she falls, overturned in thename of 'the right of the strongest' the stronged The Assembly kept silence in regard to the rightof one half of humanity—for which only one of itsmembers (2) raised his voice but in vain; no mentionwas made of the right of woman, in a Constitutionframed in the name of Liberty, Equality andFraternity. (2) It is in the name of these principles that Womancomes to claim her right to make part in the LegislativeAssembly, and to help form the laws whichmost govern society, of which she is a member. She comes to demand of the electors the comcrationof the principle of equality by the electionof a Woman, and by this act (3) she obliges man toprove the fundamental law which he has farmed inthe sold name of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity,is still based upon privilege. And soon privilegetriumphs over this phantom of universal suffrage,which, being but the half of itself, sinks on the 31stof May, 1850.  (3) privilege. But while those elected by the half of the people,by men alone, evoke force to stifle liberty, and forgerestrictive laws to establish order by compre—Woman, guided by fraternity—foressing incessantstruggles, and in hope of putting an end to them,makes an appeal to the laborer to found Liberty andEquality on fraternal solidarity. The participationof Woman gave to this work of enfranchisement aneminently pacific character, and the laborer recognizesthe right of Woman, his companion in labor.  The delegates of a hundred and four annociations,united without distinction of sex, elected two Women(4) with several of their brethren, to participateequally with them in the administration of the interestsof lanor, and in the organiztion of the work ofsolidarity. (4) Fraternal associations were formed with the objectof enfing the laborer from the yoke ofspoliage and patronage; but isolated in the midst ofthe Old World, their efforts could only produce afeeble amelicration for themselves.  The union of associations based on fraternal solidarityhad for its end the organization of labor, thatis to may, an equable division of labor, of instruments,and of the produce of labor. The means were, the union of labor and of creditamong the workers of all professions, in order to acquirethe instruments of labor, and the necessarymaterils, and to form a mutual guarantee for theeducation of their children, and to provide for theneeds of the old, the sick, and the infirm. In this organization (5) all the workers, withoutdistinction of sex or profession, having an equalright to election, and being eligible for all functions,and all having equally the intiative and the reigndecision in the note of common inter—theylaid the foundations of a  society based on Liberty,Equality and Fraternity. (5)     It is in the name of law framed by Man only—bythose elected by privilege—that the old world, wishingto stifle in the germ the holy work of pacific enfranchisement, has shut up within the walls of aprison those who had founded it, those elected bythe laborers. But the pulse has been given—a grand set hasbeen accomplished. The right of Woman has beenrecognised by the laborers and they have concratedthat right by the election of those who hadclaimed it in vain for both sexes, before the elctroalurm, and before the electoral tters. Theyhave received the true civil baptism; elected by theirborers to accomplists the mission of ,after having  their rights and their du,they share to-day their captivity.       It is from the depths of their pri that they addressto you the relation of those facts, which containin themselves high instruction. It is by labor,it is by entering recolutely into the ranks of theworking people, that Women will conquer the civiland political equality on which depends the part of the kingdom of Esuality and Justice shall be on               your are  to the  of the rightof  to civil and political equality.

He desired these classes of in the community: Manish Men—not manly butmanish; Womanish Woman, and those whoe thinkthat woman will become masuline if is admittedto the rights and privilegoes she claims. The firstcomprise those men who pride themselves upontheir exclusive privileges; upon their  andphysical suporiority, and these things which theyhave  to themselves. Thesecond are those women who  the things mostwhich will pleace the porverted  of man, andwho take pleasure in these  which the womanlywoman despises from the bottom of her heart;and the third are those whose ideal of is seen in the srail and delicate beauty, the supinessand submsive spirit of the woman of fashion.He portrayed the true ideal of a prefect that in which courage, and vigor and manly beauty,are  with the gantlemen,  anddelicacy of woman. He usly is the here who there qualities in his nature. He alluded to thehighest and most perfect type of true manliness, theSavlour of the World, in whom the moral energy,wisdom and  of a true humanity were blendedwith the utmost parity,  and love. Healso dwelt upon the charatertics of a true womanbood,and showed how much mankind need her purifyingand restraining influence in the affairs of theGovernment and the State.               The following Letter from Miss MARTINEAU wasread to the Convention:— ARTINEAU CROMER, [England,]  3,1851. ROMER  MY DEAR MADAM: I beg to think you heartily foryour kindness in sonding me the Report of the Proceedingsof your 'womanls Rights Convention.' Ihad gathered what I could from the newspapers concerningit, but I was gratified at being able to read,in a collected form, addresses so full of earnestesand sound turth as I found most of the speches tobe. I hope you are aware of the interest excited inthis country by that Convention; the strongest proofof which is the appearance of an article on the subjectin The Westminster Review, (for July,) asthrough going as any of your own addresses, andfrom the pen (at last, as it is understood here,) ofone of our very first men—Mr. John S. Mill. I amnot without hope that this article will materiallystrongthen your hands, and I am sure it cannot butcheer your hearts. Y EAR ADAM The Westminster Review AS for me, my thoughts and best wishes will bewith you when you meet in October. I cannot acceptyou hearty invitation to attend your Convention,as my home duties will not allow of my leaving myown country. But you may be assured of my warmand unrestricted sympathy. Ever since I becamecapable of thinking for myself. I have clearly seen—and I have said it till my listeners and readers areprobably tired of hearing it—that there can be butone true method in the treatment of scuh human being,of either nex, of any color, and under any outwardcircumstances—to asoertain what are the powersof that being to cultirate them to the utmost,and then to see what action they will find for themselves.This has probably never been done for men,unless in some rare individnal cases. It has certainlynever been done for women: and, till it is done,all destbating about what woman's intellect is—allspeculntion, or laying down the law, as to what iswoman's sphere, is a more beating of the sir. Apriori conceptions have long been found worthlessin physical science and nothing was really effectedtill the experimental method was clearly made outand strictly applied in practice, and the same principleholds most curtainly through the whole range ofMoral Science. Whether we regard the physicalfact of what women are able to do, or the moral factof what woman ought to do it is equally necessaryto  from making any  to experiment.We see plaloly enough the waste of timeand thought among the men who once talked of Natureabhorring a vacuum, or disputed at great longthas to whether angle could go from end to end withoutpassing through the middle; and the day willcome when it will appear to be no less absurd tohave argued, as men and women are arguing now,about what woman ought to do, before it was ancertainedwhat woman can do. Let us once see a hundredwomen educated up to the highest point thateducation at present reaches—let them be suppliedwith such knowledge as their faculties are found tocrave and let them be fre to  apply and increasetheir knowledge as their faculties shall instigate,and it will presantly appear what is the sphere ofeach of the hundred. One may be discoveringcomets, like Miss Herschel; one may be layingopen the mathematical structure of the universe,like Mrs. Somerville; another may be analyzing thechemical relations of Nature in the laboratory;another may be penstrating the mysteries of physiology;others may be applying Science in the healingof diseaues; others may be investigating the laws ofsocial relations, learning the great natural laws underwhich society, like every thing else. proceeds;others, again, may be actively carrying out the socialarragements which have been forward underthese laws; and others may be obictly odccupied infamily business, in the duties of the wife and mother,and the ruler of a household. If, among the hundredwomen, a great diversity of powers should appear,(which I have no doubt would be the case.)there will always be plenty of acope and materialfor the greatest amont and variety of power thatcan be brought out. If not—if it should appearthat women full below men in all but the domesticfunction—then it will be well that the experimenthas been tried; and the trial had better go on forever,that woman's sphere may forever determine itself,to the satisfaction of everybody. then Apriori    It is clear that Subcation to be what I demand onbehalf of woman must be intended to issue in motivelife. A man's medical education would be worthlittle, if it was not a preparation for practice. Theastronomer and the chemist would put little forceinto their studies, if it was certain that they mustleave off in  or five years, and do nothing for therest of cheir lives; and no man could possibly feelmuch interest in political and social  if heknow that he must all his life long pay taxes butneither speak nor more about public affairs. Women,like men, must be educated with a view to action,or their studies cannot be called Education,and so judgement can be formed of the  of theirfacultios. The  must be the life's business,or it will be man  of an income task. Thiswas alway my point of difference with one who carefullycherished a revereance for woman—the lateDr. Channing. How much we spoke and wrote ofthe old  Hewould have had any woman  her had  physical  orlaw,  and political  but hewould have had her stop at the studay.

 Last evening, a meeting, convened by the advocatesof the new American costume, of which Mrs.Amelia Bloomar is the reputed founder, was held inthe British Institution, Cowper street, Finsbury. Itwas announced that the proceedings would commenceat half-past 8 o'clock, and that Mrs. C.H.Dexter would address the meeting on the preparedtransatlantic reform. Long before seven o'clock,many hundreds of persons assembled in front of thebuilding; and, although the crowd was extremelydense, the mob unusually violent, and the demandsfor admission indescribably clamorous, the clockstruck sight before the doors were opened. As may be readily imagined, the assembled personspressed with great real into the building; somewere trodden down, others fainted, and the largehall, which is capable of holding from 1200 to1500 persons, rapidly filled. The prices of admissionwere fixed as follows: For the hall, 3d.; for reservedseats, 6d.; and for the platform, 1s.; but owingto the want of arrangement that prevailed, notone out of a hundred who entered the building paidany thing for admission. Of the persons present,five to one were men, who could not be supposed tohave any direct interest in the charge of which the Bloomers recommend.  The internal which elapsed between the admissionof the auditory and the time appointed for theentrance of the Bloomers was passed in a most disorderlymanner. All sorts of jokes and witticismswere bandied about, and some very coarse remarkswere made at the expense of the dress reformers.As the principal reformers were after time, it wassuggested that a grand chorus of 'Buffalo gals, can'tyou come out to-night?' would be an appropriateinvitation to expedition. Soon after this, one of thevergers of St. Paul's Cathedral, a portly-lookingman, placed himself in the presidential chair, andwas loudly but ironically cheered. A gentleman, who seemed to be an official person,jumped upon the table, at this stage of the proceedings,and delivered the following address: 'Ladiesand gentlemen—I am requested by the managersto state, that Mrs. Dexter is outside, and assoon as the police can clear the crowd that is pressingupon the doors without, she wil appear.'Another person informed the meeting that Mrs.Dexter would appear as soon as the upper ceased.She could not be expected to enter while the meetingwas conducting itself in a manner disgraceful to aBritish audience. (Great uproar.) The Verger of St. Paul's: The sooner the better,or else there will be a jolly row. (Laughter andcheers.) I don't much care, I've got a very comfortableseat here. Half-past nine o'clock arrived, and the indignationof the meeting vented itself in the most fearful yelling.Threats of damage to the building were proclaimed,and great anxiety prevailed last injurymight be inflicted. A man, habited in the Bloomer costume, cameupon the platform, and addressed the meeting asfollows: Ladies and Gentlemen—According to arrangement,my wife, Mrs. Dexter, is here in thisroom. We have been waiting in the next room forhalf an hour, and could not get out. But if you willbe quiet, Mrs. Dexter will come. (Uproar.) I wishher to come forward, if she is in the room. Whenshe was in the next room, she was obliged to changeher costume with another lady, in order to getthrough she crowd. I missed her, and I can tell nomore. (Uproar.) As there appeared no symptom of Mrs. Dexter'sarrived, loud cries again rose from every part of thehall. Several gentlemen demanded to know whowere the committee appointed to manage the matter,and Mr. Taylor having announced himself one ofthat body, he was informed that proceedings wouldbe taken against him and others, at the police office,for obtaining money under false pretence. Thisintimation was received with great favor by themeeting, who cheered it most vociferously. A loud cry was raised for the chairman, and theverger of St. Paul's, who had been occupying hismost and calmly surveying the agitated state of themeeting, rose and beat a hasty retreat. There wasanother cry for Mr. Dexter, but he had disappeared. Mr. Taylor, a committeeman, informed the meetingthat it was intended to defer the meeting untilnext Monday, when the ball would be opened free.On being asked to return the money paid for admission,he said he could not find the check-taker.(Loud expressions of indignation.) He was aboutattempting the effect his escape, when he was roughlyseized and made prisoner by the gentlemen onthe platform. The excitement at this stage of the proceedingswas of a frightful character. Through a window atthe extreme end of the hall, a dummy is roughBloomer costume was suspended. There was adesperate rush from one end of the hall to the other,and many persons were seriously injured. A young woman, who had been standing in the bodyof the hall, made her way to the platform, and succeededthe table. Under the imression that it was Man,Bloosom in ordinary female costume, the meetingcheered her with great enthusiam, and then relapsedinto a dead silence. She then addressed themeeting as follows: Ladies and gentlemen, I havegot on this platform to show you that if Mrs. Dexteris here in this room, she can come up have with thegreatest care. (Hear, hear, hear.) Gentleman willallow her to pass, and not only allow her to pass, butassist her if she will make the attempt. (Cheers.)Come forward, Mrs. Dexter, if you are here. (Renewedcheering.) Come forward, if you do notwish to make fools of the ladies and gentleman whoare present. Mrs. Dexter, I call upon you to comeforward and show yourself to these gentlemen;there is no corner of the room from which you cannotpass through these gentlemen, dense as thecrowd is. (Cheers.) If Mrs. Dexter will not comeforward, let those who are connected with her returnthe money that has been paid at the doors. If shedoes not do that, all this proceeding will be putdown as a swindle. My opinion is, ladies and gentlemen,that you are colloected here to be laughed at,or to have your pockets picked. I am told that acommittee of men undertook to  this affair;why, then, don't they do their duty? If women hadformed the committee, you would have soon thelady.—Mrs. Dexter. (Lord cheers.)  A call was refused for Mr. Taylor, the committee-man,and he stood side by side on the table with thevalorous young woman who had undertaken to leadthe meeting. He presented a most pitiable and lamentableappearance, being a person of small stature. The young woman, taking him by the hand,said: Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the responsibleparties, one of the committee. Mr. Dexterhas gone, the check-taker has gone, and thispoor young man has been leftto settle the matterwith you. [Laughter.] The young woman (addressing Taylor:) Whathave you to say said. Mr. Taylor, looking very  held hishot before his eyes, but  so explanation.   Soon conversation took place between Mr. Taylorand his Mr.  during which time the very  At length she said,This gentleman says Ms. Dexter has gone to seek hiswife  of laughter.] and yet they say Mr. Dexteris in the  What do they soon by they mean by all this?Let this  young  explain it.

The  woman: There is a man who callshimself an Englishman, and is  of his name,[Hear, heaar] I will ask him another question andthat in whether he known how the money whichhaas been collected at the doore has been dependedof?   Mr. Taylor: I don't know, the check  hasgane. [Human and yells]  The young woman addressing Taylor: you get any money  [Thomenjous cheering.]   Mr. Taylor made some reply but it was to every one but the young woman, who said Gentlemanhe says he has got money in has pocket, but itdoes not blong to him.  Upon this announcement being maaade, a rest bodyof  pushed towards the platform, to take summary vengence upon poor Taylor.He was driven right and left with  and would probably have jury, had not the police entered and  thedanger to which he was exposed,  removedhim.        Several other persons addressed the meeting inan impassioneed manner, denouncing the whole offairas an unmittigated hoax, ad unqelified The remarks which were directed personally towaardsMrs. Dector and the leaders of the party, the law of libel forbids us to publish.   As there seemed to be no chance of address by Mrs. Dexter the auditory with violent inventivvess Bloomeries and itadvocates.   There seems to be so doubt that the mans of persons who assembled complately Mrs. Dexter. It is equally certain that althoughthere were many persons present who were to treat the matter aas a joke the vast majority ofthe audience would have encured for Mrs. Dexter'sfair beering and have protected has from say moyance.The attention which the young womanwhose part in the proceeding we have is a sufficient excomplification of this fact.      

 The Sixteenth Annual Meeting of the Rhode IslandState Anti-Slavery Society will be holden atMechanics' Hall, Providence, on Wednesday andThursday, November 5th and 6th, commencing at10 o'clock, A.M., on the day first named. Friends of the slave in the State where freedomof con, in its broad import, was first proclaimed need we urge pou upon an ocassion like this, torespond to this call? Need we say to you, that theenemy you oppose is not only the friend of slaveryat the South, but of a tyranny at the North far moredegrading than any which has ever found the sanctionof law on our continent? Need we tell youthat your rights have been invaded and trampledupon in the efforts of the opressor to strengthenthe Africans chain?—that your homes are made prison-houses—that your hands are commanded to performthe work of the despot's bloodhound—that theliberty of conscience, which you have boasted fortwo centuries, is crused from the record of your rights—that the patriotism of seventy-six is become theteason of fifty-one, and that the war, thus ruthiouslycommenced and wantonly urged, is proclaimed alreadyto be one of extermination against what you,as Republicans, have held most dear. At such atime, need we make our plea in tears, or urge theclaims of Freedom in lengthened words! May wenot know, that what you have been, you will continueto be.—that what you have failed to do, throughluck of belief in the recklessness of your enemies,you will determine to perform, at whatever sacrifice?   pou know Come to our meeting—sit with us, counsel us, encourageus, help us!

The weather, during nearly thewhole time, was excredingly unfavorble, but the attendancewas quite good. Thoms S. F, ofUpton, was shorn President, and Henry Fish, orMildord, Secretary. The principal topics of discrussionwere the Legislation of the National Government onmatters pertaining to Slavery, (which was shown tobe wicked and tical,) the position and apparentlydeerd course of the Free Soil Party, the CalenisationSociety, (the hand of Slavery,) and wita few noble exceptions, the pre-slavery character ofthe American churches. These questions were discussedby Stephen  Foster, Lucy St, SamuelMay,  Laring Moody.        Upton, we trust will continue to maintain her well  as  slaverytown.

I have no despire for glory—but this glory I accept,in order t merit it. I decept it as a pledge of common () and I  it as a of the  of the  nation with allnaions.

Permit me not to speak any more of the refusal ofthe government of the French republic to grant me apassage through its territory. I know that the Frenchpeople are not responsible for and are not identifiedwith its acts. I know that neither M.L.N. Bonapartc,I know that the executive power is delegated tothem: but that the honor of the French nation is notin their keeping. I shall no longer hear in mind theirrefusel, and I desire what humanity shall not rememberit if by any  those who have been alreadyin exile and who, to all appsance, have forgottonit, should again be so.

I pressed hishand with pity with emotion and gently reproachedhim for his termerity 'Que  rous! he answered;I desired to couch your hand, I could not find aboat, I took to the water and here I am. Are thereany obstacles to him who will?' I bowed to thesenoble words. The love of liberty, the sentiment ofduty and fraternity were mine before coming to Marselles;but it is at Marsilles I have found the mossn,'There are no  to him who wills.' That shall be mine.
