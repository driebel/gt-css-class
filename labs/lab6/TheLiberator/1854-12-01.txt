 DEAR FRIEND GARRISON: EAR RIEND ARRISON On Thursday evening of last week, the 16th inst.,there was held at Blackstone, in a spacious and fineHall, an Anti-Slavery Social Party, which proved to bean interesting and pleasant gathering and one of profit—profit in more senses than one, but one in particular—to our type of freedom. The evening was quite unfavorable,it being very dark and threatening; but somewherenear three hundred persons assembled, and madeit what, under the circumstances, might be called a successfulfestival. Rev. Mr. Tappan, Free-Will Baptist,commenced the speaking exercises of the occasion withsome appropriate remarks, and Rev. T.W. Higginson,who had been invited to be present, followed him in aninteresting speech of about half an hour's length. Mr.Higginson gave a short and somewhat amusing accountof the late affair with the redoubtable kidnapper, A.O.Butman, and particularly of the part that Stephen S.Foster acted in it. Such places, however, are neverthe places for much speaking, and Mr. H. gave practicalproof that he not only believed brevity the soul ofwit, but the soul of good sense (on such an occasion)also. His presence and speech, however, added muchto the interest and pleasure of the party. one The tables were neatly and tastefully prepared, andheavily laden with a great variety of good things temptingto the appetite, which were nearly all disposed of,at a reasonable price, and to the advantage of the Anti-Slaverytreasury. I believe that about seventy-five dollarswere raised above all expenses, the most of whichwill go to the Massachusetts Society, and the remainder,perhaps, to the Worcester Co. Society. This Party originated with a very few anti-slaveryladies, who found many obstacles in their way, and whocarried it through in a spirit and manner highly creditableto their interest and zeal in the cause. Most ofthe gentlemen who generously rendered them essentialservice, did so, I presume, from their solicitation and influence,and so they will look to them for their meed ofpraise, and, of course, receive it. But it is gratifyingand encouraging to see that, amidst the general and indifference, there is, in almost every town,at least a small remnant of females, who are ever readyto do what their hands find to do, towards the deliveranceof the perishing bondman, and the advancementof the cause of freedom. They will have theirreward, for philanthropy will pay—if not in dollarsand cents, yet in 'the soul's calm sunshine and heartfeltjoy,' and in an increase of light, strength and hope.They that water hi all be watered in return. May othersconsider the example of the Blackstone ladies, and'go and do likewise.'  will W.H. FISH.

 MONTEREY, October 20, 1854. ONTEREY Messrs. Editors: The citizens of our quiet little townwere taken by surprise this morning, on hearing that awhole family had been brutally murdered by a band ofrobbers, consisting of Mexicans and Americans, sevenin number, at a house kept a colored man namedJames Anthony, or, as he was commonly known here, asAnton, at the Pass at Salinas river, twelve miles fromMonterey. It appears that these men, all well armed, called atAnton's for the ostensible purpose of buying some cigarsand something to eat, when they knocked down andnearly killed Anton, and then commenced to rob badpillage the house of every thing that was valuable, buttheir principal object was money, of which they obtainedabout $2,000. They then brutally murdered thefather, with and child of the landlord, and a Frenchman,after which they set fire to the house, and burnedit to the ground. Doring the robbing and murdering the lights wereextinguished, by which means Anton managed to escapefrom the house, and concealed himself in the bushes untilmorning, when he gave the alarm to the neighbors.

 A dreadful railroad collision occurred on the morningof the 22d ult. at Yorkville, N.Y. The down NewHaven freight train had been detained on the road byan accident in the vicinity of Eighty-Ninth street. The5 o'clock down train from White Plains came along atthe rate of thirty miles an hour, while the New Haventrain was stopping, and ran into it the locomotive 'Albany"dashing into the freight car and shivering it topieces, and injuring five other cars and their continents.The tender of the locometive was driven into the firstpassenger car behind it. This car was filled with people.Men were found lying in the car, with brokenarms and legs and otherwise injured. The car wasalmost a complete wreck. The second car was alsobadly smashed, and more or less of its passangers werewounded. The following is a list of the wounded:—George Douglas of Harlom, Levi Douglas, GeorgeBarnes, C. Ray, W. Farrington (has an arm broken),and Mr. Shackman, do; thigh broken; Mr. Brown,New Hope, legs and arms fractured; A. McFadden,Merricania; Mr. Colgrove, do; John Lemon, NewHope; C. Brooke, New York; L.D. Cummings, do.,conductor of the passanger train, leg featured; W.Elliost, engineer, severely hurt. Two of the injuredpersons are reported to have died. Their names are notmentioned. The loss of property to the railroad companyis estimated at about $15,000. 

 In the Melbourne (Australia) Argus, of June 21st, isthe following report of a case which was brought beforethe Country Court of Bourke—His Honor R.W. Pohiman,Erq.. Judge—by a colored American, named Patterson,against a white American, named Travers, forassault and battery. It is an exemplification of Britishjustice which it gives us much pleasure to record. Mr. M'Dermott said this was an action in trespassfor assault and battery. The pleas were, notguilty, and a special plea that defendant was justified,plaintiff having entered a certain room, andbeing requested to withdraw, bad refused to doso, and was thereupon put out, without any unnecessaryviolence. The defendant was an Americangentleman, who was the proprietor of a bowlingsaloon in Great Bourke streat. The game of bowlsis not an English game, but something like a gameof marbled upon a large scale, bowling down objectsin the distance. Those who appreciated thegame were to pay a certain sum for the use of theroom and the balls, which was always paid by theloser. The plaintiff was a gentleman of some respectabilityin Melbourne, and, on the 17th March,he entered the bowling saloon, where there wereMr. Moss and some other gentlemen. Mr. Mossinvited plaintiff to bowl with him, and, whilstdoing so, defendant came up and said that nodarkey should bowl there. The plaintiff replied,that he had as good a right as any one else, butdefendant insisted that he should not remain.Whilst plaintiff was proceedings out of the roomin a way to show that he would not be driven out,the defendant seized upon him and assaulted himin a violent, cowedly and savage manner, saying,I'll show you—niggers not to come into mysaloon.' If this had been a mere ordinary case ofassault, he should have left it to jury withoutfurther comment; but this case was very different,and involved the rights and privileges of aBritish subject, who was to be exposed to suchtreatment because of the color of a skin not like his own—a principle held by the glorious Republicwho enforced the liberty of the subject accordingto their own peculiar notions, and wouldcoerce an individual by the exercise of Lynh lawupon him. Such men would willingly introduceslavery into the colony, with all its abominations,cruelties, and horrors, and enforced by the riflethe bloodhound, and the lash. The laws of thiscountry knew no difference as to color, and hewould deny that the American had so very great aphysical and moral development over the negro assome demanded for him. They had established aRepublic of their own, which was fully equal tothe Republic of America itself; and in manlyfeelings and sentiments, they were unsurpassed,and they were not to be oppressed and ill-treatedbecause they had a dark skin. There was a largelass of honest citizens of that description in Melbourne,and if the plaintiff did not obtain a verdictthat day, it would admit the thin edge of oppressioninto the colony. They could be ejected from abowling saloon, or treated in any other oppressivemanner. The right band of citizenship had beenextended towards them, and they were entitled toall the rights of British subjects. His client hadbeen outraged in his person and his feelings, becausehe was said to belong to a race that was notfit to associate' with the free and enlightened citizensof America; and that doctrine it was attemptedto be held here. The outrage had beencommitted in a place of public amusement, towhich plaintiff had a full right, being willing topay his money; and no notice was given that itwas kept for the use of the Americans, or that anydifference was made as to color. It was a privilegefor the assessors to vindicate their gloriousconstitution, and to return such a verdict in thecase as they considered the plaintiff to be entitledto.  Mr. Zachariah Dunlop Patterson : I am plaintiff.On 17th March, went to a bowling alley inGreat Bourke street. On my way from tea to myplace of business, I stepped in, when a gentlemancalled me to roll. I rolled two bulls, and waswaiting for the pins to be placed so as to knowthem down again, when plaintiff came up, put hishand on my shoulder, and said no darkish shouldroll in that alley—he would not allow it. I replied,that as long as I behaved with proprietyand paid my way. I had a common right with othersto roll. Defendant put down his slate, onwhich he was keeping the game, to put me out.He told me to go out. I told him I would not beput out, but would go out, if he would give metime. He then caught hold of the collar of mycoat. We tossed around the alley, he attemptingto put me out, for someminutes; finally. I gotaway, or he let go. I stood leaning against anoyster room, in connection with the alley, readinga bill, when he rushed towards me, saving, 'Younigger! aint you going out!' I replied, that Ihad always treated defendant as a gentleman, anddid not merit such treatment. He then seized meby the throat, and pushed me against the side ofthe door, and choked me down to the floor, he beinga powerful one, and I a delicate one. Heraised his hand to strike me. when some one said,'Do not strike him.' Heard several persons. whomI supposed to be Americans, say round the alley,'Put the nigger out.' In a short time, I wentout. I was injured, and attended by Dr. Iffia.The defendant left Canada at the time of the rebellion.I was injured in my neck and back, andcould not follow my business the next day. I wasobliged to engage a man. The rules of the bowlingalley are, that loser shall pay at the endof the game. No objection was made to entering. I askedthe marker if the alley was disengaged, and hesaid,'Yes.' I then began the game. Would notswear defendant to be the owner. Was told by defendantthat he had purchased the alley. The firstobjection was by the defendant as to darkish notbeing allowed. I was prepared to pay. Cross-examined by Mr. Ireland: I swear I rolledtwo balls. I have seen English, Irish and Scotchthere. I have played with Englishmen at the backof the Criterion. I could not go into a bowlingalley in America, on account of my complexion.The defendant said that he wished to establish theprecedent that no colored man should play. I didnot know it until he told me in the alley that evening.He put his hand on my shoulder. If hewhispered, it was a very loud whisper. He saidno darkish should bowl in that alley. I ratherthink other people could have heard it. I said Iwould go, if he gave me time. I said that becauseI did not wish to be driven out. Do not knowthat the rest of the company spoke to Mr. Travers,and objected to me, before he attempted to put meout. He pulled me about the alley, and hokedme. Re-examined by Mr. Wood: If I  into achurch in America, I should be put into the negropew, or some kind of pen. I have been in thisbowling alley before, but never played, neitherwas I objected to.  * * * * * Mr. Ireland, for defendant, regretted that somuch wanton and virulent abuse had been importedinto the case against Americans and Americaninstitution, and the American had as much rightto protection as the colored man. He (Mr. Ireland)was opposed to every description of slavery, blackor white, as much as his learned friend who hadmade so much noise upon the subject that day, whoshould not have forgotten that slavery was bequeathedto America by Britons, and it had nowbecome an integral portion of their institutions,that it could not be separated from them. From1752, when the famous principle was enunciated byLord Mansfield, that a slave could not breathe inEngland, until 1832. the negroes in the West Indieswere not emancipated, and then only by thepayment of $20,000,000 derived from the sweat ofthe brows of Her Majesty's subjects. But thiscould not be done in America without dissolvingthe Union. He hoped the time would come whenthe colored men would be more worthy of civil andreligious liberty than they were at present. Theywere but little entitled to the sympathy of thosewho wished to emancipate them, and consideredthat slavery ought to be abolished. The facts ofthe case were. that bowling was a national game,and defendant had taken these premises for thepurpose, at a heavy rent. and his customers werepeculiarly prejudiced against colored men, andknowing that, such men ought not to have intrudedamong them. It was no greater a hardshipthat at home,—a man must wear a dress coat inthe hoaxes of the opera, or that railroad directorsdid not allow servant in livery to ride in first-classcarriages. It was well known that the black manindicated no social position at all, and even whenemancipated, they must turn their energies to betterpurposes that they did at present to remove theopinions of the Americans against them But itwas not because that such a prejudice existedagainst them that Mr. Patterson was to be made avictim and a martyr, and to raise a question as toraces: and he had no business to enter his blackface into the saloon, more especially being the onlyone there. The read question, however, for theirconsideration was. whether Travers had used moreviolence than was necessary to remove this man,and upon that point the case of Wood v. Leadbitterwas conclusive. On the present occasion hethought it right to put forward the claims of America,who might one day become our most powerfulally.The colored men obtained all that theywere entired to, and it would be more good tasteif they were more retiring than they were. Butthis colony was not to be the battle-ground betweenblack and white, and he was sure the assessorswould not make it an arena for any such purpose.He (Mr. Ireland) considered the black lower in thescale than the white, and he preferred white companyto black; but that was not the question, butwhether these men could intrude where they pleasedwithout being turned out. In this case, Traversdid not act of his own motion, but according to therequests of those who were his customers to removean obnoxious individual, to whom Americans bothof the South and other States would object; and itwould be for them to say whether any unreasonableviolence had been used; if not, his client wasentailed to their verdict. He would now call witnesseswho would clearly establish his view of thecase. Mr. Thomas Harvey Travers: I keep a bowlinsalcon.It is a national game. I have been openabout five weeks. I pay $130 a week rent. Ihave been well patronized by Americans. I didnot see the plaintiff come in. I saw him with aball in his hand, and went and whispered low inhis ear, 'You can't roll here.' I whispered so asnot to hurt his feelings. He replied, 'What doyou mean?' I told him the Americans would notcome if I allowed colored men to roll. I said nothingto him at first about darkish. He became a littleboisterous. I told him I wanted no noise in theally, and he must go out. He said he would goout when he was ready. I told him he must goout at once. I put my hand on his shoulder, andtold him to go. He said he would not be put out.I pushed him gently towards the door: he grabbedme by the breast, and resisted. He possessesa little strength, although small. I went and satdown. and went on marking the game. He begantalking and making a noise: and then I went upagain, and told him he must go out right away ; Iwould not wait another minute. He said he wouldnot be put out. I seized him probably by thethroat. In the scuffle we both fell down. He said,'Don't strike me.' I said I did not intend. Hethen said if I let him go, he would go out. I didso, and he went out. I did not use any more violencethan was necessary to remove him. Cros-examined by Mr. M'Dermott: It is againstmy rules to allow a colored man to roll. I tellthem that. I whispered that to plaintiff. Myobjection is. because it would injure my business.I have no written rules : they are in myhead. It is on the ground of self-interest thatI object to colored men in my salon. The Americanswould not support me if I did so. I am nota native of South Carolina, nor have I been there.I was not a policeman in America. I decline answeringwhether I have possessed black men aschattel property. I decline to answer whether Ihave ever branded black men with red-hot irons.I do not believe I put my knee on plaintiff when hefell. I only used sufficient violence to overcomehis violence. [For lack of space, we emit the testimony of the witnesses,pro and con.] Edward R. M'Culloch : The bowling alley is national,and called American. It is supported bythem, and could not be supported without. Mr. M'Dermott : It is not because Americangentlemen wish to amuse themselves, that Britishinstitutions should be trampled on. * * * * * In reply, Mr. M'Dermott said that the argumentused by the other side was, that American prejudiceswere to succumb to British rights. It wasstrange to hear a British counsel in a British courtof justice get up and uphold slavery. Mr. Ireland must object to this, as he had particularlyguarded himself against saying so. Mr. M'Dermott, in continuation, said that he hadlegitimately introduced the subject of slavery—asystem abhorred—and his learned friend attemptedto palliate that system. Lord Brougham had remarked :'Toll me not of rights.—talk not of theproperty of the planter in his slaves. I deny theright, I acknow ledge not the property, The principles,the feelings of our common nature rise inrebellion against it. Be the appeal made to theunderstanding or to the heart, the  is thesame which rejects it. In vain you tell me of lawswhich sanction such a claim. There is a lawabove all the  of human codes, the samethroughout the world, the dawning of the creation, be,(Applause.) Was the plaintiff to be driven out ofthe bowling-alley as though he would contaminatethose assembled? It had been said that the coloredman was physically and morally inferior tothe American. This he denied. They had a highand intellectual development as much as the Americans;there was no blot on the flag of the Republicof Liberia, which could be found upon theAmerican flag; there were to be found in the cotton-fieldsand rice-swamps of South Carolina, amore noble and a more exalted race than thehave the honor of vindicating the rights ofthese men, and by their verdict prove to the worldthat the prejudices of Americas could not overthrowthe rights of British subjects and institutions. Hewould ask them to look at the evidence, and saywhich was the most intelligent, the negro or thedoctor, (the defendant,) and whether plaintiff wasnot worthy of being a citizen in any state in theworld. He was the champion of an oppressed race,a British subject, and native of Canada, and entitledto his rights and standing in the streets ofMelbourne; apart from the accident of his position,he was as respectable as the President of America.(Applause.) He trusted that justice would be alwaysdone to those who had fide from the lash ofthe oppressor and sought refuge in a British port.(Loud applause.)   His Honor, in putting the case to the assessors,ruled that he considered the bowling-alley in whichthe assault had been committed a private place,and they would so regard it. It was a principle oflaw, that every man's house was his castle, and ifit were intruded on, and the party refused on beingrequired, he could be removed, but no more forcemust be used than is absolutely necessary forthat purpose. The point in this case arose, and hewas sorry it did arise, having reference to a largeclass of persons, whose public wrongs they wouldwillingly redress. It could not be held that a coloredman could not be removed from a public place; butany one could be removed from a private place, if intruding,or even from a public place, if drunk ornoisy, but not on account of color. They hadheard the evidence of the plaintiff, that when hisfeelings had been outraged and he was about leavingthe place, Dr. Travers turned on him, a scuffleensued, and he was turned out. Was that justifiedor was greater violence used than was justifiable,under the circumstances? If not, they wouldsay what damages the plaintiff was entitled to, forthe wrong. That there should be no sympathywith the colored race, was used by Mr. Ireland indefence of his client. That this was a question, infact, between black and white, and he thoughthimself justified in doing so, because as he urged,of their moral and physical degradation. But, underthe good providence of God, they lived in timeswhen such prejudices were becoming subdued andovercome. (Applause.) The assessors having consulted for a short time,put a question to His Honor, which, not reachingthe bar, Mr. Ireland was particularly anxious toknow to what it related. His Honor said, they were only inquiring whetherthey could not go higher than £50 in returningtheir verdict. Verdict for plaintiff, £50, and costs, the announcementsof which was followed by a thunderinground of applause. For plaintiff, Mr. M'Dermott and Mr. Wood:Mr. Ireland and Mr. Dawson for defendant.

 The peculiar policy of the Know-Nothing cannotbe carried out, except through the action of theFederal Government. Naturalization law a cannotbe repealed or modified but by Congress. Foreignborncitizens cannot be left out of the numerousoffice under the Federal Government, but throughthe exercise of the patronage-power of the President.All that the Know-Nothings have done inthe States is merely preliminary. They claim tobe a National party, and their chief concern iswith National objects. Acting in their severalStates, in State affairs, and under the oath of secrecy,it is easy enough to manage in reference tothe Slavery Question. All they have to do is tohave a prudent reference to public opinion; andthe absence of any 'platform' on the subject ofSlavery facilitates this accommodating policy. Inone section, their action is pro-slavery; in another,anti-slavery; in another, simply anti-administration,or non-committal. Let us recapitulate: Mr. Benton, the only Republican from Missouri,who cherishes the anti-slavery doctrines of Mr.Jefferson, and had the courage to speak and voteagainst the repeal of the Missouri Compromise,ascribes his defeat to the Know Nothings: and theAmerican Organ, just established in Washington,as the National organ of the new Party, says: American Organ 'The final political demolition of Thomas H. Benton,(credited by himself to the votes of the Know Nothings,)was a triumph, of which our Missouri friends maybe justly proud, and upon which we congratulate theAmerican Party throughout the land'! Do the twenty thousand Free Soilers who votedwith the Know Nothing in Massachusetts respondto this? Mr. Mott, the pro-Nebraska candidate of the pro-slaveryadministration party in Pennsylvania, forCanal Commissioner, is elected by an unprecedentedmajority. Do the Free Soil Know Nothing feelproud of this result? In New York, they put up a Silver Gray FillmoreWhig, with the express view off defeatingClark and Seward. We have the testimony of theNew York Express, that the nomination would nothave been made, had Clark and Raymond remainedon the Whig Syracuse platform. which, we allknow, was non-committal as to any practical action.The probability is, that the movement has resultedin the defeat of Clark,* and in the electionof a Liquor and Nebraska candidate. What saidthe New York Know Nothing Standard, while theindications were that Seward was prostrated? InNew York, said that journal, the work of the nowparty was, 'to rebuke the higher law woollies,and all other issue, not compatible with the justrights of the People, and therefore, especially,Sewardism, and it was nobly done.' Mark! Sawardism,not as a representative of Whiggery, orMonopoly, or the Commercial Interest, but, as therepresentative of the 'higher law,' and Anti-Slaverysentiment, is to be put down. This is themission of Know Nothingism in New York, accordingto the Standard. Are our Free Soil friends preparedto sustain it in such a 'mission'? Express * Standard Standard. Hear, too, how the Richmond (Va.) Examiner,a paper which advocates slavery and the slavetrade on principle, as necessary to high civilization,approves of the Know Nothing policy in NewYork:— Examiner 'Now, as to the results. First of all, let us congratulatethe country upon the  of SEWARD.—  EWARD.  stripped him of  his  one half of his body, and  the archagitator.To the surprise of everybody, that extraordinary,invisible incomprehensible body, the Know Nothings,finished the work which Pierce began.      archagitator. They throttled Seward with the most extraordinarycase and grass, end left him, dead, mangled, lying highand dry above the lowest possible  of ill-luck, uponthe political potter's-field of New York. The Tribuneand its compatriots are now howling a wild and horribledirge over the remains of their martyr. We do notfancy the Know Nothings, but all honor to them forhaving crushed to the earth, and trampled under theirfeet, the boldest and most unprincipled fanatic that everendangered the peace of a great republic.'  Tribune Strange times these, when Fillmore Whigs. DickinsonDemocrats, Slavery Propagandists and FreeSoilers, can unite in a common Hallelujah! From the acts of the Party, let us turn to thedeclarations of their 'organs.' The New YorkKnow Nothing Standard says: 'Under these circumstances, but one course is left.'The American organization is not a institution—itextends East, West, North and South—and an entirerepudiation of every thing, like abolitionism was necessaryto preserve its integrity and unity. This independentnomination, therefore, is a guarantee to ourSouthern friends, that, whatever the parties of theNorth may do, the patriotism of the masses knows nodistinction between North and South. Whether Mr.Ullmann and his associates on the American ticket areto be elected or not, we feel convinced that the men ofreal principle attached to the American organization inthis State will vote for them, and thus exhibit theircomplete alienation from all party corruptions.' entirerepudiation of every thing, like abolitionism This independentnomination, therefore, is a guarantee to ourSouthern friends The Nashville (Tenn.) Whig copies this, with thefollowing prefatory remarks, showing the favor thenew order is beginning to find among slaveholders,fearful as they are of all secret movements:— Whig 'The leading sentiment understood to be professedby the 'Know Nothing' or 'American' party, and corroboratedby many of the results of their organization,must, in its legitimate operation, lead them to opposeevery sectionalism at war with the peace and prosperityof the Federal Union; a peculiar devotion to theperpetuity and true glory of the Union being the apparentlyrecognized basis of their existence as a party.It may be that, in some localities, incidental or othercauses have combined to place them for a time in a positionof seeming cooperation with men unsound as nationalpoliticians. But the general correctness of theirassumel national conservatism as a party, is sustainedby the labored assaults upon Know Nothingism in theNew York Tribune and the Washington National Era,especially devoted to the propagation of abolitionism andits kindred heresies, and we find another proof of theessential hostility of the Know Nothings in New Yorktowards the abolitionists, in the following explicit declarationsof the Know Nothing Standard of that city.' Federal Union Tribune National Era Standard The New Orleans (La.) Creole reprints the sameextract, finding in it a sweet odor of Nationality.It remarks:— Creole 'Nothing more satisfactory than this could be presentedto those who love the Union and defend the Constitution.In the present disorganization of the politicalelements, it is impossible to say what may be the resultof the important election which took place yesterday;but of one thing we may rest assured, that whatevermay be the result, the American party is national inits organization, its principles, and its action.' The American Organ, the National paper of theparty, is no less explicit. After committing itselfin its prospectus 'against the agitation of thequestion of slavery in Congress or out of it,' itproclaims in the first editorial of its first number,opposition to 'all "higher law" doctrines bywhich the Constitution is to be set at naught, violated,or disregarded'—thus giving currency to thealong misrepresentation of anti-slavery men sofashionable among pro-slavery politicians. Referringin another number to the project of a Constitutionalparty, started by the obsolete George M.Dallas, it inquires— American Organ 'Is it possible these politicians have not yet discoveredthat the people have themselves already formed,and raised into eminence, a new conservative party? formed,and raised into eminence, a new conservative party Have not these politicians heard from the Northwest,from the North, and from the East? Do they notknow that in New York the 'American party' is composedof sound conservative elements, entirely? Dothey not know that the 'Hards' and the 'Silver Grays'compose tbe American party in that State? Do theynot know that in Massachusetts, the Whigs, the Democrats,the Free Soilers, each ran a candidate for Governor,and that the 'American party' took up an independentconservative Union man for Governor, andelected him by a vote far exceeding all the votes castfor the three other parties? Do they not know, that theAmerican party in the' Old Bay State' is a purely nationalparty?' Whigs Democrats Free Soilers independentconservative Union man national Have Wilson, Burlingame, Knapp, DeWitt,Banks, &, become 'nationalized,' according tothe ideas of this organ of their party? Again: 'Our friends.' says this organ, 'havenever yet refused to vote for a Democratic "Hard',or a "Silver Gray" Whig, whenever such a candidatehas adopted our principles. The election ofMott in Pennsylvania, and Hincks in Baltimore, areonly two out of many instances in which Democratshave been sustained and elected by the votesof our friends.' Hard Is it true, then, that our Free Soil friends, whoare swallowed up in Know Nothingism will votefor Fillmore or Clayton, for the Presidency, providedthey be sound Native Americans? Our Union-saving 'organ' grows enthusiastic asit proceeds. The efforts of Webster. Fillmore, andthe Compromisers or 1850, to save the Union,are rivalled by what the Know Nothings have accomplishedin this line:— 'William H. Seward and his allies,' it says, 'arenew. we trust, impotent for mischief. The "Americanparty" has, in this single year, by its conservative done more for the  of the Union,than has heen done in the last twenty years, tuning andexcepting the patrictic efforts of the Union party in1850. whose labors have been renderednaught by theblundering  of this Administration.

According to this, our Free Soil friends havebeen entrapped into an Organization. whose greatmission is, to exterminate  and to revive the Compromises of  and their authors. Was it for this that Mr. performed his tour to the South, a year ago!      Again the American  brings authoritiesto  its pro-slavery position:— American    'The New York  of the  ,over the signature of "," and  the following truthful and  published in the  of Saturday to wit:              ' "The Know  and will"not  the  Theywould  they known their  in the  and  they the interior of the State, and are confident of being ablyto control both State and city elections hereafter.

'"The Anti-Slavery movement in this State has beenchecked. though it does not demonstrate any partialityfor the Nebraska bill. In fact, that question was overshadowedby the more pressing issues between the variousparties to the liquor question—i. e., 'had liquor,good liquor, and no liquor.' Both the Temperancequestion and Know Nothingism exerted more influenceupon the result than did the Nebraska question." i. e. 'It is true, strictly true, as stated by the BaltimoreSun's intelligent correspondent, that "the Know Nothingsave a NATIONAL PARTY, and will not enter into theSeward crusade against slavery." strictly true Sun's the Know Nothingsave a and will not enter into theSeward crusade against slavery.

Hards aSilver Grays, Fillmore, Clayton, Pollock, Willson,and Burlingame, undertakes to plan its Nationaloperations, and select its National candidates,what will be done? Shall the candidates be anti-slaveryor pro-slavery—for the Fugitive Act oragainst it—for the division of California or againstit—for Cuha with slavery or against it—for theexistence of slavery within Federal jurisdiction oragainst it? All these questions are of vital importance—the people have made up their minds onthem, pro or con—no man could be selected as aPresidential candidate, whose opinions are notdecided respecting them. Would the VirginiaKnow Nothings or the Massachusetts Know Nothingsbe willing to take a candidate on trust. withoutunderstanding his position? Would the formerconsent to vote for Pollock, or the latter forClayton or Fillmore?  pro con Let us say to our anti-slavery friends. who haveeither joined the Know Nothings or voted for theircandidacies—this new or ganization is beginning to belooked to by the South, especially by Southern Whigs,as the only basis of what they call a 'National party'—that is, a party which, ignoring the questionof slavery, will permit its policy on that questionto be silently determined by Southern management.Thed Semi-Weekly Creole, of New Orleans, speaksconfidently on this point. Referring to the prostrationof the old parties, and the indications ofan approaching sectional conflict, it looks to theKnow Nothings to prevent this evil. It says :— this new or ganization is beginning to belooked to by the South, especially by Southern Whigs,as the only basis of what they call a 'National party Semi-Weekly Creole 'It scems to be universally acknowledged that the"Know Nothings" aim to preserve our institutions asdelivered to them by the sainted heroce of '76.

Courier. will present acandidate for the Presidency, not only national in hisposition, but American in his heart. The people willrecognize the statesman and the patriol, and elevate himwith greater magnanimity than has been witnessed sincethe days of Washington. In another number, it reiterates these views: 'We feel confident that the South has no tangiblepoint of political union with any other party of theNorth, except the Know Nothings; that they occupy theonly national ground. The Silver Gray Whigs havebeen overslaughed by the adherents of Seward. TheNebraska Democrats claim this bill as a triumph overthe South—a victory achieved for freedom. The FreeSoilers are open in their opposition to our constitutionalrights, and the Democratic Hards are accused by theFree Soilers of having selected the same platform whichthey have adopted. With whom can the South act inthe coming national elections? Certainly, only withthose who are pledged to support the Constitution andthe laws, to maintain the Union, knowing no South, noNorth, no Edual, no West.

'With the facts we have adduced, it is a mockery ofthe good sense of the people to ask us to affiliate witheither the Whigs or the Democrats of the North. Thereis neither patriotism nor prudence, honesty nor a devotionto the rights of the South, in seeking such alliances.' Concurrently with these declarations, we findJOHN M. CLAYTON, the auxiliary of Senator Douglasin pushing through the Nebraska Bill, althoughhe declined to vote for it finally, because it did notcome up to the standard of non-intervention—placinghimself, in a public speech, delivered beforethe late election in Delaware, on Native Americanground, advocating the Know Nothings, and predictingthe impossibility of any national unionhereafter on Whig or Democratic ground. —Speaking of the distinguished men belonging tothe order, he remarked :— OHN LAYTON 'I know not upon what authority it is stated. thatthe late President of the United States is a member ofthe Know Nothing order. But I do know, that a greatnumber of the most intelligent and patrictic men ofthis country have adopted the principles and joined thesociety of this secret party.' stated. thatthe late President of the United States is a member ofthe Know Nothing order. In relation to the main principles of the Americanparty, as he calls it, he says :— 'I will not support for office a man who claims to bea Native American, unless he plants himself upon thatplatform. If he seeks my vote, he must do it by professingmy principles. He must not tell me that comeother party besides the American party here has namisatedhim for the office. He must come out plainly,and say that he asks support on the principles of theAmericans.

In other States,the division among the Whigs is such, that it is quiteimpossible that another Whig National Convention canever assemble again. And if another Democratic Conventionshould again make that effort, as it probablywill, there can be no real, heartfelt concord in such aboly. A party strong enough to sustain the Governmentin the trials to which it will inevitably soon besubjected, ought to be a desideratum with every rightmindedAmerican statesman. 'An appeal to American national feeling for such apurpose ought not to be vain; and I do not believeit will be in vain.

Shall theRepublican movement be abandoned? Shall theissue between native and foreign-born citizens besuffered to supersede the issue between Slaveryand Freedom? Shall the Anti-Nebraska movementstop midway in its course, satisfied with hivingreturned a small Anti-Nebraska majority to thenext House of Representatives, careless as towhether the next President shall be anti-slavery orpre-slavery? Will those anti-slavery men whohave united with the Know Nothing party, or votedfor its candidates, continues their support to it, inthe phase of 'nationality,' so-called, it is now assumingunder the influence of John M.

Honest men should beware of beingplaced in a position, entangled by obligations, calculatedto give rise to conflicting duties, to obscuretheir perception of right and wrong, to temptthem to compromise or postpone the application ofvital principles.

 The War in Europe.—By the arrival of the'Baltic' at New York, 26th, later intelligence hasbeen received from the seat of war. Ont he 4th of November,there was a sanguinary engagement, and onthe 5th, a terrible battle, including a sortie and generalattack by Menschikoff's whole army. The battle lastedfrom daybreak until 4, P.M. Both sides claim thevictory. The English took several hundred prisoners.The Russians stormed several batteries and silenced thegunds. The loss of the Allies was 5000; that of theRussians, 8000. Gen. Canrobert had assured theFrench government that the Russians were so weakenedin the affair, that for tend day to come, they would notbe in position to resist an assault on the town, andthat he now means to make the attempt, a practicablebreach having been effected. On the contrary, Menschikoffwrites to Pakieswitch—'It will be impossiblefor the Allies to continue the siege, and I will continueto harass them.' The War in Europe. The disastrous result to the British of the battle ofthe 26th is confirmed, although it is not quite so bad asat first represented. The great carnage was owing tothe misconstruction of an order from the CommanderinChief, that Lords Cardigan and Lucian rode the lighthorse over a plain a mile and half in length, exposedto a cross fire, full at a Russian battery of thirty guns.The attempt was madness, and the result destructive.Out of 607, only 198 returned, and these must alsohave been destroyed, but for a magnificent charge totheir rescue by the heavy dragons, and the bravestand of the Highlanders, by which the day was redeemed. Collision of Steamers in Boston Harbor.—The Ocean steamer for Bath, and the British steamerCanada came in collision near Spectacle Island, in Bostonharbor, on Friday evening last. The bow of theCanada penetrated to the express room of the Ocean,and knocked over a stove which was full of fire. Thecoals were spattered about, kindling flames which almostinstantly spread through the boat, and she was burnt tothe water's edge. Boats from the Canada, Forest City,Boston, ship Westward Ho, and others, immediately putoff to the rescue, and, so far as known, all the passengers,(upwards of 80,)except three who were drowned,were saved. Those lost were a man about thirty, a womanabout thirty-five, and a child six. They jumpedoverboard at the time of the collision. Mr. Hiram L.Wing, Messenger of Carpenter &Co's Express, who wasso badly burned, died on Saturday afternoon, at theMassachusetts General Hospital. The Ocean was aside-wheel steamer with wide guards, and in every respecta well-appointed and substantial see going steamer.Sher was of 600 or 700 tons burden, about four yearsold, and owned by Rufe K.

The Canadahad her figure head and bowsprit carried away, and heroutwater and bow somewhat injured. The crew of theOcean stated that she had comphone ahead, and thatthe cause of the instantaneous conflagration was thebursting of a large can. Nothing else, save gunpowderitself, could have produced so direct a flame. It is literallyimpossible that the more everturning of a stovecould set a vessel on fire in double the time of this, withoutthe aid of some extraordinary combustible.

We understand that the Ocean was making her lasttrip of the season, and it is stated that a portion of hercrew taken on board the Canada were in a state of intoxication.They had been an board the Canada but afew moments before they commenced a fight amongthemselves int eh fore saloon.

Mr. Charles Pops, a colored passenger, who residesat Caps Cod, and fellows the fisting business, had histhigh and ribs broken, and it was thought he would notlive through the night. His wife was also severely injured.Mrs. Barry, stewardess of the Ocean, wasdelirious, but was not materially injured. The light of the fire was seen in this city, and wasvery brilliant for an hour. Many persons went to thewharves and other localities where the fame visible.An alarm was given, and the whole fire departmentwent over to South Boston, before the cause of thelight was ascertained.

Kidnapping of Free Negroes in Kentucky— a FreeGiril taken from Ohio and Sold into Slavery— Desperationof the Gang— Negro Traders Implicated. The last few days unfolded to the public suchthrilling facts as to create a spirit of indomitabledetermination to purge this community of a classof desperadoes now infesting this section— as toinspire such enthusiastic excitement, seldom, ifever, witnessed in any city. Kidnapping free negroesin Ohio, and deluding our slaves from theirmasters, to recapture and sell them, is an establishedprofession of a gang located upon the borders of theOhio, combining with negro traderrs in the interiorof this State, thereby holdlyt conducting a villainoussystem of piracy, heretofore unknown in the annalsof crime in Kentucky. Kidnapping free negroesin Ohio is an establishedprofession of a gang located upon the borders of theOhio On Friday morning this community was apprisedof the fact, through the agency of colored persons,that a free negro girl was forcibly taken from Ohio,and brought to Kentucky. Suspicion or the statementsof the negroes (which is not evidence inKentucky) proved that Lewis, Allen and HenryYoung, of this county, were the individuals inwhose possession the girl was found. free negro girl was forcibly taken from Ohio,and brought to Kentucky. Arrests were made, our best and prominent citizensturning out to capture the rogues. Lewis andAllen Young were forcibly taken by the people,from prison, and delivered to the authorities ofOhio, where they will be disposed of as the aggravatingmerits of this case deserve. Henry Youngis detained for trial at this side. Thus this sufferingcommunity is to be rid of three brothers,whose bold career of crime was a terror to the peaceand safety of the public. Lewis ans Henry Young openly boast of theirdetermination to burn the city. They confess it tobe their source of livelihood to steal a free negro ordecoy our slaves, and sell them to negro traders.Let me here apprise the slave owners of Kentuckythat negro traders are more to be feared and require acloser watch than the incendiary abolitionists secretlyinsinuating themselves among us. that negro traders are more to be feared and require acloser watch than the incendiary abolitionists It is justly estimated that two-thirds of the slavesthat escape from their masters are transported, throughthe agency of slave dealers, to the South. Let theloser of slave property examine the negro pens ofthe State, and throughout the South, before offeringrewards or looking towards Canada.

 The autumnal meetings of the Union were heldin the three neighboring towns of Newcastle,Shields, and Sunderland. The following resolutionwas offered:— 'That this Assembly tenders to Rev. GeorgeCuthbert Young, B.A., the expression of its thanksfor the valuable and interesting paper he has nowread on "The Openings for the Gospel in Turkey,"and requests that he will place it at the disposal ofthe Committee. That a recommendation of theclaims of the "Turkish Mission," by a vote of thelast annual assembly of the Union, having givenrise to an apprehension on the part of some persons,to the effect that the Congregational Union ofEngland and Wales look with a degree of toleranceand favor on the slavery of the United States ofAmerica, in consequence of the supposed implicationof many of the Christian organizations of thatcountry in the evil of slavery, this assembly deemsit right to repeat its emphatic condemnation of thelaw and practice of slavery as existing in the UnitedStates, and to declare its undeviating adherenceto the sentiments of the Union, as expressed in itsresolutions on the subject of slavery, adopted bythe Annual Assembly of 1853, and its determinationto carry out as far as possible the resolves itcontains.' Moved by Rev. S.D. Cullen, of Laith, and seconded by Dr. Stowell, upon which Rev. WalterScott, President of Airedale College, said that 'no one could rejoice more than he didat the efforts now being made to  Turkey:at the same time, he could not suffer this motionto pass without entering a against it. They had not been told that the AmericanBoard of Missions was connected in variousways with slavery: that they had slave-churches,and that they held doctrines of the principles ofhension, were quite subversive of the principles ofthe New Testament. They maintained, in someplaces, that because it was not  said inScripture, that children must not be taken fromtheir parents, therefore there was no sin in tearingthe children of slaves from them, and sending themto distant localities. In thie belief, America wasthe stronghold of slavery: and if it could be abolishedthere, it would soon be abolished throughoutthe world; and yet he was sorry to think, thatprofessed Christians in America were the chiefstrength of that stronghold. (Hear, hear.) Hehad no doubt, whatever, that if all the Christiansin America would come forward, and perform theirduty in protesting against slavery, it would soonbe abolished there, and throughout the world. Beforethey made up their minds on this subject, headvised them to read the papers which had beenpublished by Mr. Vincent, the agent of the AmericanTract and Book Society. (Hear, hear.) Nowno one could rejoice more heartily than he did in theprogress which was made in evangelising Turkey,and he prayed that the American missionariesmight be more and more successful; but this wasa very different thing from their connecting themselvesin any way with the American Board ofMissions.'(Hear, hear.)     After amicable discussion, the resolution waswithdrawn, by concert of mover and seconder, inorder that there might not be the remotest appearanceof the evil of tolerating any degree of pro-slaveryprinciple or action.

 The New York Tribune, in a very caustic review ofthe new pro-slavery work of Rev. Nehemiah Adams,of Boston, entitled 'A South-Side View of Slavery,'says— Tribune The author of this extraordinary tractate has recentlymade himself famous by his correspondencewith the fire-eating Virginian the notorious HenryA. Wise. That correspondence placed him in noenviable position on the subject of Slavery. Itauthorized no one to form a high idea of his sagacity,breadth of view, knowledge of the world, oreven common sense. The simplicity which couldlead him to expect any valuable suggestions fromthe Hon. Mr. Wise, in regard to the domestic institutionsof the South, reminds one of his celebratednamesake and official bother. Parson Adams,in Fielding's novel of Joseph Andrews. Nor doesthis volume inspire any different opinions respectingthe caliber of the author's mind. We knownothing of him, except from the present remarkableperformance. It is understood that he is anorthodox divine of considerable repute in the metropolisof New England. If this is the case, hiswork is entitled to a degree of consideration whichit could not command by its merits. Speaking fromthe central point which he occupies, his voice willbe heard over a wider extent than could be expectedfrom its natural strength. We dare say thathe is an accomplished scholar, a preacher of enchanting,silvery eloquence, and a man of sweetamiableness and saintly sympathies. He is, doubtless,a favorite with many pious flatteries circles,admired for his unction, and beloved for his blandbenevolence. But all these charming traits do notqualify him to discuss wisely a question of gravemoral and political import. The whole tone of thevolume betrays a feeling, on the part of the author,that he was out of his element while preparing itfor the press. It has a feeble, indecisive, supplicatoryair, as if the writer wished to obtain pardonfor the expression of his opinions. While itcringes with an almost canine submission to theSouth, it does not manfully face the opponents ofslavery at the North. It rather suggests, exhorts,beseeches, than argues and enforces a principle.Indeed, there are occasional passages which wouldlead the reader, if in a mood of concession, to supposethat the author himself was adverse to slavery.He has hints to that effect. He uses languagewhich, in its literal acceptation, mplies that humanbondage is an evil: but this is not his prevailingdoctrine; the cloven foot soon becomes visible,scorching every generous impulse beneath itstread; and his choicest morsels of eloquence go toillustrate the chivalrous virtues of the slaveholder,and the enviable condition of the slave. We arenot to suppose that his apparent admissions againstslavery are for the sake of deception—intended tothrow dust in the eyes of northern readers. Theyonly show the obscurity of his perceptions, and hisvacillation of moral purpose. He undertook histask with the view of exhibiting the sunny side ofslavery; but he often relents in its execution; factsare too stubborn for his fancies; and, with an inconsistencythat does more honor to his heart thanhis head, is compelled to dash the brilliant colorsof his picture with some gloomy shades. a mplies The origin of a defence of slavery by a Northerndivine, apparently so uncalled for, becomes apparentin the progress of the work. It was promptedby a spirit of grateful sentimentalism, on account,of hospitable courtesies,during a temporary visitat the South,—by sympathy with the religious exaltationof the slave, in spite of his temporal degradation,—and by a reaction of mind from previousexaggerated views concerning the obvious, visibleeffects of the servile relation.

 Mr. John Speer, writing from this territory,Oct. 11, says: 'Will slavery be admitted here? Many enthusiasticfriends of freedom think it cannot,but Iconfess I should fear the result of a vote taken onthat subject to-day. The man who folds his armsand says there is no danger, deceives himself, orwishes to deceive others. The proximity of slaveStates has given them all the advantages. If thelands unacquired of all the Indian shall be subjectedto pre-mation, I think a great majority willflock in from the free States; but if they arc openedto the speculator, I should be afraid that largebodies would be bought and cultivated by slave labor.The policy of slavery is to sell them to thehighest bidder; and the treaty with the Delawaresand some other tribes, requires their sale in thatmanner.' Mr. Speer is an intelligent man from Medina Co.,O., and formerly editor of the Medina Gazette.Since writing the above letter, we learn from theLorain Independent Democrat that he has returned.The editor of that paper says: Gazette. Independent Democrat 'We have just received a call from Mr. Speer,late of the Medina Gazette, who has located in Kansas.He gives a fine description of the country,and an indignant one of the arrogance of the Missouriansand government officials. Every governmentofficer is taken of course to be pro-slavery, andthe Missourians seem to regard any from the freeStates as intruders. Slaves are already in the territory,and are held legally as the masters and authoritiessay. No one pretends but that the Douglasbill renders slavery lawful, and the struggle isto abolish it. The anti-slavery settlers believe theywill have the power to do so, but invite their friendsto come on and help them. Gazette 'Mr. Speer is about establishing a paper in Lawrenceon the Kansas, and will return in a few days. SLAVERY IN KANZAS. A letter from a clergymanin Kansas, dated Nov. 5, speaks of slavery in thenew territory in this responding strain: LAVERY ANZAS. 'Let no one repeat that the strife is over—thatthere is no slavery in, or going into the Territory—the truth is just being here developed, that they arenow making the most determined efort to secureKansas to slavery. Especially are they now organizingto secure the first Legislature to their interest.It is not sure that we shall have an electionfor a Legislature this fall; I hope we shall not.If we do have, we shall be beaten be Missouri votersgoing over the line. If the subject can be postponeduntil another season, and we push forwardwith our enterprise, "I shall begin to hope."' or going into the Territory now determined first Legislature do I shall begin to hope.

 The preliminary examination of the alleged rioters inthe Batman outbreak, at Worcester, was terminated asthe ninth day. Messrs Stoddard, Hoar, Chapa and Thayer submittedtheir  to the Court without argument.  S.S. Foster proposed to sffer a few words, is explanationof his position in this  and of his relationsto the government. He declined to acknowledge thejurisdiction of this Court, because he had, years age,severed himself entirely from the government under theauthority of which it was established. He drew a distinctionbetween living under a government, and having aconnection with it. He said he was willing as a matterof expediency, to blind himself to appear beforeanother , and to submit to such  as itmight see fit to impose upon him; but, while he waswilling to do so, he would still maintain, so far as becould, his perfect independence of such . He haddeclined to adduce defensive testimony in this cae, andwould not do so at any stage of it. He relied upon hispast life and character as his defence against charges ofriot and violence. He believed the present to be a wicked and malicious one, got up for the of harassing and troubling the defendants. He believedthat the case had been prejudged, and, under thisbelief, he had cross-examined the evidence4 of the prosecution,simpl that he might present to the public mindthe  and falaity of the testimony—whether designedto be so or otherwise, he would not say. He was a nonresistant,and had been so for years; but he declared,that if he ever could be converted to the doctrines of violence,he would, upon the issue of slavery, go for abloody revolution.        Joseph A. Howland said that, so far as he could understand,this case had been prejudged, and for thisreason, he did not put in any defence. Mr. Matthews submitted the case for the governmentwithout argument. Judge Green summed up. He held that all the violencewhich took place on the 30th, was the result ofthe proceedings at the American House on the 29th.He compared the action of Messrs. Foster, Howland andThayer to that of incendiaries, who had set fire to theirneighbor's house, and then, when they saw that it waslikely to be consumed. attempted to extinguish theflames. He held that they intended to excite others toviolence on the 29th, and although they helped to rescueBatman, it was too late. In relation to Mr. Moody, it was proven that he wasat the American House about his legitimate business onSunday noght—that he accidentally met the crowd onFront street on Monday—and that he did all he couldto protect Butman, after he got into the crowd. In answerto the statements of Messrs. Foster and Howland,that they considered their cases prejudged from the beginning,the Court had nothing to say. These statementswere, certainly, not very complimentary to theCourt. The Court  only say, that it had endeavoredto try the case fully and fairly, without prejudiceor bins. The Court then went into a defence of itsruling, upon the exclusion of the wives of Messrs. Fosterand Howland as counsel, and stated that he did sobecause there was no precedent for women being admittedto practice in the courts of Massachusetts.  The Court then ordered that S.S. Foster, Joseph A.Howland, Adin Thaer, Alexander Hemingway, SolomonH. Dutton, and John Angier, Jr. severally to recognizein the sum of $500 each, for their appearancebefore the Court of Common Pleas, at the next Januaryterm. The Court held that Mr. Moody had been clearly,conclusively, and fully exonerated from any participationin the alleged riot, and he was discharged. S.S. Foster rose to take exception to some chargesthat had been made against him in the course of thetrial. The Court intimated that the case was closed.Mr. Foster then said, that he would have a meeting onSunday evening, where his lips would not be padlocked,and he challenged the Court to meet him there, and discussthe merits of this case. The Court intimated thatit never attended Mr. Foster's meetings, and worshipedin an entirely different place. Mr. Howland rose,and said the judge claimed the right to any what hepleased in court, without allowing them the privilegeof reply. He dared not meet them on a free platform. The defendants obtained bonds, and the Court adjourned. P.S. Rev. Theodore Parker, of boston, was summonedto appear before the U.S. Circuit Court on Wednesdaylast, and gave bail for his appearance to theamount of $1500, for trial in March next, on the chargeof being acessor to the Burns' riot in this city!!!

 A SOUTH SIDH VIEW OF PROSTITUTION; or, ThreeMonths in the  of Boston, in 1854. By Rev. Eves, D.D. pp.214, . Storestyped and published by  M. Raves, Boston. OUTH IDH IEW ROSTITUTION     The  have had their way upon this subjectlong enough; and we are happy to present to our the following shortract of a truly conservative the titleof this back may seem, to these who are seeking to subjectall our institution to the destructive pres ofwhat they call , its contents will present nothing with the well-knows piety and 'gravity' of either the author or the publisher.       Dr. Eves, (for many years post a popular orthodoxpreacher of the Sexes Street Church in Boston,) beingcalled, by sufficient reasons, to spend three months inthe society (favored indeed with the hospitality) of thebrothel-keepers of that ci9ty, felt moved to write a statementof his impressions respecting these people andtheir 'young ladies, * which should not only remove ordiminish the 'ill-fame' which has somehow fastened itselfupon them, but which should has relieve the minds ofthose good people who are distressed about the prevalenceof prostitution. * Having been misled by the publications of ' MoralReform' Societies, and especially by the writings ofMrs. Harriet Blackmore, Dr. Eves anticipated a severeshock to his sensibilities in this visit. He expected tosee the operatives wretched, ragged, vulgar and dirty;but of one thing be felt sure, namely, that the whole ofthem would be openly and grossly lascivious; and besupposed himself to have 'at least the average amountof information and ignorance with regard to the subject'Imagine then his surprise and gratification atthe following circumstances, occurring at his earliestopportunities of observation of these people:— operatives 'As two of them noticed my interested looks at them,ne whispered covertly to the other, and bother humor, andsome of them in a broad laugh: they were not sowretched as I expected: they were superior in genteelappearance to work-people of any other class in ourcities : a better-looking, happier, more courteous set ofpeople I had never seen : their language, even whenspeaking of objectionable with my notions of prostitution : Icould not have dreamed that these girls had been 'degraded,''their very womanhood crushed out of them,'&, as common report has so often asserted : and whenI asked, in amazement—Are they prostitutes? Certainly,said the friend at my side; they each belong to somehouse of ill-fame.' It was evident to Dr. Eves that he had been greatlymisled by preconceived opinions in relation to this classof people, yet he prudently remembered that thesemight be unusually favorable specimens, and kept hiseyes open for further observation. But this, when itcame, gave new causes of pleased astonishment. Hefound special 'good order' in the streets where thefashionable brothels were kept, and admired the wisdomthat closed the blinds, and otherwise cared for the externalquietness and respectability of those houses. He found that there was not so much time exactedfor the duties of their peculiar occupation as manysuppose; that a strong public feeling among the frequentersof those places protects the persons of theirinmates against annoyances and injuries; that one mancannot with impunity abuse another man's favorite;and that the disposition to avenge such wrongs 'amountsin many cases to a chivalric feeling.' He tells us that,by the employment of extra constables and policemenin their haunts, this whole class of our population are'in a condition most favorable to preservation fromcrimes against society' ; that girls who are indisposedto work of other kinds are saved by this system from' pauperism,' and that many quietly pursue their regularoccupation here, who would otherwise be a chargeupon the public in the ' house of correction.' On the point of 'Religious instruction,' the results ofDr. Eves's inquiries were eminently gratifying; forthough it was true (to a certain extent) that the breathe-keepersdid not like to have Bibles lying about indiscriminatelyin the rooms, and did not teach the girlsto read, and excluded tract-distributors and others whowished to reach them 'from motives of interference,'they read the Bible to them themselves, selecting theappropriate patriarchal and other portions in the OldTestament, and the comforting declaration, 'Neither doI condemn thee,' in the New, and making commentsadapted to their occupation and their stage of moraldevelopment. Moreover, it was found that the percentageof church-members among the girls in some ofthose houses was actually greater than that of eitherthe keepers who managed, or of the patrons who supportedthem. The Doctor does ultimately find, however, some 'revoltingfeatures' of prostitution. But, with thatcharity which hoppeth over all things objectionable ( inthe system which, on the whole, it chooses to defend),he tries hard to conquer his prejudices, suggests exculpatorycircumstances, even in the chapters headed 'Revoltingfeatures,' sympathises with the brothel-keepersas he enumerates the evils which 'they themselves deplore,'mourns over the difficulties they meet in givinga proper education to their own children and gives thisgentle rebuke to the opponents of the system :—'Sometimesthe demand seems to be that illicit connectionsshould be prevented at all events, and prostitutionnever be permitted. This is absurd, upon the least reflection.Let us not require too much in this matter.We must not be prejudiced by our associations with theword seduction. Let us not insist that female virtueshall never be sacrificed. This would be a most disastrousevent to the whole sex ; they would be debasedwithout measure, if this idea were acted on.' Of course, a clergyman does not leave such a subjectwithout bringing the instructions of Scripture to bearupon it. Dr. Eves finds prostitution regulated in boththe Old and New Testaments but not forbidden in either.He quotes numerous passages, and concludesthat, whatever may, at the first glance, look like prohibitionof it, refers to the abuses, and not to the relationitself. Coming, finally, to the inquiry what ( if any thing)is to be done in relation to prostitution, by those whoare now entirely unconnected with it, he answers, distinctlyand decidedly, Nothing. He informs us thatbrothel-keepers are the natural and proper protectorsof prostitutes ; that having been long familiar withtheir habits and characters, they know best whatshould be does for them, and will of course do it, ifnot interfered with; that their earnest desire andprayer, in relation to this whole business, is ' to be letalone'; and he feels entire confidence that, if thismoderate request be granted, they will do all that isnecessary in the premises; that is, prune off theabuses, and preserve the beneficent and scriptural relations.On the important subject of religious instruction,he feels confident that they are the best hudges ofwhat truth is needed, and what can be borne, by theirinmates : (doubtless, milk rather than strong meat,and in most cases, preferably skimmed milk :) he foundmany of the girls fond of singing, and possessing mostsweet and melodious voices ; true, he did not happento hear among them any of the songs of Zion ; but soliberal were the ideas of their keepers, that he feels nodoubt permission might be obtained for some reliableperson to attend and teach these, during the intervalsof their occupation ; and any minister in whom thekeepers could feel perfect confidence, might give religiousinteraction there, part of every Sabbath. perfect confidence Formerly, Dr. Eves tails us, the  and patressof these  had become as weary of the system as tohave even , of their own , a course of       sures for its remevel. Tired already of the expenes andtrouble of keeping large families of these girls, moreexpense and trouble were constantly required to catchthem when they ran away, and the particle above-mentionedwere just on the point of deciding to throw up thesystem altogether, when, hearing that some of theirneighbors perfectly agreed with them in opinion, andwandered that they hadn't made such a move before,they flew into a rege, revered their decision, and sworethat they would die sooner than give up the expensesand troubles in question. Dr. Even new assures us thatthis is their fixed and unalterable position; that themore any one wishes them to change their ground, themore they won't; and that, therefore, the more we objectto the idea and the practice of presentation, themore we must say nothing and do nothing against it.In fact, in relation to this subject, as to slavery andsome other matters, the only mode of effecting anythingis to do nothing. do nothing.

 To the Editor of the Manchester Weekly Advertiser: To the Editor of the Manchester Weekly Advertiser SIR—As an American abolitionist, it affords me pleasureto see your paper giving some prominence to thesubject of American slavery, even though not alwaysin my tone. Last weak, you had a notice of a recentwork relating to it, headed 'Dr. Marshall Hall onAmerican Slavery.' A few corrections seemed calledfor; and your former kindly bearing towards me and myarticles is a sufficient guarantees that this also will befavorably considered, and allowed an insertion. IR It was very cheering to hear you announce 'a regularEnglish agitation against American slavery.' Itwas sad, however, to find you almost deploring it; andfor such a reason as that it 'may lead to disastrous results,as respects the international relations with theUnited States.' Are we to have peaceful and friendlycommercial 'relations' only on condition that millionsof human beings continue in brute slavery—a state farworse than death? Would you and I, Mr. Editor, stepdown to that doom, with our mothers, sisters—all whoare dearest to us—would we waste away in those lingeringfires, only that such friendly relations be perpetuated?If, at such a price only can these results becontinued, then let them be sacrificed. Neither younor I would be a slave—an American slave above all—to save all the governments on the globe from utter annihilation;nor will I ever weigh the liberty of millionsof others, or one other, against such a comparative trifle.Your other reason against anti-slavery agitation is,that it may be disastrous to the slave himself. I thinkslavery is the most disastrous condition in which onecan be placed. Somebody said, 'Hanging is the veryworst use to which a man can be put.' It may be, nextto enslaving him. The war-cry of the American Revolutionwas— 'Give us liberty, or give us death.' Slaveryhas had few panegyrisers, until now, in the corruptionof modern times. Never did the nine muses inditeone hymn to its honor. Never did the mild harpof Northern minstrelsy, in all its long-buried melodies,nor the silver voices of southern syrens, attune onechorus in praise of the blood-swelled vampire. Butnow, when human fetters are forged by baptized hands,and human flesh hisses and smokes beneath the branding-ironof Gospel chattelship, are Christians foundsinging doxologies to its praise! And men, in God's ownimage moulded, are charitably consigned to bondageand turned to beasts, only for their own good. Youcommend Dr. Hall's book for some virtues, at whichthe slaveholders will laugh. Indeed, they enjoy thejoke greatly, always, when any one can be found makingsuch a defence of what they know cannot be defended,or apologized for, without giving, as the Earl of Chathamonce said, 'without giving justice and humanitytheir death.' But you speak of Dr. Hall's plan ofemancipation as original. You say, 'he has a schemeof his own, which seems to us to unite, in a singulardegree, simplicity and feasibility.' But scarcely was the American government founded,before many schemes of gradual emancipation wereproposed and considered ; this among the rest. And afew, a very few slaveholders, adopted it. And everyday of the year, since, contracts of this kind substantiallyare making between individual slaveholders andtheir slaves. In 1800, Henry Clay came forward witha scheme of gradual emancipation as wise as that ofDr. Hall's; but he was soon shamed and hissed into silence.In 1850, however, he had forgotten it; and inthe dotage of over seventy years, he renewed the proposition,with modifications. But it cost him the nominationfor the Presidency of the United States. Let mecaution Dr. Hall, and the editor of the ManchesterWeekly Advertiser, to hold back their views on thissubject, if they intend ever to emigrate to that country,with any political ambition as aspirants. When slave-holdersget ready to abolish slavery, they will want noadditional wisdom as to the best mode of doing it. Andthey would think Dr. Hall just as well employed inshowing them the best way to get rid of their Bibles, ortheir good weather, good health, or good digestion, asof their system of slavery. ManchesterWeekly Advertiser The travelled Doctor speaks of slavery in Louisianaas existing in a from less severe than in the other States;that it is serfdom instead of slavery, as in Russia.Without troubling you with any details about the awfulbrokerage in blood which is regularly carried on inNew Orleans and other parts of that State, by slavespeculators, let me give you an advertisement,—a volumein itself.

Dr. Hallshould walk barefoot to St. Petersburg in mid winter,and beg pardon of the Czar for naming his serfdom withAmerican slavery. I hope you will review your 'review'upon Dr. Hall in one other respect. You speak ofthe  nists as wasting their strength on the slaveholders,when the North is even worse in its treatmentof colored people than the South. Now, it happensthat these very Northern States are continually demandingwhy we don't go to the South, where slavery is.Our answer is, because the South only owns the slaves,while you of the North are the holders of them. Andso we work in the North, and upon the North. Andwe are giving he people of color equal rights as fast aspossible, while all the six New England States, withNew York, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, can testifythat, though much remain still to be done, our workhas by no means been in vain. And the slaveholderssee and confess, that in this very way we are bringingdeliverance to every bondman in the land.  Yours, most respectfully, PARKER PILLSBURY. Belfast, October, 1854.

I  not Doctor for trying, in all honorable ways, to such a charge; but I do not think his cause made any better by misrepresentation or cannot say but that the Doctor has told the in his late lecture; for, as you will oberve, he denied having uttered such sentiments in years ago, (three years prior to the passage of gitive Slave Act.) before that Association, and cluding other places and later times in But as it is the sentiment ascribed to //Doctor considers as the slander, and not the time where and when it was expressed, I that it helps the matter much, if he denpressed it in Boston, and it can be proved that it in Lynn.

It was the lecture, and all spoke of it, and no one and to this day I have heard of but one mas misunderstood differently.

 GREENFIELD, NOV. 20, 1854. REENFIELD OV. DEAR GARRISON: EAR ARRISON I came to this pleasant town last Wednesday, fromdown the river, Hartford-way, to hold some meetings.It has ever been a strong Whig town. Politically, asond-palsy had settled on the place. The overwhelming of the Monday previous had, for a time, heirts to stand still. Know-Nothingism swept the State like a besom of destruction to ad Democracy; and of these latter, there enough left of their dead bodies even to make aThere was nothing left to bury.       It was well I came in at that hour, to rally the palenergies of the people, and give them something to attention from the final doom of a long-I own Hall, it having two apartments—the upper, Hall, which will hold a thousand or fifteen and a lower, or Franklin Hall, which will as many. Meetings were appointed in hall for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to discuss the question of Human Nature. be future of the human race a better organisationhad a letter development of that improved orand thus to people the earth with a nobler women, wre the practical questions to Temperance, Non-Resistance, Anti-Slavery institutions in Church and State, and all political, social and theological rewere to be considered, in their bearings on the character and destiny of man.                 Two meetings were held Wednesday and Thursday and attended by many of the most intelligentinfluential people of the place. Friday, I had man and deeply attached enemy—Ague Friday evening, I had no meeting; decided t hall meetings all day Sunday, in the evening, in the upper hall. I made my Charles L. Fiske, whom I first met in Chapfifteen years ago, then at work on his bench He was then deliberating about joining for reply, that if he truly loved his feland wished to bless them, he would be and cherished in his spiritual life in much as a new-born infant would in a He joined the church, was it four years, with some twenty others, came out, that he work more earnestly and efficiently for the downand for humanity in all directions. he has been free to be and to do good.

He is and led the Old Folk's Concert recently held place, which has excited, justly, much interest one hundred and fifty, old and young, composingthe chair, and the tunes selected from 'Ancient Revived,' in which you, friend Jackson, and others, so often perform our devotions in Boston.   deeply attached                 Eclectic         F evening, instead of a public meeting, several at Dr. Fiske's to sing—among them, Mr. a composer of some fine music, and who has volume of music, in connection with EmBoston. It was decided to have an anti-slavery Sunday evening, in the large Town Hall, the choir of Old Folks and Young Folks wouldmeet and sing. So, Saturday evening, they met againat the  to sing. Mr. Dewey, W.T. Davis, brother(Hon. G.T. Davis, and several others of the bestsingers, were present, and a good time we had.         Sunday evening came, and the choir—about fifty,old and young—Judge Sanger, of the Court of CommonPleas now in session here, Dewey, Davis, &, being ofthem—the anti-slavery lecturer and the audience, tohear, and to enjoy, and to be benefited. The singing,led by Dr. Fiske, began at six and continued till seven.Then a lecture on slavery, especially in its bearings ondomestic relations and endearments, showing how it where human beings are created anddeveloped. Then, after the lecture, the choir sangsome twenty minutes longer. It was, indeed, a happyscene. Would that you and Francis Jackson had beenthere to enjoy and to help. Many old folks and young were there, and their hearts blended in loving harmonyaround the domestic shrines of the past; and theawakened sympathy was all directed to the desolatedhomes and blighted hearts of the slaves.   How sweet, in our wanderings, and in life's tumultsand stern warfare, is the memory of childhood's home, and blessed by the tender love and care melody of father and mother and brother andsister. How terrible to have that home made desolate, friend, know by a deep and tearful experience.A starving man, along, can know the value ofbread. A deep, tender, loving heart, that yearns, in for love in all its sweetest manifestations, made light and beautiful by affection, can know the deepest depths of suffering and bereavementwhen such a home is suddenly made desolate.We may you feel for the slave. He knows no home. love and care of a father bless not his childit warmed and cherished by a mother's Home is but another name for earth's and most intense anxiety to the slave. slave has been felt by you.

I went to Deerfield the other day, withthe Doctor, to call on a patient ninety-three years old—being on the spot where Pastor Williams lived, whenthe Indians surrounded him and family, dashing out theburns of two of hischildren on the door-stone, andtaxing him, wife and surviving children, to Montreal.That old man, Dickinson by name, related many scenesof by gone days.

Are there not men andwomen, who, without stopping to be commissioned andpaid by Anti-Slavery Societies, will go forth, and, inthe name of God and humanity, preach the Gospel ofNO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS—the only power ofGod and wisdom of God to save this people from impendingruin? Know-Nothing will be Do-Nothings.Not one word have they yet spoken against slavery—as a party. They dare not: it would instantly makethem a Northern party to do so, and this, they haveno wish to be.

In a certain land, (whether far or near,Where the sun shines warm, or the snows are drear,It matters not to my purpose here,)Is a curious population:In form and features they seem like men;In altitude many are five feet ten;They know the why, and the how, and the when,Of the birth of our 'glorious nation;'They have ears to hear, they have tongues to talk'They have eyes to see, they have feet to walk;And, from certain facts that occur each day,I think that I may venture to sayThey have somehow the will, and have learned the wayOf human propagation;So we take it for granted, beyond all doubt,That this curious race will not run outWith the present generation.                 The thing that is queer about this folk,(You may think that I do, but I do not joke,)They act as if all their backs were broke,And to stand up straight, like a sturdy oak,Were beyond their capability.They can crawl in the dirt on their hands and knees,They can lick the dust whit marvelous ease,When their lords take snuff they are ready to sneeze,And from zero will slump through their thirty degressWith a wonderful felicity:When their misters cry 'Down!'With a scowl and a frown,They would not dare to hint that their souls are theirown:When their masters cry 'Up!'They will start like a pop,Or the 'Dotheboy's starvelings when 'Squeers' filledthe cup;And if anything mean is required to be done,'Tis amazing to see how this gentry will run,As if serving the devil was capital fun,And their highest attainment servility.  do                     In the pulpit you'll find them—a singular plce,Perhpas you will say, for so plisant a race;But the fact is, mistaking poltrosnery for grace,They regard themselves 'called' and 'relocated'As 'watchmen of Zion,' whose care is to keepAll wolves (but themselves) from the fold and thesheep,And to watc and to prey, (while their dupes areasleep,)And 'between porch and altar' to howl and to weep.With a seal and a sorrow affected,'Gainst 'sin in the abstract' they thunder like Paul,But for sin in the concrete care nothing at all:For crimes long forgotten,And scoundrels long rotten,Their lash theologic has snapper and know on;For the rest—they are nice in the choice of thier evils,The big ones rejecting—The small ones electing—(Though both might be large to another's inspecting,)And the god they adore is—'the least of two devils.'        prey              Into stations once filled by the good and the wise,By arts demagogic they manage to riseOn a ladder whose rundles are liquor and lies,And convert our Congressional halls into styesMade foul wiht themselves and their stenches:The simple may think, while they list to their prate,That they 'love the dear people,' and 'cherish theState:'All true—if you strike out the nouns from the line,And substitute for them loose women and wine,'Or, 'cocktails, and gambling and wenches.'Eight dollars per dayIs indifferent payFor the manifold labors that come in their way;Such, for instancs, as dodging a 'Yea' or a 'Nay,'By dodging their heads under benches;Making speeches 'for Buncombe,' excessively flat,That baffle all guesses at what tehy are at,Or rolicking home 'with a brick in their hat,'As tipsy and jolly as Bacchus:Or, worse, eating dirt, as their masters my bid,Playing jackall or spaniel, as Ing—rs—II did,Or, like T—o—y, enacting the jackass!         nouns               Sometimes you will find them in the chairOf a Circuit Judge or a city Mayor—And, then, good Lord! how the people stareTos ee what the Dorsosne will dareWith the sanction of legality!How keen their vision t find a flawIn the charter of rights—in God's own law—How prompt to give to the spoilers mawThe helpless wretch who is branded 'slave,'By a Southrn nabob's purchased knave,Who would steal the shroud from his mother's grave,And boast of his rascality:It is not htat they love the dirty job,Or think it an 'abstract right' to rob,Or safe with the devil to play hob-nob,If they look to their own 'finality,'    Dorsosne          love   safe  Oh, no!—but the hones of their backs and kneesGrow limber by stopping, and weak by degrees,Now bend as an oxier would bennd to the breeze—(The breeze that beads them has an odor of cotton)—And they can't stand erect without stamen or pith,Videlicet H—ll—tt, and L—r—ng, and Smith,And C—rt—ss, and C—sh—ng, and more of their kith,Some dead—perhaps damned—and the whole ofthem rotten.    them   Videlicet   whole  'Tis a numerous race, I am sorry to say,Of which I have rend you a rhyme to-day,And most, if not all, are in Beelzebub's pay,And himself and his imps they re prompt to obey,Though the wages he not to their notion.Some, members of Congress—some, judges—and someAre peddlers of cambric—and others, or rum—Some are dogs of that breed which the Bible calls'dumb,'And their caudal appendage wags thanks for a crumb,'With a short, uneasy motion:'Some write for the papers—and scores upon sooresAre clerks in departments, or partners in stores—And rowdies, and blacklegs, and gamblers, and bores,And what nots—beyoung my computing;All crouching, and cringing, and creeping—but noneOf the motly assemblage can claim a back-bone,Or his soul (when th wind's from the South) as hisown;Or should he, such claim (it were easily shown)Would hardly be worth the refuting.                 back-bone     FUZZY GUESY.

 DEAR FRIEND GARRISON: EAR RIEND ARRISON I feel a deep and earnest desire to say a few wordson one or two subjects, which I feel are of greet importanceto the spread of that truth which in alone tomake mankind free. Very often, in conversation withfriends on the subject of slavery, have I been told thatGarrissniann did not believe in any government at all;but I have explained to them the viewer of yourself andothers, as I understood them, saying that they did believein A government based upon principle—which itis not necessary now to stop to explain. Our dearfriend LUCY STONE, in a recent speech (in LIBERATOR,Nov. 10.) uses the following language:—'I do think,that if ever there was a time when we should demand aNorthern Republic, it is now.' Who that has lookedinto the history of governments, ever since we heard ofa government, can have the least hope that mankindcan be saved by government, or political bastion? Governmentis wrong all wrong, and it to utterly Impossibleto make it right. Where is the hope that the peopleof the North can do any better at governmentmaking than any other people? What are they?Slaveholders, all of them, with very few exceptions.What does WM. LLOYD GARRISON, or HENRY C. WRIGHT,or LUCY STONE, want of a government to tell themWhat ia right? They know already what to right andwhat to wrong. Garrissniann UCY TONE IBERATOR uses wrong North M. LOYD ARRISON ENRY RIGHT UCY TONE Where, in the past history of man, have we any thingto give us faith to believe that man can govern his fellow-man?And what right has one man to make lawsfor another? He cannot do it. There never was agovernment, nor can be, where man can be free. Whatit government? O, it is enough to make a heart ashard at stone weep to think of it. Look at the terriblebattle of Alma! That is government. Who foughtthat battle? Brother-men—no worse than the peopleof Massachusetts or Maine. I tell you friends, wecannot trust our fellow-men with power ever one another.I know it will be said that we will not have painsand penalties attached to disobedience. I tell youagain, friends, you cannot form a government whereinmankind can be left free. Government to nothing buta  of confusion, and ever will be so. I have nota particle of faith that, if the Union were dissolved,we should form a government where man can be leftfree. What are governments for? For the benefit ofthe people? Never! Governments are for the few, tomake slaves of the musses. All governments are amighty incubus the people. Remove them, and theywill arise and begin to live for the purpose for whichthey were formed. Government in the hands of thepeople is all wrong; government in the hearts of thepeople is right. right government.  few musses. hands hearts 'He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,And all are slaves besides.'  Mankind cannot be free under any kind of a government. One word more on another subject of great importance to the spread of truth. In THE LIBERATOR ofNov. 17 is a letter of our dearly-beloved friend, PARKERPILLSHURY, to the Scottish  in which he says,'The Rer. Mr. MAY, of Boston,' & Who is Rev. Mr.May? I am well acquainted with SAMUEL MAY, Jr.,and esteem him very highly. But who is Retv. Mr.May? This is not the first time that I have thought ofthis thing. That SAMUEL MAY Jr., pretches a truegospel. I know. But why does he allow that absurdtitle to be put to his name? It seems to me that everyman ought to be satisfied to be called by his real name.Friend May does not properly belong to that class ofpeople who are called Rev's. Then why not at once andfor ever disclaim it I think all would love him more;surely, I should. All titles and handles and must be banished from among men, before therecan be peace on earth, or the arrival of the good timecoming. Thorn let us not strive for nor wear any titles.nor have any government but the government of God.Then shall there be a universal brotherhood of peace onearth and good will among men.

 We have been favored (says the Life Illustrated ) bythe Messrs. Mason, Brothers, the publishers of theforthcoming Life of Horace Greeley, with a glance atsome of the proof sheets of that work; it will be a volumeof fascinating interest, and one that will do good.We are permitted to extract a passage for the entertainmentof our readers. Life Illustrated At sunrise, on Friday, the eighteenth day of August.1831. Horace Greeley landed at Whitehall,close to the Battery, in the city of New York. New York was, and is, a city of adventurers.Few of our eminent citizens were born here Itis a common boast among New Yorkers that thisgreat merchant and that great millionaire came tothe city a ragged boy, with only three and sixpencein Lis pocket; and now look at him? In a list ofthe one hundred men who are estemed to be themost 'successful' among the citizens of NewYork, it is probable that seventy-five of the nameswould be those of men who began their careerhere in circumstances that gave no promise of futureeminence. But among them all it is questionablewhether there was one who on his arrivalhad so little to help, so much to binder him, asHorace Greeley. Lis now estemed Of solid cash, his stock was ten dollars. Hisother property consisted of the clothes he wore,the clothes he carried in his small bundle, and thestick with which he carried it. The clothes hewore need not be described: they were those whichhad already astonished the people of Erie. Theclothes he carried were very few, and preciselysimilar in cut and quality to the garments whichhe exhibited to the public. On the violent suppositionthat his  could in any case havebecome a  commodity. we  computethat he was worth, on this Friday morning, atsunrise, ten dollars and seventy-five cents. Hehad no friend, no acquaintance here. There wasnot a human being on whom he had any claim forhelp or advice. His appearance was all againsthim. He looked in this round jacket like an overgrownboy. No one was likely to observe the engagingbeauty of his face, or the noble round ofhis brow under that overhanging but. over thatlong and stooping body. He was somewhat timorousin his interstice with strangers. He wouldnot intrude upon their attention; he had not thefaculty of pushing his way. and proclaiming hismerits and desires. To the arts by which men areconciliated, by which unwilling ears are forced toattend to an unwelcome tale, he was utterly astranger. Moreover, he had neglected to bringwith him any letters of recommendation or anycertificate of his skill as a printer. It had notoccurred to him that any thing of the kind wasnecessary, so unacquainted was he with the lifeof cities. Erie.    overhanging but. timorous His first employment was to find a boardinghouse where he could live a long time on a small Leaving the green Battery on his left hand,of that street and Well discovered a house that inhis eyes had the aspect of a cheap tavern.

A buses, which combined the low groggeryand the cheap  house in one smallestablishment, kept by as richman named M'Gorlick,chanced to be the  that first attracted the attraction. It looked so mean and squalid,that he was tempted to enter, and again inquirefor what sum a man could buy a week's shelterand sustenance.                         'Twenty shillings,' was the landlord's reply.'Ah.' said . 'that sounds more like it.'   He engaged to heard with Mr. M'Gorlick on theinstant, and proceeded soon to test the quality ofhis fire by taking breakfast in the  of hisfamily. The  of the entertainment wasits best recommendation.   After breakfast, Hence performed as set whichI believed he had never spontaneously performedbefore. He bought some clothes, with a view torender himself more . They were ofthe commonest kind, and the garments were few,but the purchase  nearly half his capital.Satisfied with his appearance, he now began theround of the printing-offices, going into every onehe could find, ad asking for employment—nerelyasking, and going away, without a word, assoon as he was refused. In the course of the morning,he found himself to the office of the journal ofCommerce, and he chanced to direct his inquiry, ifthey wanted a hand, to the late David Hale, oneof the proprietors of the paper. Mr. Hale tooka survey of the person who had presumed to addresshim, and replied in substance as follows:—   My opinion is, young man, that you're a runawayapprentice, and you'd better go home toyour master.' Horace endeavored to explain his position andcircumstances, but the impetuous Hale could hebrought to no more gracious response than,' Beoff about your business, and don't bother us.' Horace, more amused than indignant, retired,and pursued his way to the next office. All thatday he walked the streets, climbed into upper stories,came down again, ascended other heights,descended, dived into basements, ever asking thesame question. 'Do you want a hand!' and overreceiving the same reply, in various degrees of civility,'No'. He walked ten times as many milesas he needed, for he was not aware that nearlyall the printing-offices in New York are in thesame square mile. He went the entire length ofmany streets which any body could have told himdid not contain one. He went home Friday evening very tired anda little discouraged. Early on Saturday morning, he resumed thesearch, and continued it with energy till the evening.But no one wanted a hand. Businessseemed to be a stand-still, or every office had itsfull complement of men. On Saturday evening,he was still more fatigued. He resolved to remainin the city a day or two longer, and then, if stillunsuccessful, to turn his face homeward, and inquirefor work at the towns through which hepassed. Though discouraged, he was not disheartened,and still less alarmed. The youthful reader should observe here what asense of independence and what fearlessness dwellin the spirit of a man, who has learned the art ofliving on the mere necessaries of life. If HoraceGreeley had, after another day or two of trial,chosen to leave she city, he would have carriedwith him about four dollars : and with an obnoxiousheart, all the way back to his fathershouse, six hundred miles, inquiring for work atevery town, and feeling himself to be a free andindependent American citizen, travelling on hisown honestly-earned means, undergraded by anobligation, the equal in social rank of the bestman in the best house he passed. Blessed is theyoung man who can walk thirty miles a day, anddine contentedly on half a pound of crackers!Give travel and revel like a prince incognito for forty.  On Sunday morning, our hero arose, refreshedand cheerful. He went to church twice, and spenta happy day. In the morning, he induced a manwho lived in the houses to accompany him to asmall Universality church in Pitt street, near theDry Dock, not less than three miles distant fromM'Gorlick boarding-house. In the evening, hefound his way to a Unitarian church. Except onone occasion, he had never, before this Sunday,heard a sermon which recorded with his own religiousopinions : and the pleasure with which heheard the benignity of the Deity asserted andenjoyed. In the afternoon, as if in reward of the piousway in which he spent the Sunday, he heard newswhich gave him a faint hope of being able t remainin the city. An Irishman, a friend of thelandlord, came in the courses of the afternoon topay has usual Sunday visit, and became acquaintedwith Horse and his fruitless search for work.He was a shoemaker. I believe, but he lived in ahense much frequented by journeymen printers.From them he had heard that hands were wantedat West's, No. 85 Chatham street, and he recommendedhis new acquaintance to make immediateapplication at that office. Accustomed to country hours, and eager to seizethe chance. Horace was in Chatham streat and onthe steps of the designated house by half-past fiveon Monday morning. West's printing office wasin the second-story, the ground floor being occupiedby McElrath and Bange as a bookstore. Theywere publishers, and West was their printer.Neither store nor office was yet opened, and Horaceact down on the steps to wait. Had Thomas McElrath, Esquire, happened topass on an early walk that morning, and seen ourhere sitting on the steps, with his red bundle onhis knees, his  face supported on his hands,his attitude expressive of dejection and anxiety,his attire extremely unornamental, it would nothave occurred to Thomas McElrath, Esquire, as aprobable event, that one day he would he the PARTNERof that SORRY figure, and proud of the connection!Nor did Miss Reed, of Philadelphia, whenshe saw Benjamin Franklin pass her father'shouse, eating a large roll and carrying two othersunder his arms, see in that poor wanderer anylikeness of her a proud and an immortal wife. Theprinces of the throne, and, doubtless, the ComingMan, when he comes, will appear in a strangedisguise, and no man will know him.  probable It seemed very long before any one came to workthat morning at No. 85. The steps on which ourfriend was seated were in the narrow part of Chatbamstreet, the gorge through which, at morningand evening, the swarthy tide of machanies pours.By six o'clock the stream has set strongly down-town-ward,and it gradually swells to a torrent,height with the kettles. Thousands passed by,but no one stopped till nearly seven o'clock, whenone of Mr. West's journey men arrived, and findingthe door still locked, he  down on the stepsby the side of Horace Greeley. They fell intoconversation, and Horace stated his circumstances,something of his history, and his need of employment.Luckily, this journeyman was a Vermonter,and a kind-hearted, intelligent man. He lookedupon Horace as a countryman, and was struckwith the singular candor and artlessness withwhich he told his tale. 'I saw,' says he,' that hewas an honest, good young man, and being a Vermontermyself, I determined to help him if I could.'  He did help him. The doors were opened ; themen began to arrive : Horace and his newly-foundfriend ascended to the office, and soon after seventhe work of the day began. It is hardly necessaryto say, that the appearance of Horace, as hesat in the office waiting for the coming of the foreman,excited astonishment, and brought upon hisfriend a variety of  observations. Nothing, however, on the arrival of the foreman,he stated the case, and  to intervenehim enough that the work for which a man waswanted n the office was the composition of a Testament—a kind of work which is extremelydifficult and tedious. Several man hadtried their hand at it, and in a few days or a fewhours given it up. The foreman looked at Horace,and Horace looked at the foreman. Horace saw ahandsome man ( new known to the sporting publicas Cultural Pulper, editor of the spirit of the ).The freman behind a youth who could have goneup the stage, that minutes, as  ,without the alteration of a thread or a hair, andbrought down the house by his ' getting up' along.He no more  that  set up apage of  testament than that he could atrust a chrumometer.

After Horses had been at work an hour or own,Mr. West. the 'hose,' cams into the office. Whathis feelings were, when he saw his new man, maybe inferred from a little conversation upon thesubject which took place between him and theforeman. 'Did you hire that demand fool!' asked West,with no small irritation. 'Yes: we must have hands, and he's the best Icould get,' said the foreman, justifying his conduct,though he was really ashamed of it. 'Well,' said the master, 'for God's sake, payhim of to-night, and let him go about his business.'

When I sawthe tragic, codfishy expression of his eyes, I wassurprised; when I observed the flexibility of hiscapacious mouth, opening and shutting like adying mudsucker, I was amassed. When my eyeturned to his fingers, which worked and clutchedas if feeling for coppers in a dark closet, I waswonder stricken; but when my attention was calledto the magnitude of his legs, I was fairly electrifiedwith imagination and could not forbear asking BullDogge if those calves were capable of locomotion.The admiring audience which had kicked up a perfectyoung earthquake, when he came on, onlyceased when he squared himself, put out his arm,and prepared to speak. That voice! Ye gods!that voice! It went through gradations that humanvoice never before attempted, imitating byturns the horn of City Hall Gabriel, the shriek ofthe locomotive, the soft and gentle tones of a fortyhorse-power steam saw-mill, the loving accents ofthe scissor-grinder's wheel, the amorous tones ofthe charcoal man, the rumble of the omnibus, thecry of the driver appertaining thereto— rising fromthe entrancing notes of the infuriated house dog tothe terrific cry of the oyster vonder. 'Several times during the piece, I was much affected— when he wound his arms around his wife,stuck his head over her shoulder, and kissed theback of her neck— when he made a grand exit,with three stamps, a hop, a run, and two longstraddles— when he talked grand about the thunder,and shook his fist at the man in the flies—when he killed the soldiers in the council room,shouted for them to "come one and all," and thenrun away for fear they would— when he swore atthe man who did not give him his cue— when heknelt down and said grace over his dead boy, andthen got up and struck his wife with the butcher'sknife; but in no part of the whole piece was I soimpressed with his pathetic power, his transcendentgenius, as when he laid his hand solemnly uponhis stomach and said, " What-a-bore, O cannotlie." (Damphool asked in a whisper if Othello'soccupation was gone.) 'At the death scene, when he was shot, I wasagain touched to the heart; first he wabbledabout like a top-heavy liberty pole in a high wind;then he stuck out one leg, and wiggled it afterthe manner of a galvanic bull-frog; then sat downon the floor, opened his eyes, and looked around;then grappled an Indian on one side, clutched asoldier on the other; struggled to his feet, staggered about like a drunken Dutchman; made arush forward, then a leap sideways; stiffened outlike a frozen pig, collapsed like a wet dish-cloth,exerted himself till his face was the color of anunderdone beefstake, then sunk back into thearms of the Indians, whispered to let him downeasy, rolled up the whites of his eyes, settled himselfto die, concluded to have a parting curse atthe surrounding people, took a long swear, laiddown, and a noise in his throat like castanets, acouple of vigorous kicks, and a feeble grunt, gaveup the ghost. 

 Mr. Doesticks having exhausted the amusementsof the theatre, the opera, the museum, and theconcerts tried the church. The following is hisaccount of the music:— 'Pretty soon music— organ— sometimes grandand solemn, but generally fast and lively enoughfor a contra dance. He commenced to play OldHundred. At first majestic as it should be, butsoon his left hand began to get unruly among thebass notes, then the right cut up a few monkeyshines in the trouble; left threw in a large assortmentof quavers; right lief off with a grand flourishand a few dozen of variations; left struggledmournfully to keep up, but soon gave out deadbeat, and after that went back to first principles,and hammered away vigorously at Old Hundred.in spite of the antics of its fellow; right struck upa march— marched into a quickstep— quickstep intoa gallop; left still kept at Old Hundred; rightput in a few bars of a popular walts: leftwavers a little; right strikes up a favorite polkas:left evidently yielding; right dashes into a jig; leftnow fairly deserts its colors, and goes over to theenemy, and both commence an animated hornpipe,leaving poor Old Hundred to take care of itself.At length, with a crash, a squeak, a rush, a roar,a ruinable, and an expiring groan, the overture concludedand service began. 'At length, with another variety upon the organ,and all the concentrated praise and thanksgivingof the congregation sung by four persons,the service concluded. I thought, from the mannerof the last performance, each member of thechoir imagined the songs of praise would never getto heaven, if he didn't give them a personal boost,in the shape of an extra yell.'
