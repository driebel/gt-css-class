 The people of Kansas, whose rights have been outragedby Missouri ruffians and outlaws, have petitionedCongress for redress. Congress must inquire into thematter. That inquiry will establish all that has beencharged, and must result in the dissolution of the territoriallegislature, or at least in the rejection of theiracts, which art bat the doings of a horde of lawlesstyrants. A bill mast be introduced to punish suchvillany hereafter. Bat will the slave tyrants allow it topass? Is not the Kansas scoundrelism the true spiritof slavery, with its drapery a little rent?

 LECTURER by MRS.  L ROSS On Sundayafternoon last, Mrs. R L. ROSS, of New York, gavea very uld and the address on slavery, to a highlyappreciative audience, in the Lecture depicted of the MusicHall, in this city. She forcibly depicted the witheringinfluences of that terrible system upon the members,morals, habits, industry and enterprise of the people ofadministered a scathing to rebuke to Northern servility tothe Slave Power, by which alone that Power in conbledto maintain an existence on the American soil. ECTURER RS.  OSS OSS  Mrs. Rose lectured again in the evening, at the sameplace on, the subject of Woman s' Rights. She speak forearly two hours, without notes or reference to anymanuscript, with great vigor of appeal, power of reasoning,and masterly ability, hoping the unbroken attentionof her studies to the sad, and  frequentexpressions of approbation Mrs. Ross is onethe most natured, dignified, intelligent and offensivespeakers, and, for one born and  in Pealed,speaks our language with astonishing presides and accuracy.She ought to have had much faller houses.   

 The history of party is the history of opinions;and for the last twenty years in the United States,it has been scarcely more than the history of AbolitionFrom the origin of the Government to thepresent time, the antagonism between the Northand the South has been steadily developing itselfin all the departments of feeling and of thought—in sunderingreligious associations, controlling literature,and embittering section against section.To counterpart this antagonism all sorts of expedientshave been tried. Party organizations, patchedup truces, and shallow compromises, have allhad their day and have all fallen beneath the violenceof an inborn, incurable, hopeless malady. TheNorth and South there never one people, and nothingcan ever make them so. TheNorth and South there never one people, and nothingcan ever make them so. The earlier infestations of this antagonism tooka somewhat different form from that which it nowassumes. Bounties, tariffs and discriminations infavor of the North, and against the South, werebut the faults of the same germ—sectional lust—and theirtendency was, by robbing the South ofthe just rewards of her labor, to impoverish andweaken her, and thus prepare the way for Abolitionitself. High tariffs and Abolition were butparts of the same policy. Hence the Whig party,which began with the principle of protection, soonbecame at the North the organ of Anti-Slavery, andcontinued to sink deeper and deeper into it, untilthat wing abandoned its own national platform,and went over, 'horse, foot and dragoons, to theAbolitionists. It is curious, too, to remark, thatas the principles of protection grew weaker, untilin 1852, the Whig Convention practically ignoredit in its platform that of Abolition was steadily inthe ascendant. Henry Clay, its renowned leader,was them stretched upon his dying bed, and Webster'sconservatism was fast tottering beneath theintolerant fanaticism of Seward. The Whig partystood so long as its Northern and Southern wingsrefrained from sectional tests. The tariff was nota sectional test. It had its friends in both sectionsof the Union. But Abolition was a sectional test,and hence the Northern Whig party, as it graduallybecame more a abolitionized, grew stronger atthe North and weaker at the South. As a nationalparty it fell, after having exhausted every expedientto preserve its existence. It fell because Anti-Slaveryat the North is stronger than Whiggery—becauseit can no longer control the latent antagonismbetween the North and South. Northern Whig It fell because Anti-Slaveryat the North is stronger than Whiggery The Democratic party, too, at the North, has hadin itself the same element of dissolution. It yieldedto the same sectional lust when It passed theTariff of 1828, the Force bill, enacted the TariffCompromise of '32 and violated it in 42. It hadalways a greater support in the South, because itavowed the immortal doctrine of State-Rights andFree-Trade. In 1838, before Abolition had yet acquiredfull force it passed in the Senate the Athertonresolutions, denying the right of Congress tointerfere with slavery; and a few years after, whenAbolition sentiment had more entirely seized uponthe North, it threw open the doors of Congress, bythe repeal the twenty-first rule, to petition aggressiveand insulting to the South. The poisonof Northern sectionalism was gradually workingits way. In 1856 the Tariff was modified: the antagonismon this point had grown weaker, and theslavery issue loomed up more fiercely than ever.Slavery was excluded from Oregon by a DemocraticAdministration, and Wilmot, a PennsylvaniaDemocrat, introduced his famous Proviso. It wasthe first attempt to exclude the South from thecommon territory. It laid hare the designs of theNorth, and the most Union-loving men in the Southfelt there was danger ahead from their Northernalliance. When the next Presidential canvassopened, both Whig and Democratic parties attemptedto cast out this element of sectional discord;and restore their last nationality. The slaveryquestion was method over in their platforms,and pledges of peace given in exchange for thesuport of the South. They were accepted, andWhiggery, every were strengthened by Southernersconfidence in a Southern man, elected GeneralTaylor to the presidency. He proved false to hispledges, false to his constitutional oath, and falseto the South, when he erected California, by militaryusurpation, into a free State. The disposalof the territories acquired from Mexico next broughtup the issue. The Compromise followed, in whichthe attempt was again made to stifle the antagonismand save the Union. Pledged to its support,both parties went into the last election for PresidentThe Democrats carried the day, and PresidentPierce was elected, With the hope of drivingAbolition forever from the floors of Congress, theNorthern Democrats brought forward the Nebraska bill.The Missouri Compromise Line, whichthe South had repeatedly tendered to the North assettlement of the question, but which they steadilyrespected, was repealed, and the lauded Unionsaving principles of the Compromise of 1850 reenactedin the Nebraska hill. But Anti-Slavery,which in 1820 eagerly acceded to the MissouriLine, and in 1850 robbed the South, by this sameCompromise, of all her Territories, had grown tooinsolent and powerful now to listen to any furthercompromises. Squatter sovereignty was good doctrinewhereby to exclude the South. but a foulwrong when by it she might colonize Kansas. Andwhat has been the result' The Democratic party,which, like thw Whig, had been struggling in preservethe nationality, finds itself at last overwhelmed by thenational issue, and utterly broken up by Abolition.—These remains no common platform upon whicheither the Whig or the Democratic party can unitetheir Northern and Southern wings. All hope ofnational organizations, on the basis of either isshown to be hopeless by the history of the Northduring the past year The antagonism has triumphed. The Democratic party,which, like thw Whig, had been struggling in preservethe nationality, finds itself at last overwhelmed by thenational issue, and utterly broken up by Abolition. South was the state of the old parties, when,about a year ago, the Know Nothing Order firstmade its mark in the politics of the country. Itpronounced the old parties effete and rotten. Itproposed to bury and the old issues which had dividedthe North and the South, and to erect upon theirgrave a grand, comprehensive, national idea, whichwould override all sectional differences, and givepeace and security to the Union. Sick as men wereof the old parties disgusted at their vain expedients,and lured by its peculiar principles, the newparty gathered to its folds many adherents. We did not care now to question the justice ofthe antagonism which this party assumes, to existbetween the native and foreign born, and whichconstitutes the chief basis of its organization. Weare willing to accept it as a fact. Yet, what dowe see? It excludes the foreign element, becausewe are supposed to be radical, disturbing and antagonisticto a stable nationality, and asserts that thenative born are the only true friends of order, conservatism,and the Union. We have the history ofthe past six months before us to test these principles.The election at the North came on, and everywherethe 'Fasten' between Abolition and theNew Order carried the day. The faith of Southernmen began to tremble. What hopes could behad of a National party at all acceptable to theSouth, which signalized its first triumphs in alliancewith Free Soilers? But still the cry was kept up.We still heard of the great American, national organization,in which the Slavery question was tobe buried forever. This affiliation with Free Soilerswas only a local affair. The MassachusettsLegislature, in which the Know Nothings were omnipotent,met, and in a few short weeks has givento the world a record of fanaticism, of disgustingrowdyism and shame, which the most degenerateposterity will blush to peruse. In the frenzy ofAbolition, they have attempted to make the Judiciary,that great stronghold of liberty, the vassaland tool of mob fanaticism; and they are about tonullify the Fugitive Slave law. The same Council for the State of New Yorkhave turned their bucks upon an effort made byMR. Fillmore and his friends to stifle the slaveryissue in this organization. We might pile proofupon proof to the same effect. Anti-Slavery will'not go down 'at the North. A party, organizedto put down an influence, said to be hostile to theUnion, has itself fallen prey to the same evil! Aparty which was to kill sectional differences andconsolidate the Union, has in its first victoriesstricken down religious freedom, independence ofthe Judiciary, and raised a fiercer war againstthe South then ever before. There remains no hopeif a National Know Nothing Organization, Thatparty has gone the way of the Whig and Democraticparties. Anti-Slavery will'not go down 'at the North. There remains no hopeif a National Know Nothing Organization What is the lesson taught! The North will notabandon the schemes of Abolition. Fanaticism isstronger than parties, and national organizationsare impossible which refuse to bow before it. Themask which men for thirty years have been throwingover the hideous forms of Anti-Slavery has fallenoff, and unappeased, and unappeasable it presentsitself for deadly combat with the South.—That the South can touch a national organizationwhich strikes at slavery, is not to be thought ofThe day of national parties is therefore at an end.Anti-Slavery and aggression upon the South controlthe North. Must they not destroy the Union!

An old workhorse stands just below the town; hewas taken there, his head was shaved, his face blackedhe was tarred and feathered, and then ridden upona rail through the streets of Weston, while music horridand hidden accompanied the procession.

There are the facts briefly related, as they cometo us, and they can be most implicitly relied upon.They unfold to the people of the Union, and especiallyto the North, a meat alarming state of affairs. The St Louis Republican of May 26th adds the following:— The cause of this outrage to this stated: Phillipshad incurred the prejudices and displeasure of the peopleof Leavenworth City, by the part which he took inthe murder of Clark, by McCrea. He handed McCreathe pistol with which he shot Clark; and added to this,he in charged with being an native and enthusiasticagent of the Abolitionist, and swore to the protestagainst the validity of the election in the Leavenworthdistrict Some time previous a public meeting requiredPhillips to leave the Territory—but this to failed todo. Instead of leaving on the day appointed, he collectedsome forty Free Spoilers and Abolitionist, and notthem at defiance. Things continued thus until Thursday,when he was taken to Weston, and treated as already stated.' 

 There is a journal published at Washington, called theAmerican Organ, which is, as its name imports, thenational organ of the Know Nothings. The followingextracts show the way in which that journal speaks ofthe late outrages in Kansas, and the return of Gov.Reeder to his official post in that Territory:— American Organ 'Governor Reeder is to be sent back among the"border ruffians" (as they are styled by himself,)and the " ruffians" are told by the President that"not for a single moment has Gov. Reeder beendiverted from the straightforward path of duty!"—that the "ruffians" (and not Gov. Reeder) arewrong—that they have been ruffianly enough tomake a "pretext" of the conduct of the Anti-Slaverymen to do wrong themselves—that Gov.Reeder has maintained the attitude which GeneralPierce "expected" him to maintain," and thathe goes back to "discourage every movement"that will disturb the public mind. Now the President and Col. Forney both knowfull well that Gov. Reeder's re-appearance in Kansaswill be the signal for civil war. We do notbelieve that there will be one moment's peace inKansas, if he returns. Right or wrong, (and wesay not which,) a provisional government willspring up as suddenly into, existence in Kansas asit did in Paris; the people of Kansas will not allowGeneral Pierce to force Anti-Slaveryism oran Anti-Slavernor Governor upon them, and heought to know it and doubtless does know it. * * *The country will bearus witness that we have over and over again madethis declaration, that the Forney and the Piercemen were not worthy of Southern confidence, butwe did not expect so soon a formal acknowledgmentof this truth. We supposed that it would bepostponed till after the Virginia election. Theresult in Virginia, however, is now so sure to beadverse to the views of the Administration, andthey so clearly see it, that it is not deemed importantto put off what they cannot evade, and theyhave now thrown off the mask, and declared forGov. Reeder, and against the South. * * * so soon they for against * * *It is our judgment that if he (thePresident) even attempts to force Gov.

 ROCHESTER, May 24. OCHESTER Meeting in regard to Kansas Outrage in Rochester. Meeting in regard to Kansas Outrage in Rochester. —The meeting of inquiry into the recent outrages inKansas and Parkville, was held at the City Hall thisevening, but was not very largely attended, althoughthe call was signed by some three thousand names ofour citizens. Hon. W.S. Bishop, Senator from the district,presided, assisted by several Vice-Presidents. Rev. F. Starr, Jr., late of Western Missouri, and whowas obliged to leave that country by the pro-slaverymen, was present, and addressed the meeting, describingthe country, and correcting the false impressionsgiven by interested persons to prevent settlers from goinginto the new territory. He said it is the finest countryin the United States, and nearly equal for agriculturalpurposes to Western Missouri, which to the bestland in the republic He spoke very plainly and emphaticallyof Stringfellow and Atchison and their associates,and passed a high compliment upon Gov. Roeder,whom he considered to be the best man for the placethat could have been selected, but he needed a Competentforce. The Free Soilers or Free State men in Kansasare twenty-seven to one pro-slavery man, and if leftto shape the political destinies of the new State wouldnot make it a slave State. Mr. Starr is a very Intelligent and energetic young man,and has traveled a great deal in Kanakas, andknows the people well. A series of resolutions was read by Samuel D. Porter,EM., drawn up by a Committee consisting of himselfand Messrs. Lewis H. Morgan, Wm. H. Sage, Wm. C.Bios, and Professor Raymond. The resolutions declare the recent proceedings inKansas an unprecedented outrage on civil rights, andstrongly protest against them as such; call upon theGeneral Government to interfere to sustain the rightsof the settlers against the irruption of armed ruffians,and, in case volunteers are needed, pledge the citizensof Rochester to aid in restoring a republican form of governmentto that outraged country. The resolutions were unanimously adopted. Severalspeakers addressed the meeting in support of the sentimentsabove proposed. Mr. Starr proposes to give public lecture on Kansasat some future day. THE WAY IT WAS DONE. A Kanakas corm pendent ofthe Sandusky Register, among other things, says thatthough the outrage upon that Territory was plannedand conducted by Missourians, it was not entirelyachieved by them, for the Missourians of the border arenot sufficiently numerous for that purpose. They,therefore, raised a fund of $20,000, with which theyhired four hundred persona to go from Kentucky, andover four thousand from other States. Each man hadhis passage paid to Kansas and back, and received onedollar a day besides, while their leaders got from ten totwenty dollars. This army of hirelings was required tobe well armed, and was so. The violence of its memberswas but part of the service for which they werepaid. HE AY IT WAS ONE. SLAVEHOLDERS' PLANS IN KANSAS. From rumors thathave lately reached as, we are lad to infer that the Atchisonmonocarts never lose night of the spoils. They havelaid out the town of Calhoun, K.T., to which place thelegislature elected to do their bidding win adjourn andestablish the seat of government, and expend the $25000 appropriated by government to erect public buildings,when the nullifiers will sell oat and make theirfortunes before the people of Kansas can right themselvesin the promises.—Mobile Democrat.

 Ever since the decease of Daniel Webster, theState of Massachusetts has taken decisive stepsbackward, and now, as if to complete her degradation,by a single bound, she has passed an Act,over the veto of Governor Gardner, to nullify theoperation of a law of Congress, and so much of theConstitution as provides that fugitives from laborand service shall be delivered up on claim of theparty to whom such service or labor may be due.The fame of Daniel Webster reached its highestpoint from the delivery of his celebrated speech inreply to Hayne. That speech gave the death-blowto unification in the South. It was circulated overto Massachusetts, and received with just pride inevery quarter of the State. The speech raised thefame of Massachusetts to an elevation never beforeknown, except perhaps in those revolutionarytimes when an Adams, Otis, and a Hancock,set the ball of revolution to motion, and gave toPatrick Henry an occasion for the memorable sentence—'The next wind that sweeps form the North,shall bring to as the clash of resounding arms.' the South. But now, without the justification which SouthCarolina had for attempting to pass an Act of nullification,—for hers was aimed at what was unconstitutional,—Massachusetts has began which, if carried out, will reader the work of herbest sons in establishing the Constitution, and ofWebster in defending it from result of no smile.In the life-time of Webster, when great measureswere up for consideration before Congress and theUnited States, it was the custom to ask, What isthe voice of Massachusetts in regard to it! Therewere millions then, throughout the length andbreadth of the whole land, who regarded the expressionof her opinions as a declaration of theside which they were to support on that issue.But how stands the State in Abolition hands! Itassaults the independence of the Judiciary; itlowers itself by an indecent investigation in theConvent matter: and finally passes an Act in directopposition to the ground which was universallytaken when Webster made the great speech of hislife,—one of the greatest ever made as a reply,—in answer to Hayne of South Carolina. The State,instead of standing upon the pinnacle of fame asshe did then when Webster had the lead, stands asshe might be expected to stand with Sumner andWilson at the post which Webster filled. Hername is now on the lips of thousands, but withdeep mortification and shame that a State in which'the infancy of the Union was first rocked,' shouldbe,—not the last, as Webster predicted, to disturbits entrenchments,—but among the first to assail thecompact by which her own existence was secured.The question raised by this infamous proceedingis this: Shall the Constitution stand! orthe Act by which it is violated! Governor Gardner,with the true spirit of her ancient sons, vetoedthe bill, but the insane crew who hold the majorityin the Legislature which adjourned yesterday,—who sold acts of incorporation and other specialacts, and who according to Wendell Phillips,ought not to be returned for another year,—thisinsane crew, no longer fearing the great arm whichnow reposes at Marshfield, violated the Constitutionwhich they had sworn to support, and attemptedto establish Northern nullification.  filled. 

 SEVENTY PERSONS DECREED SLAVES BY A MARYLANDCOURT. Nine years ago, John Townsend, a former ofMaryland, died, leaving a will, by which he emancipatedhis slaves, seventy in number. Fearing lost hisheirs might break his will, and thus defeat his humanspurposes, he also executed, shortly before his death, adeed of emancipation, in order, if possible, to make sureof their freedom. The case has been in litigation tillrecently. First, the will was set aside by the SuperiorCourt of the State, on the alleged ground of Mr. Thompson'sinsanity, and the seventy personals declared slaves.The last suit, which has just been decided, was broughtby the friends of the slaves to that the veins of the deadof emancipation. That, too, has been decided againstthem, and they go to their chains without hope. Thusdo slaveholders shut up every possible avenue to freedom,and defeat the efforts of all, even of their ownnumber, in the behalf. Slavery they intend shall beas hopeless as the grave, and parallel in its continuancewith human existence The Northerner who advocatesfreedom is a' med fanatic' The southerner who emancipateshis slaves affords by that act safest evidencesfor the courts to decide him a lunatic-Ohio A.S.Bugle.

 The courage to do right, while all the influencesand trammels of a powerful party organization areholding out inducements to a contrary course, maybe regarded as a nobler example of true manhoodthan the most during act of bravery in battle.When we compare the courageous conduct ofJudge Loring, while acting as United States Commissionerin the case of Burns, with that of GovernorGardner in refusing to accede to the requestof so large a majority of the Legislature to removethe Commissioner from his State office of Judge ofProbate, we are at loss to decide which is mostworthy of the meed of praise. The one, amid thethreats and clamors or an infuriated populace.dured to uphold the supremacy of a national law;the other, selected by the triumphant party ofwhich that populace formed the centre and motiveprinciple as the head of that State Government,has boldly ventured to sustain the dignity andhonor of his State by disregarding the behests ofthose who would put them in jeopardy, for themomentary gratification of an excited feeling.These two cases of moral courage are unequalledby any other which occurs to us in the history ofour Government. They surpass that of JudgeChase in the trial and sentence of Callender, atRichmond; for, though somewhat similar in itscircumstances to those which surrounded JudgeLoring, and though the feeling was deep and apparentlymenacing, the danger to Judge Chase wasnot as great as his friends alleged, and the characterof the excited crowd which filled the hall atRichmond forbade the idea of personal violence;still the scene was enough to try the Judge'snerves, but he executed his sacred office with astern defiance of the popular feeling—which, youngas we were, we fully partook of—in a mannerwhich, we well remember, commanded the admirationof many who most condemned its exercise. The only instance of moral courage that weknow of, in the history of our country, which canjustly be compared with the heroism of the twoindividuals in question is also a Boston case—thatof John Adams, who, though a leading and mostardent member of the popular party, undertook todefend Captain Preston and his soldiers when indictedfor firing upon the citizens of Boston.Against the advice of his friends, and at all hazardof losing all-favor with the revolutionary party, heboldly stepped forward and gave the British soldiersthe benefit of his professional service to screenthem from the vengeance of an enraged people. Itis well known that, so far from lessening his influencewith the people whose heated passions hethus defied, the bold honesty with which he defendedwhat he believed to be an act of pare self-defensewon for him a higher degree of favor thanever. And so will it be with Governor Gardnerand Judge Loring. When the excitement of themoment shall have passed away, and calm reflectionshall have once more recovered its home inthe minds of the men of Massachusetts, thesenames will be honored by them as illustrations ofhonest devotion to truth, justice, and duty.

But we addressyou now as an outraged and subjugated people, disfranchisedand enslaved, stripped of our dearestrights, and governed by a set of masters foreign toour soil, and responsible only to their own lawlesswill. One of the States of our Union, strong in wealth,population and resources relying upon her accumulatedstrength of almost half a century, andtaking advantage of our feeble infancy as a people,has invaded our soil, seized upon our rights, subjugatedour territory and selected for us our rulers,intending also to dictate our laws, and make us theslaves of their will. This may well seem an almostincredible thing, in the Nineteenth Century,and in this Republican Union—the peculiar andboasted land of liberty and self-government—butthe evidence of it is as palpable and undeniable asthe fact is bitter and mortifying to us, and disgraceful to the Republic. This invasion of our soil and usurpation of ourrights commenced at the first moment of callingthose rights into action. The first ballot-box thatwas opened upon our virgin soil was closed to usby overpowering numbers and impending force.It became, not what Americans have been proud todesignate it, the exponent of the people's will, butwas converted into the sword of the oppressor tostrike at civil liberty. So bold and reckless wereour invaders, that they eared not to conceal theirattack. They came upon us, not in the guise of votersto steal away our franchise, but boldly and openlyto snatch it with a strong band. They came directlyfrom their own homes, and in compact andorganized bands, with arms in their bands andprovisions for the expedition, marched to our polls,and when their work was done returned whencethey came. It is unnecessary to enter into the details;it is enough to say that in three districts inwhich, by the most irrefragible evidence, therewere not one hundred and fifty voters, most ofwhom refused to participate in this mockery of theelective franchise, these invaders polled over a thousand votes. Loving our country and its institutions, we werewilling, if this was to be only a solitary instance,to suffer it in silence rather than to proclaim to theworld that even in this remote spot of our greatcountry, civil liberty was but a name. Bitter andmournful experience has taught us, however, thatthis was no isolated act—no temporary ebullition—but the commencement of a well-matured andsettled plan by a large portion of the people of oneof the States of our Union permanently to enslaveus, and constitute themselves our masters. On the 30th day of March last, we were againinvited to the ballot-box, under the law which we,in common with our fellow-citizens of the States,bad through your body enacted. Our vigilant andfaithful Chief Magistrate had surrounded it withall the guards and precautions with which his authorityinvested him, and we were prepared to exercisethe dearest and most cherished privileges ofAmerican citizens with a full sense of the vital andinteresting importance of this peculiar occasion. The occasion came, and with it came our invadingand self-constituted masters in thousands, andwith all the paraphernalia of war. They came,organized in bands, with officers, and arms, andtents, and provisions, and munitions of war, asthough they were marching upon a foreign  insteadof their own unoffending fellow-citizens.Upon the principal road leading into our territory,and passing several important polls, they numberednot less than twelve hundred men, and one campalone contained not less than six hundred.  They arrived at their several destinations thenight before the elections, and having pitched theircamps and placed their sentries waited for the comingday. Baggage-wagons were there with armsand ammunitions enough for a protracted fight, andamong them, two brace field-pieces ready charged.They came with drums beating and flags flying.and their leaders were of the most prominent andconspicuous men of their respective States. In themorning they surrounded the polls armed withguns, bowie-knives and revolvers, and declaredtheir determination to vote at all hazards, and inspite of all consequences. If the Judges could be made to subserve theirpurposes and receive their votes, and if no obstaclewas cast in their way, the leaders exerted themselvesto preserve peace and order in the conductof the election, but at the same time did not hesitateto declare that if not allowed to vote, theywould pressed to say extremity in the destructionof property and life. If control of the polls couldnot be had otherwise, the Judges were by intimidation,and if necessary by violence, prevented fromperforming their duty; or, if unyielding in this respect,were driven from their post and the vacancyfilled, in form, by the persons on the ground; andwhenever by any means they had obtained the controlof the Board, the foreign vote was previouslypassed in without discrimination or reserve,or the slightest care to annual its nefarious illegality. At due of these polls, two of the Judges having up in the face of this armed and declared they would do their duty, one partiesof the mob  to another practiced to  injudges,  shows  with the proclaimedpurposes  who wouldallow himself to be sworn. Voters were dragged the window  they would not showtheir  with the affection of the ,and the invaders declared openly at the polls thatthey would cut the throats of the Judges if theydid not receive their votes without requiring anoath as to their residence.              The room was finally forced, and the Judges surroundedby an armed and excited crowd were offeredthe alternatives of resignation or death, and fiveminutes were allowed for their decision. The ballot-boxwas seized, and amid shouts of Hurrahfor Missouri,' was carried into the mob. The twomenaced Judges then left the ground, together withall the resident citizens except a few who acted inthe outrage, because the result expected from itconformed to their views, and because it enabledthe few to rule the many. When an excess of theforeign force was found to be had at one poll, detachmentswere sent to others where it was supposedthey might be needed. At the polls adjoining the one above alluded to,one of the Judges, a minister of the Gospel, whorefused to accede to the demands of a similar mobof some four hundred armed and organized men,was driven by violence from his post, and the'vacancy' filled by themselves. Threats and violentdemonstrations were rife and another clergyman,for the expression of his opinion, was assaultedand beaten. The inhabitants of the district,powerless to resist the abundant supply of armsand ammunition, the organized preparation andthe overwhelming numbers of these foreigners, leftthe polls without voting. In the Lawrence District, where was the largestcamp of these invaders, speeches were made tothem, by leading residents of Missouri, in which itwas said that they would carry their purposes, ifneed be, at the point of the bayonet and the bowieknife,and one voter war fired at as he was drivenfrom the election ground. Finding they had agreater force than was necessary for that poll, sometwo hundred men were drafted from their number,and sent off under their proper officers to anotherdistrict, after which they still polled from thiscamp over seven hundred votes. In the Fourth and Seventh Districts, along theSanta Fe road, similar scenes were enacted. Theinvaders came together, in one armed and organizedbody, with trains of fifty wagons, besideshorsemen, and the night before election pitchedtheir camp in the vicinity of the polls, and havingappointed their own Judges in place of thosewho, from intimidation or otherwise, failed to attend,they voted without any proof of residence.In these two election districts, where the censusShows one hundred voters there were polled threehundred and fourteen votes, and last fall, sevenhundred and sixty-five votes, although a large portionof the actual residents did not vote upon eitheroccasion. In the Sixteenth Election District,hundreds of men came together as in other cases,crossing the river from Missouri the day beforeelection and encamping together, armed and provisioned,made the fiercest threats against the livesof the Judges, and during the night called severaltimes at the house of one of them for the purposeof intimidating him, declaring, in the presence ofhis wife, that a rope had been prepared to hanghim; and although we are not prepared to say thatthere threats would have been carried out, yet theyserved to produce his resignation, and give theseinvaders, in the substitution, control of the polls;and on the morning of the election, a steamboastbrought from the town of Weston, Missouri, toLeavenworth, an accession to their numbers ofseveral hundred more, who returned in the sameboat, after depositing their votes. There wereover nine hundred and fifty votes polled besidefrom one hundred to one hundred and fifty actualresidents who were deterred or discouraged fromvoting, while the census returns show but threehundred and eighty-five votes in the district amonth later. Not less than six hundred voteswere here given by the non-residents of the Territory,who voted without being sworn as to theirqualifications and immediately after the electionreturned to Missouri—some of them being the incumbentsof important public offices there. Indeed,so well was the character of this foreignvote understood, that the Judges struck out of theprescribed form of return the words 'by lawfulresident voters.' We might continue the list of these sickeningdetails until the blood of every freeman would boilwith indignation, but it is useless. One more instancealone we will refer to. In the EighteenthElection District, where the population was and no great number of foreign votes was nto overpower it, a detachment from Missouri fromsixty to one hundred strong, passed in with a trainof wagons, arms and ammunition, making theircamp, the night before the election, near Moorestown,the place of the polls, without even a ptof residence, and returning immediately toMissouri after their work was done, their leaderand captain being a distinguished citizen of Missouri,but late the presiding officer of the Senate ofthe United States and who had a bowie-knifeand revolver bolted around him, apparently readyto abed the blood of any man who refused to beenslaved. All these facts we are prepared to establish,if necessary, by proof that would be consideredcompetent in a court of justice.   arms  From a careful examination of the returns, weare satisfied that over three thousand votes werethus cast by the citizens and residents of the States,and that a very large portion of the residents weredeterred and discouraged from going to the polls.If this condition of things be allowed to prevail,We are reduced to the state of a vassal provi,And are governed by the State of Missouri.  It would be mere affectation in us to attempt todisguise the fast, that the question of making Kansasa free or slave State is at the bottom of thismovement, and that the men who thus invade oursoil and rob us of our liberties are from the pro-slaverymen of Missouri, who are unwilling to submitthe question to the people of the Territory, andabide the compact between the North and South,which the Kansas Nebraska bill contains. The compact we want carried out, and by thattest we want the question settled if it can be; butthere are few things that we would not preferto the domination of irresponsible invaders fromMissouri. That enactment is not only a law whichStates and individuals are bound to obey, but it isa compact between the North and the South—a solemncovenant between the sovereign States of ourUnion, which none violate without becomingrecreant to the principles of honor and justice—without the betrayal of confidence renamed—withoutthe breaking of plighted faith as in an individualwould lead him to the earth with s andcontempt, and drive him from the society of honestmen. The bill which Northern  hashedwith Northern v had rights is made by men who invade will thevery instrument for privileges, and  them what with  formuch.         That bill, in for them—serfdom for us. The doctrine of self-governmentis to be trampled under foot here, ofall other places in the world, on the very spotwhich had been hallowed and consecrated to itsmost signal vindication. The altars which hadbeen reared to it on this chosen ground, and aroundwhich at least the democracy of the whole Unionhad sworn allegiance, and to which we had comeas pilgrim worshippers in the wilderness, are to beruthlessly demolished. The compact is to be baselybroken, and the ballot of the freeman (in effect)torn from our hands almost before the ink of thecovenant is dry. Not only, too, is the principle ofpopular sovereignty to be blotted out, but, morethan this, even the object of the contest is todisappear. The question of negro slavery is tosink into insignificance, and the great portentousissue is to loom up in its stead whether or not weshall be the slaves, and fanatics who disgrace thehonorable and chivalric men of the South shall beour masters, to rule us at their pleasure.  With a feeble and scattered community, juststruggling into existence, without organization andalmost without shelter, we are powerless to resistan old, strong, and populous State, full of men andarms and resources, and we therefore appeal toyou and through you to the people of the States.Remedy here we have none. Our Executive has, with manly determinationand persistent fidelity, stood by his people, and endeavoredto carry out the principles of popular sovereignty,and secure us the privilege of managingour own affairs and governing ourselves, until hisreputation has been assailed and his life openlythreatened with a bitterness almost unparalleled;and, although as chief magistrate he is all wecould desire, and has fearlessly pursued the pathof duty amid a storm of menace and detraction underwhich many men would have quailed, yet heis powerless-like ourselves. We make now this last appeal, not to the North,not to the South, not to any political party; butto the Representatives of the whole Union. Webeg that no man will sport with our condition byendeavoring to make political capital, or build upparty at the expense of our civil and political existence.We want the men of the North and themen of the South to protect us. Through yourselves,their Representatives, we appeal to theirhonor—to their justice—to their patriotism—totheir sympathies, not for favors, but for rights—notfor trivial rights, but for the dearest rightsguaranteed to us by the Declaration of Independence—by the Constitution of the Union—by thelaw of our organization—by the solemn compact ofthe States, and which you pledged to us as thecondition of our coming here. Communities are not to blame for the conduct oftheir fanatics, unless they sanction them. Wecannot believe that the States of the South willsanction the outraged that have been perpetratedupon us, or will allow them to be continued. Andalthough we might reason the matter as a questionof policy, and show that it is contrary to thelaws of nature and society, and opposed to human experience that good can come from suchevil; although we might prove that it is 'sowingthe wind, and reaping the whirlwind,' and thatthe reaction will be fearful, yet we feel that this isunnecessary; that it is enough to appeal to theirhonor and their sense of justice, and to rely upontheir plighted faith.  Inside our bounds, we shall have no serioustroubles. Northern and Southern men mingle togetherin harmony and good feeling, and in mutualdependence and assistance in the hardships andprivations of a pioneer life. As we learn to understandeach other, friendships are engenderedand prejudices melt away, so that we shall be ableto meet all questions that may arise in a spirit ofjustice and friendly feeling, which will secure therights of all, and cheerful acquiescence in the decisionof the majority. From foreign oppression,however, we ask for relief of that power whichpassed the Kansas bill, and pledged to us its benefitsif we would come here. We have a right toask and do ask its enforcement. It remains foryour honorable bodies to decide whether you willkeep the compact between you and us which existsby that bill and our emigration; whether you willvindicate the sacred doctrines of the Government,or whether you will leave us in a state of vassalageand oppression. We cannot and do not doubt thatyou will in some way give us justice and protection.

 PARKVILLE, Mo., April 23d, 1855. ARKVILLE To THE PUBLICWhen our printing-office was destroyed, I wasabsent in Kansas Territory, and returned forth withon receiving information of it. I am filled with thedeepest concern for the events that have transpiredand the passions that hear away—premeditated asthey have been by a large and powerful secret association.I am happy to know that the citizens ofParkville and vicinity took no part in it; andWhy my life and property would be destroyed byany portion of this community, I cannot tell. Thecharge of abolitionism is false: I have never harboredthought nor meditated an action detrimentalthe honor, the interests, or institutionsof Missouri; but have labored unceasingly to promoteher prosperity. It is true, I have not believedthe honor and interests of Missouri to be inthat course of policy method out by come politicians.Duty has compelled me to cross theirpath, which has brought on my devoted head theBitterest persecution. UBLIC Our paper can be read. It will speak for itself.It does not claim perfection. The leadingObjects have been to promote the principles oftemperance, morality and —to take a conservativepolitical stand, and by moderating theextremes, and by softening sectional , topromote the general good of the country, and theprosperity of the American Union.   I love the South, and have spent the bapt energiesof my life to advance her interests and herglory. The battle-fields of Texas are eternal evidencesof the fast, for it was these individualenterprise gathered  the Houston,and by incredible hardships and almost man exercise, the independence of that  countrytry was achieved—now one of the in the constellation of States. And I fellow-citizens to attest the fast, that Wile I haveresided in Missouri, I have labored to promote her interests.       I love the North,  Never, while he lastsshall I forget the  kills of Vermont, whererests the grave of my mother, not the  ofthe men of 76; nor the virtue and energies ofthe men who have made there  a bosom-light—the wonder and  of the world;and I shall over look upon their glory as thecommon incidence of every  slaves.       With regard to having this commonly, I wouldas cheerfully, so  as I could depute of my have, were I  what a fosher  but to leave the gaveof my wife, the house I have  years to emboilish and improve, and many interest, interwovenwith the growth and prosperity of the country,and flee for no offence like a base culprit—I cannot!I would rather prefer death at my ownhome amid the flowers and trees planted and consecratedby affection, and upon the soil of thecountry I have toiled to build up!         Our press has been thrown into the Missouririver. I may be buried there too. An humbleindividual is in the power of hundreds of armedmen; but his death will not destroy the freedomof the AMERICAN PRESS! Independence of thoughtand action is inherent in the bosom of every freeman,and it will gush up like a perpetual fountainfor ever! God has impressed on his universethe principles of truth and justice, and they mustprevail. MERICAN RESS If there is no security in the land or Washington;if an American homo affords no protection;if the time has arrived when this Union must hedissolved, and all its kindred ties and mighty interestsbroken and destroyed, and our land drenchedwith fraternal blood; then let me be buried beneaththe turbid water, of the Missouri, ratherthan live to behold such a scene! God save ourcountry! GEO.S. PARK. MR. GEORGE S. PARK.—This gentleman, whoseconnection with the office of the Parkville Luminaryhas given him some notoriety, called to see usyesterday. The press upon which that paper wasissued was destroyed by citizen, of Platte county,and Mr. Park was notified to leave within a giventime. Not wishing to incur the resentment of thepeople who had thus treated him, and who, he says.were not citizens of Parkville, he has left that sectionof the country, and will probably take of hisresidence, for the time, on a farm he owns in Illinois. R. EORGE ARK. Luminary Mr. Park established the Luminary at Parkvillewithout any very strong political affinities, but ina very little time he was pushed into the supportof Benton and Bentonism, and this, we apprehend,may be regarded as the beginning of his troubles.In supporting Benton in his paper, the people wereled to suspect that he was not 'sound on the goosequestion,' but his antecedents are all against thissupposition. He is the owner of slaves—has grownup in Missouri, and acquired wealth, and we shouldnot suppose from his appearance and character thathe would make himself obnoxious to any class ofpeople.—St. Louis Intelligencer. Luminary St. Louis Intelligencer. The Parkville Luminary newspaper office wasmobbed and the press thrown into the Missouririver, because its editors bad published the followingmoderate rebuke of the outraged committed inKansas by citizens of Missouri. Read, and seehow much abolitionism there is in it: Luminary 'We have occupied conservative and nationalground, promptly opposing the measures and menwho have brought on this crisis. Will the Presidentmeet it' Surely he cannot longer followcounsels from Abolitionists and Nullifiers Thecountry demands that sound, firm, energetic menhave the direction of public affairs, who will impressand enforce justice and law. There is virtuallyno law in Kansas, and no security for lawand property, save in the sense of honor and justicecherished by every true pioneer. This MAYsave the country from the bloodshed, but the Governmentis held tip to ridicule and contempt, andits authority disregarded; judges of elections havebeen displaced and others appointed—the pollshave in some instances been guarded with pistolsand bowie knives—and some of those elected aregoing to the Governor swearing that if he does notgive a certificate of election immediately, they willcut his throat from ear to ear. Is the flag of ourcountry to be no longer a protection?—or are individualsor companies of men to declare WE WILL!and it must be so without regard to law! Is thiswhat the authors of the Kansas-Nebraska billmeant by popular sovereignty?

 A letter from Kansas, which we find in the MissouriDemocrat, gives the following account of therecent killing of Malcolm Clark. It will be seenthat it differs essentially from the statements concerningthe same affair hitherto furnished by thenigger-driving journals of that quarter: Democrat A squatter meeting was held at LeavenworthCity to take into consideration the propriety ofgiving further time to claimants to come and liveupon their claims. Mr. McCrea, a lawyer of thatplace, opposed the extension of time. Mr. MalcolmClark replied to Mr. McCrea, and said that McCreawas a d—d rascal, anyway. McCrea went off andgot a pistol. When he returned, a few more wordspassed, and Clark struck him: McCrea drew hispistol; Clark picked up a board; McCrea ran, andClark pursued him. In the chase, Clark droppedhis board, when McCrea turned, and holding hispistol within a foot of Clark's breast, fired, andshot him through the heart The crowd, greatlyincensed, rushed upon McCrea with slicks andatones, and began to beat him terribly—knockingout his front teeth, &C. He ran to the river, andjumped in, but it happened to be a miry spot, andhe stuck up to his arms in mud. He was draggedout, and a vote was taken whether he should behanged on the spot, or sent to Fort Leavenworthfor trial. It was decided to send him to the Fort.He was placed in a carriage for that purpose. Thecrowd by this time had greatly increased, and itwas proposed to reconsider the vote, which wasdone. It was then, by a large majority, votedthat he should hang. A rope was immediatelysent for, but before it was brought, a gentlemanjumped into the carriage beside McCrea, drew arevolver upon the driver, and told him to drive toFort Leavenworth as fast as possible, or he wouldblow his brains out; and said to the crowd, thatif they hung McCrea, they would have to hang himalso. I have not yet been able to learn the name of thisgentleman, but I hear he is from Virginia or Kentucky.No matter whence he came, he is a boldand generous fellow. On the next day, viz., on the first day of thismonth—day before yesterday—the corpse of Clarkwas taken to Weston, Missouri, of which place hehad been a citizen before his recent residence atLeavenworth City. The people there gathered overit and made violent speeches and passed strong resolutions,one of which was that they would proceedto Fort Leavenworth and take McCrea and hanghim. Friday, the 4th inst., was fixed upon as theday of his execution. Of course, be will be protectedby the officers of the Fort. Clark was about thirty-eight or forty years ofage, very athletic, bold and self-confident, and wasa strong pro-slavery man. McCrea is an Abolitionist.He was saved by a pro-slavery man.

 Mrs. Stowe Burnt in Effigy and her Sinter Intuited—A Specimen of the Manliness of Virginian Collegians.—Within the past few days, the Universityof Virginia has been the scene of incidents hardlycreditable to the chivalry of the Old Dominion.Miss Beecher, an able and accomplished lady, thesister of Rev.

 GOVERNOR GARDNER'S REFUSAL to remove JudgeLoring astonished the majority of the Legislature,and disappointed a majority of the people of theState: but it rejoiced the 'Southern Know Nothingsand National Whigs.' A letter from Washingtonsays so. It says, also, that if GovernorGardner had removed Judge Loring, it would havegreatly prejudiced the interests of the Know Nothingparty in the Southern States—especially Virginia.The Governor's refusal, however, has puteverything into right shape again, He has, it tosaid, convinced the people of Virginia, that MassachusettsKnow Nothingism is not Anti-Slaveryism indisguise. The Virginians will, therefore, electMr. Flournoy to be the next Governor of that State.This is a somewhat singular view of the influenceof Governor Gardner's veto. He has taken a positionalmost purely isolated and independent, inrelation to the removal of Judge Loring. He hasrefused to listen to the address of the Legislature,supported by the almost universal sentiment of thepeople; and yet this action, which detaches himfrom the confidence and support of his own fellow-citizensof Massachusetts, attaches him to the proslaverycitizens of Virginia! Did Governor Gardnerrefuse to accede to the desire of Massachusetts,that he might obtain influence in the South!—There have been as unlikely things. He is a gentlemanof great facility in turning, and, lookingtowards 1856 and the possibilities of the nationalelection, may have shaped his veto accordingly.One thing in undoubtedly certain, and that is, thathe has given comfort and encouragement to thosemen who wish to spread slavery over Kansas andNebraska, and he has insulted the freemen of thecommunity in which he lives.— Worcester Spy. OVERNOR ARDNER'S EFUSAL Worcester Spy. We repeat, 'the strong vote of both Houses of 1the Massachusetts Legislature to remove JudgeLoring for official incompetence, is a striking evidenceof the strength of justice in the hearts of the people.'In the name of the offended sovereignty ofMassachusetts, let him be removed. In the nameof the widow and the fatherless, who should findin a Judge of Probate a man having at least thecommon measure of intelligence, and the commoninstincts of humanity, let him be removed. In thename of Humanity, which he has trampled underfoot, let him be removed. In the name of the Judiciary,which he has brought into contempt, lethim be removed. In the name of the Eternal Justice,outraged by his mockery of its sacred dignity,let him be removed.

The Senate of Massachusettshas concurred with the action of the House, in itsvote removing Mr. Loring from his office of ProbateJudge. This is a most righteous act, and onein which all right-minded persons will rejoice. Itrises far above a mere question of personal hostilityto Judge Loring. It is not the man, as an individual,that Massachusetts has branded, but the manus an official slave-catcher. The old Commonwealthhas set her mark upon the brow of her unnaturalson, who so far forgot the lessons of his Puritanmother, as to aid in the return of a human beingto the oppression from which he had fled. Thisact of Massachusetts is worthy the descendants ofthe Mayflower. It is some vindication from thedisgrace inflicted upon the State by the authoritiesof Boston, and the minions of the Federal power,in the extradition of Bofns. The man who couldaid in any way in such a transaction, is manifestlyunfit to decide questions of right between manand man. His moral perceptions are too obtuse toenable him to discern the right, or his conscienceis too seared to induce him to regulate his officialconduct by the law of eternal rectitude. UDGE ORING. This act is ominous. The brand of Cain is beingburned into the brows of the recreant Northerners,who level themselves to enforce the infamousfugitive act. They are marked men.

GARDNER AND THE CONSERVATIVE PRESS.—The National Intelligencer and the Southern Whigand Know Nothing Press seem to have penetratedthe character of Governor Gardner. Their praiseof his marvellous independence and ability is mostextravagant. Daniel Webster himself hardly everreceived more high-flown compliments. Nothingso manly, so loyal, so heroic, so grand, has beendone since the time old John Adams defended, ascounsel, the British soldiers.

National Era. ANOTHER VETO. On Monday forenoon, GovernorGardner returned the Personal Liberty Bill to theSenate without his signature. We had no ideathat Gardner would sign this bill. Such an actwould have committed him to the anti-slavery party,and we do not believe that he ever had any ideaof being so committed. It is true, he appeared atan anti-slavery meeting in Boston, with SenatorWilson and Hon. Anson Burlingame, but that appearance.like his celebrated letter, was only forBuncombe. When he was called upon to act, inthe case of Loring and in the present case, he tookshelter behind the subterfuge of patriotism, andrefused either to relieve the judiciary of Massachusettsof a humiliating disgrace, or to throw aroundthe poor, colored citizen of this Commonwealth,the protection of habeas corpus and trial by jury.Gardner has been urged, by the hunker presses, toveto this bill, and he has done it. Southern KnowNothings have urged him to veto it, and thus influencethe Virginia election, and he has done it.The Legislature and people of Massachusetts desiredhim to approve it, and he has not done it. IsGovernor Gardner less a Governor of Massachusettsthan a subject of Virginia? The Senate, however,passed the bill over the veto by a vote of 32 to 3,and the House by a vote of 229 to 76, so that thebill is a law, Gov. Gardner to the contrary notwith-standing.— Worcester Spy.

Dedham Gazette. The Hiss revelations wore unfortunate for thecredit of the Commonwealth, but the exposure ofhis acts indicated a right spirit in the minds of themembers. Doubtless the House, as the New YorkTribune remarks, 'so far as personal character isconcerned, is as honest and respectable a body asever sat in Massachusetts.' Upon questions involvingmoral elements, their action was uniformlyhigh-toned and courageous. The anti-slavery elementhas been predominant in both branches, asindicated in the action upon Judge Loring and thePersonal Liberty Bill. Even Boston sent fifteen ortwenty anti-slavery men in her delegation of fortyfourrepresentatives.

 I saw in the visions of nightAn African village on fire!The flames rolled along in their might,And the shrieks of the victims rose higher and higher,As of infant, and parent, and grey-beaded sire.     The man-stealers sprang on their prey!And hundreds were slain or subdued;Some perished in utter dismay,And others were slain while for mercy they sued;And the soil they had tilled with their blood was imbrued.     One sight I shall never forget,Till the sunbeam of life is denied,And the star of my memory shall set:A bridegroom, self-slaughtered, enclasping his bride,Who lay murdered, and mangled, and scorched by his side.     The captives in fetters were bound,Fear ran through their tremulous frames,And they sobbed as they gazed round and round,For where children that day had been playing their games.    There were carcasses, captives, and smoldering flames. The vision fled slowly away,And another appeared in its place:I looked on a beautiful bay,And ships in tranquility slept on its face:They were slavers!—the pest of the African race.     On the shore was a horrible mart,Where man was the merchandise sold,Where the beet blood that boils through the heartWas bartered as though it were stolid and coldAs the storm-beaten rock, or the slave-dealer's gold!     Sweet babes from their mothers were torn—Wives were rent from their husbands away—Fond brothers asunder were borne—And lovers were parted and sold fur astray,To clasp hands never more till the great Judgment-day.     I heard them in anguish complain.For life without love is but dross;But they pleaded for mercy in vain,For the demons who swore by the creed of the Crows,Turned their faces away with an insolent toss.     I gazed on the hot iron brand,As it hissed on each ebony skin;I saw the slaves borne from the landTo a slave-ship, and packed in a large loathsome bin,Where the stench seemed to quench the dull light thatstole in.      The vision fled slowly away,And another appeared in its place:Far around flashed the bright ocean spray,And a ship sped along in her beauty and grace,Bounding o'er the wild waves with the swift swallow'space.      But pestilence, madness and deathRaged and raved in her dark crowded hold,And the slaves, as they drew their last breath,Unconfined, unwept, ere their limbs were yet cold,O'er the tall vessel's side were remorselessly rolled!     Swift, swift o'er the billowy main,Flew onward that death-stricken bark,And following as swift in her trainSwam many a monstrous and ravenous shark,Gorging freely their fill of the carcasses dark.     As I gazed, the great deep was unsealed;I looked down on the broad ocean's bed.  And a valley of bones was revealed,Which shall yet be an army with banners outspread,When the last trumpet sounds which shall waken thedead!    The vision fled slowly away,And another appeared in its place:Before me a fair vision lay,Where mountains rose high, like a huge giant race,With sweet flowery fields lying calm at their base.     That land was the land of the slave!The scene of his closing career!Where the generous, the fond, and the brave,Toiled on in their manacles, year after year,Paid with stripes for their labor—their solace, a jeer.     I saw them worn out with their toil,Urged on by the slave-driver's whip;I saw the lash cruelly coilRound their scar-covered backs, till the warm bloodwould drip,While a groan faintly fell from the eloquent lip!      Enslaved both in body and mind,The victims of grief and despair,They seemed to their fortune resigned,With no will of their own, for the future no care,Like the dumb beasts of burden, whose lot is—to bear.     I beheld a poor African chief,Whose name was once honored afar,Yet meekly he bore with his grief,And sang to himself, 'Calabar! Calabar!'Me could die in sweet peace could me see Calabar!     The vision fled slowly away,And another appeared in its place:I witnessed the great Judgment-day!And the branded, down-trodden, enlaved negro race,With their tyrants and task-masters stood face to face!     Then spake ONE from the cloud which he trod—IF MAN HAS NO MERCY ON MAN,HOW CAN MAN HOPE FOR MERCY FROM GOD?'And a cry of despair through the multitude ran,'There is no hope for men who have trafficked in man!' NE  F MAN HAS NO MERCY ON MAN  OW CAN MAN HOPE FOR MERCY FROM GOD?   

 We answer—No. Not while the existing Unionstands. Its fate is settled. We shall briefly state someof the reasons which force us to this sad conclusion. 1. The South is united in the determination to makeKansas a slave State—ultimately, by division, half adozen slave States, if necessary. She has never yetbeen foiled in her purpose thus concentrated and expressed;and she has too much at stake to allow freespeech, a free press, and free labor, to hold the masteryin that vast Territory. 2. Eastern emigration will avail nothing to keep slaveryout of Kansas. Though we have hitherto beencareful to say nothing to discourage it, we have neverhad any faith in it as a breakwater against the inundationof the dark waters of oppression. Hardly a singleabolitionist can be found among all who have emigratedto that country. Undoubtedly, the mass of emigrantsare in favor of making Kansas a free Stats as amatter of sound policy, and would do so if they werenot under the dominion of Missouri ruffianism, or ifthey could rely upon the sympathy and aid of thegeneral government in this terrible crisis; but theyhave not gone to Kansas to be martyrs in the causeof the enslaved negro, nor to sacrifice their chance for ahomestead on the altar of principle, but to find a comfortablehome for themselves and their children. Beforethey emigrated, they gave little or no countenanceto the anti-slavery cause at home; they partook of thegeneral indifference or hostility to the labors of radicalabolitionism; at least, they could only dream of making'freedom national, and slavery sectional,' afterthe manner of 'the fathers'; and they were poisonedmore or less with the virus of colorphobia. If theyhad no pluck here, what could rationally be expected ofthem in the immediate presence of the demoniacal spiritof slavery? They represent the average sentiment ofthe North on this subject—nothing more; and that isstill subservient to the will of the South. They darenot defend their own rights; how then can they defendthe rights of the enslaved? To place any relianceupon their anti-slavery zeal or courage is to lean upona broken staff. We do not say this reproachfully, butbecause it is the truth; and to show why we have nohope, and see no ray of light, in that quarter. 3. The omnipotent power of the general governmentwill cooperate with the Vandals of Missouri to 'crushout' what little anti-slavery feeling may exist in Kansas,and to sustain their lawless proceedings in that Territory.This will prove decisive in the struggle. 4. On the subject of slavery, there it no principle inthe Kansas papers ostensibly desirous of making it afree State. Here, for instance, is before us 'THE HERALDOF FREEDOM,' of May 12th, published at Lawrence,which claims to be, and we believe is, the ascot outspokenjournal in Kansas, in regard to the rights of thebone fine settlers. What does its editor say? Listen!— 'While publishing a paper in Kansas, we feelthat it b not our province (!) to discuss the subject offreedom or slavery in the States'! Is not this themost heartless inhumanity, the most arrant moral cowardice,the clearest demonstration of unsoundness ofmind? Again he says:— HE ERALDOF REEDOM bone fine settlers. in the States'! 'We are not what is known in the South as an 'Abolitionist.'but are in favor of the emancipation of theslave through the apprenticeship system, as was donein Pennsylvania and most of the Northern States. Immediateand unconditional emancipation, we believe,would be destructive to the best interests of all concerned.THE MASTSER WOULD BE DESTROYED, (!!) and theslave turned loose upon the world, ignorant, and whollyunqualified for the responsible duties of life. Whenemancipation does take place, it should be gradual inits operation, and the negro should be educated and fittedto sustain his new relationship to society.' apprenticeship Immediateand unconditional emancipation, we believe,would be destructive to the best interests of all concerned. HE MASTSER WOULD BE DESTROYED turned loose gradual educated Now this is as rank pro-slavery reading as any thingto be found in the Richmond Examiner or the CharlestonMercury. To show its folly, its wickedness, its insanity,has been the one great effort of the abolitionistsfor the last quarter of a century. It surrenders thewhole ground to the enemies of impartial liberty, andmakes the present enslavement of those in headagea meritorious act—for 'immediate and unconditionalemancipation would be destructive to the best interestsof all concurred'!! And this is the paper which hasmade, and is making, its apposes to the anti-slaverymen and women of Massachusetts to swell its subscriptionlist, as tree to the cause of freedom! And theyhave done so. When such is the compromising spiritof left to believe that the defiant and de spirit ofslavery will be  is the struggle? Examiner Mercury.   These are some of the  why we believe Kansaswill inevitably be a slave States.  

 How oft has disappointment marredSome cherished plan of mine,And bidden winter clouds appearWhere summer's sun should shine!    Yet often as they darker grew,I 've seen some wondrous penUpon the very blackest writeThe sentence—'Try again.'    How often in the stilly hourOf night, the heavy sighIn sympathy has strove to meetThe tear-drop in my eye;And then like angels whisperingTheir messages to men,I've heard a quiet breathing ofThe sentence—'Try again.'        How often, as I've walked amidstLife's ever busy tide,And jostled with its faver'd onesOn each and every side;When my misfortunes seamed to beO'erwhelming, even thanHas some good spirit breathed to meThe sentence—'Try again!        My guardian angel it mast be,Or else the weight of careHad sunk me in the very depthsOf sorrow and despair:    But, oh! my heart much lighter seems,And hops shines brighter, whenI hear that spirit softly breathsThe sentence—'Try again.    

 Since the adoption of the Constitution of Massachusetts,there has never been a Legislative so thoroughlydemocratic, in the matter of poplar representation—is the absence of professional and scholastic exclusiveness—in the presence of a fair proportion of mechanics,farmers, and the laboring population generally—asthe one which has just adjourned. The aristocraticelement was completely exercised out of it; the spiritof cottonocracy was powerless in it; it was emphaticallyof THE PEOPLE, without pretense, unsophisticated,inexperienced in regard to the forms of legislation, butembodying an unusual amount of moral worth andhonesty of purpose, controlled by the progressive spiritof the age, self-guided to the prostration of all ambitiousleadership, and indicating no lake of speaking orworking talent. Thought nominally a 'Know Nothing'body, its regard for the cause of human freedom, asagainst the aggressions of the Slave Power, was clearlyparamount to all other considerations. It turned adeaf our to all the evil prognostications of Hunkeriem,trampled in the dust the temptations of pro-slaveryNationalism, foiled allies the wealth and the craft ofState street, and used with great moderation the powercommitted to its hands, with reference to foreign emigrantsto these shores. This is simple historical justice, aside from all considerationsof the 'Know Nothing' movement generally,against which we have earnestly protested from thebeginning, and which, organized into one great nationalparty, we have no doubt will be as servile to thebehests of the Slave Power as ever the Democratic partyhas been—and even more malignant, if possible. The manner in which the Legislature was assailed,from the first to the last day of its proceedings, withoutmitigation or conation, by the Whig journals of Bostonin particular, and of the Commonwealth, in general,has revealed a wide-spread Toryism, identical in spiritand purpose with that which sought to crush the Revolutionarystraggle for American independence; whichridiculed and denounced suck plain men as Sam Adams,John Adams and Paul Revere, and maintainedthat the people were too vulgar sad too ignorant totake upon themselves the responsibilities of government;which regarded a favored few as the Heavenappointed rulers of the many; which saw in John Hancocka vile traitor, and in Gov. Hutchinson a paragonof loyalty to duty; which perversely cried up 'lawand order,' and cried down freedom of speech and theright to protest against parliamentary oppression;which taught, with mock religious zeal and devotion,that 'the powers that be are ordained of God,' eventhe powers of King George the Third, and his primeminister Lord North—to resist which was to inour theperils of damnation; which opposed every effort to removeold abuses, monstrous usurpations, insupportableburdens unjustly imposed upon the body politic; whichbranded reform as fanaticism, opposition to tyrannicallaws as treason, free inquiry as infidelity, and non-conformityas wicked insubordination; which saw nothingstable except in despotism, nothing praiseworthyexcept in unquestioning obedience, nothing virtuousexcept in the past, nothing desirable except intellectual,moral and religious stagnation;—a spirit skin tothat which stoned the prophets, which crucified Jesusas one having a devil, which persecuted unto death theapostles as 'pestilent and seditious fellows, the filth ofthe earth, and the offscouring of all things'; and whichin all ages has been at war with every new movementto put down established wrong, and to build up downtroddenright. The malignity of the Boston press, with scarcely anexception, towards the Legislature, has been of the intensestkind; not because of its 'Know Nothing' complexion,but on account of its overmastering love offreedom—its determination to secure to every man inMassachusetts, claimed as a slave, all the protectionwhich the State has a right to give—its regard for thepublic peace, prosperity, happiness and virtue, in thepassage of the Maine Law—and especially, because itwas so largely composed of men in the ordinary walksof life, unsophisticated farmers, industrious mechanics,hard-handed artizans, who are regarded by thesemouthpieces of a soulless aristocracy as fit only to beruled by 'gentlemen of eminent gravity' and menof property and standing,' but never to manage theaffairs of the Commonwealth. It is the Toryism of 1775in the guise of Conservatism—contempt for the masses,and a selfish regard for class legislation. Consult thefiles of the Advertiser, the Courier, the Post, the Journaland the Traveller, (to say nothing of the Herald,Mail, and Times, because too low to challenge criticism,)—for no city in the land is cursed with a morehunkerish, mean, cowardly, depraved and hypocriticalpress than Boston,—and see how constantly the actionof the Legislature has been jeered at, ridiculed, misrepresented,caricatured, anathematized, to the totaldisregard of all that belongs to fairness, decency, andhonorable dealing, no matter what may have been thequestion under consideration, and wholly irrespectiveof its merits. Such conduct is nothing better than unmitigatedscoundrelism. The conductors of the papersalluded to habitually reveal themselves as withoutprinciple or self-respect, traitors to the cause of liberty,more dangerous to the Commonwealth than all thepickpockets and burglars therein. They systematicallyand designedly poison the life-blood of the community.There is not a particle of manhood among themall They are the sycophants of Mammon—the spanielsof Cottonocracy—the servile tools of the SlavePower. In whatever else they may differ, they are alwaysagreed in resisting human advancement, the overthrowof long-established wrong, unpopular truth, theclaims of outraged humanity. They are morally incapableof uttering an independent thought or a noblesentiment In short—THEY ARE TORIES. Advertiser Courier Post Journal Traveller Herald,Mail Times In consequence of the illegal, precipitate and mercilessconduct of Judge Loring in the case of AnthonyBurns,—a Probate Judge eager to play the part of atwo-lagged bloodhound as Slavs Commissioner undera Congressional enactment truly described as infernal,—the Legislature, by an overwhelming vote in bothhouses, in accordance with the humane, moral and religiousfeelings of the people of Massachusetts, withoutdistinction of party, too powerfully expressed to besafely disregarded, requested his removal from office atthe hands of the Executive. While his case was pending,every effect was made by the journals we have designatedto intimidate and brow-beat the Senate andthe House, and to shield that infamous Judge of Probatefrom all condemnation, by a pretended concern forthe parity and independence of the Judiciary! But invain did they rave and foam at the mouth:—the Legislaturewas composed of men who could neither be bribednor overawed, and it proceeded to the performanceof its high duty without fear or favor. Then came afresh howl from those journals, as from the regions ofthe lost! Still, there was the Executive to take final actionupon the subject; and so they used every artificeto induce Gov. Gardner to keep the slave-catcher in hispolluted office, and to override the unmistakable demandof the people. To his shams and lasting infamy,he yielded to their mingled clamor and flattery; andthen, what shoats of exultation they raised, joined inby the harmonious of yells of the whole body of Southernmen-stealers and oradle-plunderers! By tee passage of the Fugitive Slave Bill, the Southernman-hunter was allowed to enter our State, andto lay his piratical hands upon any men, women orchild, no matter of what complexion, as his fugitiveslave, and to carry his victim of without a jury trial,an interested and ex-parts evidence brought from theSouth, at the and of a putty Commissioner, when astray horse could not he recovered without 'due processof law,' and a verdict rendered by twelve men impaneledas a jury. To  this unconstitutional, and to throw around the  of thisCommonwealth all these safeguards against being kidnapperswhich they are entitled to, the Legislature a Personal Liberty Bill, in entire with the principles of justice and humanity, in the asit goes; not forbidding the slave-hunter to solve andremove his prey, under any circumstances, as it shouldhave done, but only forbidding cooperation and assistanceon the part of the officers and members of theState government named them, in the imprisonment orvendition of any person claimed as a fugitive slave.This Bill is entitled 'As Act to Protect the Rightsand Liberties of the People of the Commonwealth ofMassachusetts.' New, when it is remembered thatthere are thousands of colored citizens in this State.who are daily liable to have their house invaded, andtheir fire-sides made desolate, by prowling bloodhoundsfrom the South—nay, more, that all complexional distinationshave long since caused among the slave population,and therefore the peril of seizure in universal—no man in Massachusetts, worthy of the name, will saythat the Bill is too stringent in its provisions, or tooexacting in its requirements, so far as penal legislationis concerned, Let him suppose the came his own, as heis morally bound to do —or that of his father, or mother,or wife, or child, or brother, or sister—claimed asthe property of another, to be a life-long slave, withno more freedom of mind or action than a dumb beast,and then any whether the liberty of the citizen is toocarefully guarded by the recent enactment of the Legislature. no matter of what complexion ex-parts      The Personal Liberty Bill was panted by bothbranches of the Legislature with great unanimity.Immediately there arose from the pro-slavery journalsof Boston a terrible outcry of 'Nullification!' 'Treason!'&C. &C.—in which all the Southern newspapersjoined to full chorus, assisted by Bennett's Herald, theNew York Journal of Commerce, the Albany Argus,and other satanic presses. Again they invoked Gov.Gardner to veto the action of the Legislature; again heresponded to their appeal; and again they made thewelkin ring with their shouts of exaltation. Herald Journal of Commerce Argus But the cause of freedom is stronger than the purchasedpresses of the city and country, and will go on,'conquering and to conquer.' Boston no longer rulesthe Commonwealth with a rod of iron. The people ofMassachusetts have made up their minds to have nomore slave hunts in their borders; and they will notonly cordially endorse, but firmly sustain the action ofthe Legislature for the protection of 'their rights andliberties.'

 We copy from the Cincinnati Columbian the followingaccount of the circumstances attendant upon thedeath of Mr. Elijah Willis, a wealthy citizen of SouthCarolina, who died suddenly in Cincinnati, a few dayssince, after bequeathing by his will freedom to ten ofhis slaves, and leaving all his property, to the valueof $150,000, to be divided among seven of them: Cincinnati Columbian On the 28d of February, 1854, a fine-looking, corpulentgentleman, apparently about sixty years of age,came to this city in search of Dr. Brisbane, from whomhe wished advice as to the proper course to pursue toeffectuate the manumission of a number of his slaves.Not readily finding Dr. Brisbane, he obtained the adviceof John Joliffe, Esq., and had duplicate willsdrawn up. One of these he took with him, and theother he deposited with Mr. Joliffe, to be used if heshould die suddenly, and the will in his possession beaccidentally or purposely destroyed. He stated thatone of his brothers had died very suddenly, and thathe himself, being subject to palpitation of the heart,was liable to be also summoned to another world at amoment's notice. Elijah Willis—that was his name—stayed only a fewdays in Cincinnati, but his bright, benevolent countenanceand manly frankness were not soon forgotten bythose whom circumstances had thrown into contact withhim. Returning home, he drew up a complete inventory ofall his property, and making two of his neighbors hisconfidants, he deposited this inventory with them, tobe used in case of his sudden death, at the same timemaking them pledge themselves not to make it publicpreviously. He was largely engaged in the lumber business, andraised no crops except what were necessary for the supportof the twenty-nine full grown slaves and the numerousslave children that he owned. The lumber gotout by his slaves was rafted down the Edisto river. Inthis business, Mr. Willis had amassed a large estate.He was noted fur the kindness with which he treatedhis slaves, who were never driven with the whip, norshut out by a lock from the stores of provisions. Theyate in the kitchen part of the same food that Mr. Willisate in the parlor. A number of the relatives of Mr. Willis, who are allin comfortable circumstance, lived near him, but seldomvisited his residence. His housekeeper was adark, but very shrewd mulatto woman, whom he purchased,with her mother, brother and sister, aboutthirteen years ago. This housekeeper's name was MaryAmy Elmore Turner. Her father, who was owned byanother master, had deserted her another, and for thiswas sold to a cotton planter in Alabama. Amy, as the housekeeper was ordinarily called byMr. Willis, while the slave of a former master, a Mr.Kirkland, had a colored husband, by whom she hadthree children before he was sent South. This woman, by her faithfulness and shrewdness, soonacquired great influence over Mr. Willis, by whom shehad three children. She watchfully superintended hisdomestic affairs, attended to the wants of the slaves, andadvised as to the business. Mr. Willis, feeling concerned for the future welfareof his children, and urged thereto by Amy, at last determinedto free bar, her mother, her six children, herbrother and her sister. When he came to Cincinnati,one year ago, and had his will written, it was to carryout this intent. After his return home, he arranged all his businessas rapidly as possible, and taking notes for outstandingdebts due him, made preparations for disposing of hisentire estate, and moving to Ohio, where be proposed tolocate on a farm, with Amy, her mother, and the children.Finding that the expense of bringing Amy'sbrother and sister and their families would be considerable,and that there might be some difficulty in at oncesecuring a home, Mr. Willie concluded finally to comeNorth with Amy, her mother and the children, andhaving secured for them a residence, return to close upthe business and bring the others. On last Tuesday week, they left home as thus proposed.On reaching Louisville, they got on board thesteamer Jacob Strader, and reached here at 6 o'clockyesterday morning. Soon after the boat touched thewharf, Mr. Willis and his company went on shore, andhe called a carriage, when, just as be went to reachone of the small children into it, be breathed heavily.Amy asked him if be bad another attack of palpitationof the heart. He nodded affirmatively, gave two orthree heavy breathings, and then fell dead. Just at this moment, some one asked where theycame from. Amy's mother did not answer, and wasthreatened with being kicked into the river. Some oneurged Amy to go on beard the boat again, and she refused.By the advice of a friend, she at once securedthe money (about $680) in Mr. W's possession, notesand due-bills amounting to three or four thousanddollars, a gold watch, and other valuables. She wastaken with the trunks and the body of Mr. Willisto the Dumas house. Dr. Menzies, being called in, held an inquest, whena verdict was returned in accordance with these facts. Mr. Ball, of the legal inn of Chant &Ball, beingcalled in, the will of Mr. Willis, found an him, wasopened and read, when it was found that he had willedhis whole estate to Amy and her children, and had appointedJohn Joliffe, A.H. Ernst and Edward Harwoodas executors. This will is a duplicate of that left in thecars of Mr. Joliffe, which has not yet been opened. Ifthe property is obtained, each or these colored childrenwill have a fortune of twenty-five or thirty thousanddollars. The body of Mr. Willis will be buried to-day.The executors of the will are all residents of this city. 

 DEAR FRIEND, W.L. GARRISON: EAR RIEND ARRISON I send thee for insertion in THE LIBERATOR, if thencanst find room for it, a correspondence which tookplace between myself and Abram Pryne, than editor ofthe Christian and Citizen, published at Peterboro',N.Y., now, I think, of a paper called The Reformer,published at Syracuse. A principal reason for askingan Insertion of the correspondence in THE LIBERATORis the circumstance, that the last article in the series,in rejoinder to his Reply—which was promptly forwardedto him, with a request that he would give it aplace in his paper—has not, that I am aware, beeneither published or noticed by him; although I havewritten him several times asking what had become ofit, and, in the last instance, requesting the favor that,if he declined publishing it, he would return me themanuscript. But not a syllable have I received fromhim. What can have induced this singular conduct,on the part of friend Pryne, I am uninformed, or howbe can reconcile it with his professed character, as botheditor and preacher, of 'reformer,' and the advocate oftruth and anti-sectarian principles. I omit, for brevity,the insertion at length of our friend Pryne's noticeof the Yearly Meeting, which led to the correspondence, as all that is material in that notice to thematters in discussion is embraced in my first article. HE IBERATOR Christian and Citizen The Reformer HE IBERATOR Lovingly thine for the promotion of truth and goodness, THOMAS M'CLINTOCK. WATERLOO, 7th month 10th, 1855. ATERLOO ESTEEMED FRIEND A. PRYNE: STEEMED RIEND RYNE I have just read, in the Christian and Citizen of the15th ult., which thou west so kind as to send me, thybrief notice of the; Yearly Meeting of CongregationalFriends,' held here a few days previous. I want to saya word to thyself and readers, regarding some remarksin that notice. Citizen Thou sayest—'The movement is as yet merely negative.It denies the past, talks hopefully of the futurein religion, but, I fear, hardly comprehends and adaptsitself to the present.' Now, here are several allegationsto which I am impelled to demur, as calculated to givean erroneous impression of the Society. 1st. 'The movement is as yet merely negative,' Iam at a loss to imagine on what thou couldst have predicatedthis assertion. If thou hast read the publicationsof the Society, and the Basis of Association onwhich it was organized, and which has been printedannually as an appendix to its proceedings, thou canstnot, I think, have failed to perceive, that in both doctrineand practice it has been everything the reverse ofnegative, except in the sense in which every individualand association ought to be negative, to wit, by notfollowing a multitude to do evil, in embarrassing thefree exercise of conscience, by unessential creeds andtests. But in its principles and objects—in the greatfundamentals of religion and morals—it surely is positiveenough; at least I am certain it has been, fromthe first, the desire and intention of those engaged inthe movement, to make it so. And hence we have invitedreformers and conservatives, of all names andclasses, (my friend Pryne with the rest,) to meet withus on a free platform, and give us the truth they deemimportant to mankind, however it may conflict with ourown views. If, therefore, either in our theology, or inthe practices advocated or opposed, we are not sufficiently positive, a good opportunity presents for the loversof truth and man to make us so; and, I think, Imay safely warrant them a kind and friendly hearingin their efforts. But it cannot be that my friend Prynewill now say that our 'movement is as yet merely negative,whatever, at the moment of penning the paragraph,may have led to the assertion. He Saw, during his attendance at that meeting, too many vices and evilsarraigned, and portrayed in their true character, toadmit of the statement. positive merely 2d. 'It denies the past' Is this true, as an unqualifiedproposition, or in any reprehensible sense? Webelieve truth is eternal, the same yesterday, to-day,and forever, and gladly recognize it, where we can, inthe records of the past. But, believing in the law ofprogressive development, in both physical and mentalbeing, we cannot admit any collection of writings in theworld as standards of truth, either in physics, religion,or morals; and to expect to find truth unmixed witherror in the records of remote ages, seems to us muchmore unreasonable than to look for it in those of thepresent age. standards 3d. As regards our hopefulness 'of the future inreligion,' I hope this is true. And I can also rendilyentertain the 'fear,' that our movement 'hardly comprehendsand adapts itself to the present.' For a reformatorysociety perfectly to comprehend and adapt itsaction to the present exigency, is an attainment as rare,probably, as it is desirable. I can only say, it is ouraim to do so. hope Again, thou sayest—' A reform that is not basedupon Christianity is to me without a soul. Christ, merelyas a moral head, is far above all others, and as aworld Savior, is the star of our hope. Whatever goodmen can do on humanitarian ground merely, onecan welcome and aid, but, at the same time, say to theworld's reformers, come up higher into the gospellight.' The natural inference from what is here said,I think is, that in thy estimation our reformatory actionis not based upon Christianity—in other wordsthat the principles on which we operate are exclusive ofChristianity, a carrying out, simply, of the benevolentprinciples of our nature. Now, our judgment ofthe correctness or incorrectness of the allegation willdepend on our views respectively as to what Christianityis, and in what respect, if any, it differs from humanity;by which I mean the perfect development ofman's nature. As I regard the correct perception oftruth on these points of great practical moment, the interestI feel in thee, and also our reformatory and antisectarian movement, leads me to desire that on all sideswe may be right, and, if possible,' see eye to eye.' Toaid us in the investigation of the subject, permit me topropose for thy consideration the following questions: humanity; 1st What is Christianity? 2d. When, and with whom did it originate? 3d. Is Christianity absolute religion— absolute morals,the result of the action of perfect and universalDivine laws, and therefore as old as the period whenconscious moral agents existed to be the subjects of thoselaws, and at all times open to the cognizance and appreciation of man, by the principles of his nature; oris it an arbitrary code of religion and morals, which,having its origin at a particular period of the world,with a particular pares or persons, rests on as historical basis, and is therefore as incidental and contingenttruth, to be received on the authority of the declarationof a historical record? 4th. Are love to God and love to man the  andsubstance of Christianity?  5th. Is not man, in the inherent principles of his nature,the work of Infinite Wisdom, Goodness, Power;and can that Wisdom and Goodness have conferredon him any one faculty, which, in its proper use, willnot contribute to his perfection sad happiness; and ifso, will not ail his faculties, properly used, secure hishighest welters, temporal and eternal? Can, therefore,Christianity, or true religion, he lass or more than theharmonious and perfect development of man's divinelyendowed powers? And are not the religions and moralamong the constituent elements of his being? 6th. Is there say other aviation for the world thanthis: 'to  to do evil, and learns to do good'?—inother words, that mankind, by the power disposed tothen from the Fustian of Infinite perfection, InfiniteWisdom and Goodness, over the perverted actionof their God-like faculties, and attain to their normaland harmonious exercise? Would not this save allfrom vise and its student , and fit them forthe enjoyment of God and , and all that is lovelyand benefit on earth?     This for truth and humanity. THOMAS M'CLINTOCK. 

 THE PRINCIFLED AND OBJECTS OF THE PROGRESSIVEFRIENDS. We bare cheerfully complied with the requestof our friend THOMAS MCCLINTOCK, of Waterice,(N.Y.,)—a highly-esteemed preacher among the Congregationalor Progressive Friends—in publishing, anour last page, the discussion respecting the Principlesand Objects' of that Society between himself and theeditor of the Peterhoro' Christian and Citizen; first,because he does not appear to have been allowed a fairhearing by the letter; secondly, because the subject isone of vital importance to the progress of reform; andthirdly, because the discussion, long as it is, cannotfail to interest, throughout, every candid mind andearnest sockor after truth who shall comm. its per.The charges as superficially made and as brought against the new movement, by theChristen and Citizen. are most critically examinedand most ably refused, in the best spirit, and as a solidbais. HE RINCIFLED AND BJECTS OF THE ROGRESSIVE RIENDS. HOMAS C LINTOCK Christian and Citizen    Christen and Citizen. 

 We gave, at the time we wrote on that subject, ourimpressions concerning the Progressive Friends' Theseimpressions remain the same as when first expressed,and we proceed to justify them. We think the movementnegative, because it does not propose any definiteline of conduct by which to combine its efforts to redeemthe world. It has no preachers, lecturers, publicationsor special agencies, that we knew of, throughwhich it acts. Its basis is a statement of abstract principles,but presents no associated plan for carryingthem out It denounces slavery, but refuses to voteagainst it. It rebukes governmental crimes, but refusesto elect just men as rulers, or vote at all. 'Vices andevils were arraigned,' but no practical plan, other thanthat of bearing 'testimony' on general principles, wasadopted to destroy these vices. To us, such as associationis 'merely negative.' 2d. 'It denies the past' Our friend M'Clintockproves our statement at this point to be correct, by saying,'We cannot admit any collection of writings in theworld as standards of truth.' Of course, this is denyingthe authority of the Bible as a standard, and asthis Bible has given character to the past, to deny it isto deny the past. This declaration in even more definiteand sweeping in its denials than was our charge. Weneed say nothing more on that point. 3d. That the movement is ill-adapted to the presentis proved by its negative character. It presents noplan of associated and combined action for the overthrowof popular sins, or the systematic cultivation, as socialbeings, of the graces and virtues of Christianity. Itrepudiates Christ as its head or leader, and his churchas a model of religious society. Instead of regeneration,it talks of development All society is a developmentof what is now in the human heart, and before developmentand help us, the soul, to be developed, mustfirst be regenerated. Until you preach regeneration,instead of development, you will fail to 'adapt yourmovements to the present.' All the crimes of to-dayare but developments of what is in man. He must havea new interior life before he can manifest a new out-wardlife. 4th. Love to God and love to man are the essence ofChristianity. But Jesus Christ is an authoritative exponentof the tests and applications of love to God andman; and that movement that rejects him as authoritativein guiding and enlightening that love, is not to betrusted as an exponent or exemplar of that love. 5th. Christianity originated in the bosom of God, andin its essential principles is older than all the records oftime, and had its birth before material things took form.But Jesus came in a dark age to reveal and restore it,and that revelation and restoration is authoritative,both in generals and in particulars. He who deniesthat authority wanders guileless through the fields ofreligious speculation. His system is not arbitrary, butis imperative, because founded upon infinite reason, andwhere human reason is too weak to see the truth, faithlinks it to the divine reason, and it follows Christ as aguide. 6th. The proper 'use of our faculties' will lead us toperfection. But Christ reveals to us the only way tocultivate and properly use these faculties, and whenwe reject him, there is no hope that we will properlycultivate or use these faculties. Christianity is morethan the 'development' of man's powers. It regeneratesand directs these powers in the road of development;and he who seeks this end by any other thanits divinely appointed means, will fail. 7th. There is no salvation except in ceasing to do evil,and learning to do well. But man, with his alreadyperverted faculties, is not to be trusted to learn what isevil, and how to do well; and hence God sent his Soninto the world to show us the way of goodness, and byhis Spirit move us to walk in that way. If we rejecthim, we are sure to remain still. He is the 'Way'from error to goodness, the 'Truth,' which makes usfree, and the model of the 'Life' of the true man. Thesimple fact that these Friends profess to love truth andfollow goodness is no evidence of the value of theirmovement. All sects in Christian and heathen landsmake the same high professions. Hume, Bolingbrokeand Voltaire were professed worshippers at the shrineof virtue and truth. But they rejected the Bible andthe Savior as authority, and, of course, failed to findtruth or virtue. Every modern phase of Infidelity hascome up as a reform, and professed a better and broaderplan of redeeming the race than the plan of Christ.Taking as a basis love to God and man, and truth as aguide, is indeed to adopt some beautiful and takingphraseology; but when we reject the great model andexemplar of both as our guide, our profession is liableto be only a new and specious form of selfishness. Toaffirm that reason and the human soul are absolute, andthat our own minds are to be our only guide, is, in ourestimation, blank infidelity, and whatever may be thegood we seek, on such a basis, we shall only fall intodarkness. WATERLOO, 8th month, 7th, 1854. ATERLOO ESTEEMED FRIEND, A PRYNE: STEEMED RIEND RYNE I write not for controversy, but truth; truth forthee, truth for myself, and for all who may happen toread or give attention to what may pass between us. I am a good deal disappointed in thy answer. I expecteda ready admission, that, in asserting that themovement of the 'Congregational or ProgressiveFriends 'is' merely negative,' 'denies the past,' &C.,thou hadst spoken precipitately. I expected this, becausethe case appeared to me too plain to admit of difference of opinion. And allow me to say, the groundsof thy justification seem to me not less inconclusive thanthe primary positions. Let us look at them as brieflyas will consist with perspicuity. 1. 'We think the movement negative, because itdoes not propose any definite line of conduct by whichto combine its efforts to redeem the world.' Incorrect.Our Basis of Association constitutes all our meetings afree platform, on which every individual may exercisehis conscience, without impediment, in promulgatingtruth, according to his convictions, in all its attractionsand power, and in detecting and portraying error inall its injurious properties and hideous forms. Andour 'larger meetings—Quarterly or Yearly'—it isexpressly stated, are to be 'for counsel and advice, andfor the considerations and promotion of the great interestsof humanity, every thing that concerns man atlarge, including, of consequence, the removal of theexisting evils of the day, War, Slavery, Inter pers,Licentiousness, or in whatever form cruelty, injustice,and other perverted principles, may operate' Is thisa negative movement? Is there here no definite lineof conduct by which to combine effort? If there is not,I know act where to find it. Was there any thingmore definite is the action of what is called the primitivechurch—the assemblies which witnessed the laborsof Jeans and his ? Was their movement, too,'merely negative'? I am sure ours embraces whatPaul calls 'the foolishness of preaching,' by which,he says, 'it pleased God to save them that believed,It is by the preaching of rightness and a practicecorresponding with it, that we hope to do somethingtoward the redemptive of the world. The one principalof association, practically uring perfect libertyof conscience to all, irrespective of age, sex, conditionor opinion, is itself a mighty element of a positivecharacter, desisted, I trust most beneficially to mouldother associations; and of which I have yet to find aparallel in say other professedly religious bodies.Show me such, and I will gladly bail than as brethrenand co-workers in human redemption. andfor the considerations and promotion of the great interestsof humanity, every thing that concerns man atlarge     2. 'It has no preachers, lecturers, publications, orspecial agencies, that we knew of, through which itsets.' Strangely incorrect. We have 'preachers' agoodly number; and had my friend Pryne attended themeeting as First-day morning and afternoon, he couldnot have made the tion. Preaching, so I havesaid, in with us, as in the  church, the distinguishinginlity. We have our publication,too, which we have issued from time us time, andwhich have been  of decided tracingthe attention of many to the important principlesof our movement. And these, and our preachers,are the 'special agents' through which we act.True, we have me periodical newspaper organ, norhired lecturers, though there is nothing to prevent ourhaving both, I' deemed wise and right. But are theseindispensable to give the positive element to society?If so, the society of truth-loving reformers in the apostate day were destitute of that element. But the affirmativeseems be me too  to be entertained fora movement.       3. Its Basis is a statement of principles,but presents no associated plan of carrying them out.'Entirely incorrect, as already shown. 4. 'It denounces slavery, but refuses to vote againstit. It rebukes governmental crimes, but refuses toelect just men as rulers, or vote at all.' As a body,we have no law against voting or participating in thegovernment of the country in which we live. Manyde vote, and do participate. Other conscientiouslydecline, of which class I am one. I never voted for agovernment officer but once, and that very many yearssince, and then did not cast a full vote. But in thiswe leave each to be fully persuaded in his own mind,and accord the right freely to express our convictionson the subject, in meetings or out, on the one side orthe other. To give my own views specifically now,would occupy too much space for this article; I willsimply say, they admit of coperation with humangovernments in all things in which they are not in conflictwith the Divine government, or in which coperation,no partnership exists in works of unrighteousness.But here again I may refer thee, as argument medhominem, to thy 'model' and 'world-savior.' Didhe vote, or participate in the governments that thenwere, or recommend others to do so? 'My kingdom,'be said, 'is not of this world; If it were, then would myservants fight,-that I should not be delivered to the Jews.And did not his immediate disciples, and their convertsgenerally, decline such participation? They seem tohave thought, with their Teacher, that there was agreater instrumentality for doing good than voting.'To this end,' said he,' was I born, and for this causecame I into the world, that I should BEAR WITNESS TOTHE TRUTH'—which, from the declaration precedingjust cited, meant other witness to the truth than votingand participating-in despotic persecuting, war-makingand slavery-sustaining governments.   argument medhominem 5. And now as to the charge that' it denies the past.'Our friend M'Clintock,' thou says, 'proves our statementat this point to be correct, by saying, "We cannotadmit any collection of writings in the world asStandards of truth." Of course, this is denying theauthority of the Bible as a standard; and as this Biblehas given character to the past, to deny it is to denythe past.' This to me is a marvellous justification.Let us look at it. Not to admit any collection of writingsin the world as perfect standards of truth, (for ofsuch standards the context shows I was speaking,) is todeny the authority of the Bible as a standard; and asthis Bible has given character to the past, to deny it assuch standard is to deny the past!! Have no otherwritings than those in the Bible given character to thepast? Have not the sacred books of the Hindoos, thewritings of Confucius, the Koran of Mahomet, thewords of the philosophers and civilians of Greece andRome—not to speak of the thousands of more moderndate—have not these all' given character to the past'?and to deny them as standards of truth, is that to denythe past? Plainly not. To deny any fact or truthof history is so far to deny the past. But have I notsaid, 'We gladly recognize truth, where we can, in therecords of the past'? All of the past is before us forexamination, and none of its archives are to be accepted,without competent evidence, as 'standards',either in physics, morals, or religion. To do so is inevitablyto give up our minds to the conduct of error.And let me ask. What dost thou mean by 'the authorityof the Bible'? Has it any authority other thanthe evidence and force of the truth it contains? Andhow are we to get evidence of truth, but by the actionof perfect laws, provided of God for its revelationto us? And as God is at every point of every lawthat operates, it is correctly said that he reveals it tous by his spirit, 'even the deep things of God.' Inregard to moral and religious truth, so beautifully hashe adjusted the human mind, in its normal action, toits perception, that, in respect to the great essentialprinciples, it seems to shine by its own light; it is self-evident;it comes by intuition; it presents itself at thevery point of duty where we need it. Though strictly,no doubt, it is revealed to us by Divine Light, as externalobjects are revealed by the light of the sun. perfect standards The 'authority of the Bible,' then, that which givesvalidity to any moral or religious truths it contains, isthe Light of God in the mind. The authority of theBible, therefore, and the Bible itself, are two very differentthings. The first is our highest and most perfectstandard; the last, a repository of important truthsand hurtful errors, between which it is our indispensableduty to discriminate by the light God gives us.Let me ask thee, dost thou accept the whole Bible as thetruth of God, and thy standard of faith and practice—Old Testament and New? If not, which part dostthou accept, and how far? And what determines theein thy choice? These are momentous practical questions.Be so good as to give me a clear and full answerto them. thy standard of faith and practice I am disappointed in thy reply, in another respect:it fails to answer the important question I first proposed,and on which must turn most of the real or apparentdifference between us, viz., what if Christianity?I find assertions as to what Christianity does, but nostatement of what Christianity it. I would accept thyadmission, that 'love to God and love to man are itsessence,' but that thou hast thrown around this admissionso much of an extraneous character as to depriveit, to a great extent, of its value as a definition. Letus endeavor to understand each other in this matter.In order to do this, we will look at thy main positionsbearing on the subject. These may be comprised insome half dozen propositions, which, for perspicuity, Iwill state and examines. does 1. 'The essence of Christianity is love to God andlove to man. It originated in the bosom of God. Ithad its birth before material things took form. Its essentialprinciples are anterior to all the records oftime.' To this preposition, of course, I have no objection,except it be the incongruity of the existence of a religionbefore human beings existed to be the subjects ofit. The statement contains two important concessions:1. That love to God and man is the causes or substancesof Christianity. 2. That it had its birth beforeJesus had his birth, being 'in its essential principleselder than all the records of time.' It did not, therefore,originate with him, but stands independent of anynecessary connection, either with James or the Bible.And it must needs be so, if it be absolute or true religion—the tie which binds the finite to the Infinite—(and if not that, we want something better.) For, tosuppose that so important and sublime a previsionwas committed until many thousand years after the tionof mankind, would be sadly to refuse on the Divinegoodness. But this point also is conceded in thy statement,that' James came in a dark age to reveal andrestore it. 'Had it not previously extend, not only inprinciple, but practice, it could not be revised.  practice 2. 'Jesus of Nazareth—called "the Christ," and"See of God"—is the only authoritative exponent ofwhat constitutes love to God and man, having beensent of God to that end. He came in a dark age, toreveal and restore Christianity,—(that is, to show menwhat love to God is, and what love is men is, and tobring them to the experience of ,)—and that revelation,which is contested in the revised of the and  of Jesus in authoritative in all  of and practice: he who  from it " the fields of religious "I have substituted 'only authoritative  foron authoritative exponent,' used by that, following—'he who denies that authority wandersguideless,' &C.—seeming clearly to demand it. Besides,I find the word 'only' subsequently used by theein an equivalent sence. Any other sence, indeed, wouldvitiate thy argument, as every good man is 'an authoritativeexponent of love to God and man.' He givesdemonstrable evidence of both in his daily life, his pietyand benevolence. But how can it be true that Jesusis the only exponent of love to God and man, or' of thetests and applications' of love to God and man'? Didnot thousands, of all nations, before his advent, feelthat love, and give evidence that they understood itstests and applications too?—and thousands since thattime, who never had access to the record of his doctrines? Had not God implanted the principles of bothin man's nature, no declaration of Jesus, nor any oneelse, could convey to a single human being an understandingof either, nor of their 'tests and applications.' Cant thou refer me to any tests or applicationsof this principle, which had not been previouslyrecognized by calightened minds? When the scribeinquired of Jesus, which was the greatest commandment,be referred him to two injunctions of the Pentateuch,embracing this very principle of love to Godand man, without the slightest intimation that therewas any thing new in it, and the scribe as readily recognizedtheir importance, saying they were 'morethan all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifice.'            guideless good man  3. 'The proper use of all our faculties will lead usto perfection, but only the doctrine and practice ofJesus, as exhibited in the record, can show us the wayto cultivate and properly use our faculties' If Jesus has given any disertation on the cultureand use of our faculties, I should like to see it. Hisonly teaching applicable to the point, that I remember,was to refer all to the law written in the mind.  4. 'It is true, there is no salvation but in ceasing todo evil, and learning to do well. But here, again, itis only by reference to the teaching and life of Jesus,that we can know what is evil, and how to do well.Man's faculties, already perverted, are not to be trustedwith the decision. The doctrines of Jesus comprisea system or plan for redeeming the race, the receptionof which is imperative on all, because founded on infinitereason; and though our reason fail to see itstruth, we must adopt it, and follow Christ as a guide.Yet is this system not arbitrary, though it require ablind and unreasoning faith.' Here, again, I am glad to find the admission of a fundamentaltruth, that there is no salvation but in ceasingto do evil, and learning to do good. No man, norrace of men, can be saved or redeemed, but by ceasingfrom the practice of evil, and in the proportion thatthey do no. To the extent that any one is in the practiceof it, he is its slave and victim, and must sufferthe penalty. And dost thou mean to say, that none beforeJesus came knew evil and good, and were savedfrom the former, and blessed by the latter?—or thatnone now can have this knowledge, without recurrenceto his life and teaching? Then indeed has the conditionof the countless myriads of mankind, before andsince, been inexpressibly deplorable? Yet this is thelegitimate deduction from thy position, that 'Christonly reveals to us the way to use our faculties,' andthat these faculties are 'not to be trusted to learn whatis evil, and how to do well.' Thou wilt perceive thatthe proposition I have deduced from the positions takenin thy remarks, lands in the doctrine of implicit faith!I think the deduction fair and inevitable from the premises.If thou thinks otherwise, please make it appear.And here let me remark, that thy assertion thatthe system of Jesus (if any thing properly to be denominateda system can be deduced from the existingrecord of his life and doctrines) is founded on infinitereason, is but an assumption, and needs proof. Beautifulas was his life, and generally excellent his doctrines,he was human and finite, and therefore not infallible.By the statement of the record itself, he 'increasedin wisdom,' and therefore had not all of it.Like other prophets and divine messengers, he 'saw inpart, and prophesied in part.' And let me ask thee, artthou ready to take his doctrine and practice, in all things,as thy pattern? If so, I think thou wilt find thyselfvery much of a Jew. For, although he made war onthe defective moral code of Moses, there is no evidencein the history, that I am aware of, that he declined thepractice of the rituals of the law, or commanded othersto do so, but various examples of his observance ofthem. practice implicit faith! in all things thy pattern? Jew. But I want to say a word here on the question of thetrustworthiness of the human faculties, and the matterof infidelity. And in order to a clear understandingbetween us, I will introduce another of thy positions. trustworthiness 5. 'To affirm that reason and the human soul areabsolute, and that our own minds are to be our onlyguide, is blank infidelity.' Now, reason is absolutely reason, and the humansoul is absolutely a soul, a spiritual, immortal principlein man; and reason is one of its attributes, thehighest gift of God to man, the combined action of itsvarious faculties, that by which it perceives, compares,deduces, decides, and judges of all things, and withoutwhich it could neither know nor judge. But if thoumeans by 'absolute,' that reason and the human soulstand independent of any other cause, and that, inthis sense, our own minds art our only guide—to affirmthat is not only 'infidelity,' but atheism. The humansoul stands in connection with physical and spiritualbeing. With the first, through the bodily senses; withthe last, by its own properties. Man is dependent, forexistence and all his powers, on the Infinite God. Inthis absolute sense, be creates nothing, reveals nothing;he is simply the recipient and steward of themanifold bounty of God. Through his bodily senses,he may know the things of physical nature; andthrough hit spiritual faculties, he may know the thingsof spiritual being, so far as God intended him to know.Through these powers, which God has conferred on himas elements of his being, they are revealed to him asfacts of consciousness. They are revealed by their ownpresence, through the appropriate media; if externalobjects of vision, through the medium of physicallight; if spiritual things, through the medium of spirituallight. In regard to physical nature, others' visionis not sight to him; and when he seas an object,he does not need the word of another to make him knowthat he seas it. The testimony of another may be aconfirmation of the truth of his own senses. Andthe testimony of others, in regard to objects whichhave not come within the action of his senses, may besufficient to put him in undoubting pssion of thefacts reported. But if he doubt the testimony—if it is discrepant—if it conflict with any great naturallaw, the existence of which he knows by hisown experience, and he think it of sufficient momentto be certain regarding its truth—he mustplace himself in the required condition, by proximityto it, or the use of such instruments as will bringit within the purview of his senses. And so of spiritualthings. They are revealed, to our minds byspiritual light, the light of God, with as much certaintyas external things to our bodies by the light of thesun. And as we faithfully use our spiritual faculties,we shall as certainly see all the truth it imports u tosee, and understand its application to practice, as bythe right use of our physical powers, we can see externalthings, and learn their character and uses. Andour faculties, in both cases, must be trustworthy, atthere is an and to all knowledge; it is folly to talkabout it, either in morals, mathematics, or any departmentof science. For it is by these faculties wejudge of things, properties, relations, principles, results,morale, religion; in short, of revelation itself,and all that is revealed. We have nothing else bywhich to do it. God has given them to us to that sad,and holds us responsible for their own. This responsibilityis individual and personal; and hence, thoughwe are intended in all things to be ministers of reciprocalbenefits to such other, in judging of the great matureof truth and error, right and wrong, we are trust our own minds in preferences to the mind of anyother. For the revelation to our own minds must more certain to us than any revelations, or history of arevelation, made, or said to be made, to another . Andthe decision of our own minds, however perverted theirfaculties, must be to us imperative in regard is  atheism. undoubting   trustworthy revelation itself     So taught Jesus: 'Why judge not of what is right?' He did not tell them their were not to be trusted to decide what is evil and whatis good, but everywhere in his appeals  forgranted their reliability; recognizing the selftruth, that, as Locke well expresses it, our must be our last judge and guide in everything' Andso far is this from infidelity, it is fidelity to God andtruth, in the use of those faculties he has given judge with.       But let me refer thee to a type of infidelity that abroad in the land, and which, clothed in vestments, from the more than imperial role of the'successor of St. Peter.' to the simple black coat of thelast sub-division of protestant sects, and with its lactery inscribed with the name of the lovely youngNazarene, mounts the pulpit and occupies the chair. Its teaching is that formerly God breathed into them truth, wisdom, goodness, so that theyhad them at first hand. The word of God came to they heard for themselves and understood. was then a living, internal, personal experiment, as theperception of objects by the sun's a light is a prience. To find it, men had not to look out of themselves;it was an unfolding of God and his will, and his relation and duties, by the light of God's the present operation of his perfect laws. But now inspirationand revelation are in a Book; it is not to behad direct as formerly. God spoke his last direct andmore than eighteen hundred years age, when the tract in the Bible was penned. The Bible is God'sBook, God's word, emphatically inspiration and tion,the highest we can get; God's supreme the rule of practice to all men. Thus it denies the and greatest of all Divine truths, that on which others depend, God's present and continues the world of mind, as in the world of matter. It God's omnipresence and unchangeableness; for he has changed, and is remote from as, he sustains the same relation to the human mind be did, and inspiration is the same it ever was. It his impartial goodness, his parental character, him better to his children of past ages then of the present; for who would not infinitely hear a parent's word, receive from himself testament, than have it repeated by another one in the same flesh and blood sphere with where there would be liability of innocent error fraudulent design? Instead of calling men to the sanctuary of the soul, where only God's present be known, and where only he can be worshipped and in truth, it calls them to an outward record imperfect work of men of less or more attaitruth, and asks them to fall down and and let reason, conscience, and the religious keep silence before it. It calls them to 'the letter. to 'the spirit,' but denies that.            a Book;      present          hear             This, my friend, is the INFIDELITY, which, as leprosy, has infected whole Christendom—heart, and hand.

 The General Assembly of a Presbyterian Church isnow met in St. Louis. The principal interest representedis that of the Doctors who compose it. They arevery polite Doctors. They eschew all personalities.Their grand theme is religion; yet, if any good shouldincidentally arise to the cause of truth, to humanity, ato good morals, they would greatly rejoice. The PublicRailroad Company invited them to take a ride last Saturdayover their road to Washington, some fifty-six.miles. This ride was 'free.—gratis, —in welcome—justfor nothing.—without costing a cent.' So they deferedthe business of the Lord, and went in for the fruits.How they demeaned themselves at the depot, on thecars, or at Washington. I have not learned; nor whetherthey danced or said their prayers; and so for as humanityis concerned, it makes but precious little difference;.for the spiritual salt of all such bodies has longsince lost its savor, and is only fit to be cast out andtrodden under foot of men. Should the Assembly showany signs of life, or even kick, I will let you know it.St. Louis, May 22, 1855. ST. Louis (Mo.) May 25, 1855. Give me a Doctor of Divinity for true couragewill gladly risk going to hell in the next world for thesake of his bread and butter in this. As proof, I andyou the proceedings of those Doctors of the above Assembly, now in session in St. Louis. If such sinners benot damned, who is in danger? The following wasthe proceedings on Tuesday, the 22d May, 1855.— A communication was read from Rev. R.I. Storrs,Jr., D.D., delegate from the General American of NewYork, bearing the salutations of that body, and enclosinga resolution of the Association, respecting the silenceof the Assembly on the subject of slavery, as follows: Whereas, The silence of the General Assembly of thePresbyterian Church, N.S., at its Association, respecting the silencesubject of slavery, has seemed to this body to be a retrograde movement, calculated to excite alarm in the mindsof the friends of humanity and religion; theme. Resolved, That our delegate to that body be instructedto express our apprehension on this subject, and toassure them that we hold in abhorrence all such inaction;and that in continuing our correspondences withecclesiastical bodies having churches, in slaveholdingStates, we do it rather to bear our continued and earnesttestimony against the sin of slaveholding, than toexpress the least acquiescence in so great a wickedness. Rev. Mr. Sneed thought the Assembly would consultits self-respect by passing over this, resolution withoutnotice. Dr. McLane stated that while a delegate to this Association,some years ago, an attempt was made to passsuch a resolution, but at his instance, it was omitted.Now it has come. He thought it couched is very indecorous language, and was so hostile to every principleof courtesy and correspondence, that we should not passit over in silence.  Rev. Mr. Spencer moved it, reference to a specialcommittee. This was withdrawn after brief consideration. Rev. C.C. Parker appeared in behalf of the GeneralConvention of Vermont, very cordially expressing thefellowship and unity which subsist between the twobodies, in doctrinal opinion, and long interchangeof membership, and the earnest feeling, and wouldthe churches of Vermont on shivery and interprizes. Rev. Z.M. Humphrey appeared is behalf of the Presbyterianand Congregational Convention of Wisconsin.He entered into some detail, of the churches be represented;and expressed their sentiments on the subjectof slavery and intemperance. The correspondence being finished, Rev. Mr. Pitkinoffered the following resolution: Inasmuch as the General Association of New York hasmost discourteously taken upon itself to review the legislativeaction of the General Assembly of the PresbyterianChurch over its own churches, and also, in most ungentlemanly and abusive language, has declared itsintention, in future correspondence, to pursue the sameunchristian course; therefore. Resolved, That the stated Clerk be directed to returnthe communication of the General Association of NewYork to that body, with the intimations that we haveno farther correspondence with them. Rev. Dr. Campbell moved a substitute for the above,as follows: Whereas, The General Association of New Yorktheir last meeting, held in Madrid, declared, by a resolution sent to this General Assembly, and presented bydelegate, that the only reason of their continuing correspondencewith this body is that they may bear theirtestimony against slaveholding; therefore. Resolved, That our delegate to that body be directedto say to that Association that this General Assemblydo not regard themselves as having neglected to expresstheir sentiments in reference to slaveholding; and thatin our judgment, it better accords with the principle ofcorrespondence that the respective bodies be left to pursue their own course in reference to all matters of aecclesiastical action in their own churches. After some discussion, these resolutions were submittedto a special committee, consisting of the Rev Dr.Campbell, Rev. Henry Neill, and C.R. Robert, Esq. The Rev. Mr. Pitkin's resolutions smack of the lash.They bear the humble marks of a tyrant's meekness.They show that he prefers the fellowship of States, of thefavors slavery, to that of an honest man, who favorsliberty. The Church is self-righteous cruel and devil.Had it any regard for justice, it would never beensent its General Assembly to hold its session in a manState, where its members must, of necessity, be quarrelon hypocritical slaveholders; and where, if they are not'dumb dogs,' they must be the ungrateful recipients ofthe slaveholder's bounty. But, like Dr. Cox, their businessis to 'preach the Gospel.' They have nothing todo with morality, justice, nor humanity. The Assemblyhas been a week in session. It has had one free tripon a rail-road, has another proposed,—a ten miles excursionto eat strawberries,—eaten a public supper aDr. Bullard's church.—had an offer of free drinks froma soda palace; and some other like proposition, to performacts of great general public usefulness. May 24. The Assembly has, received invitationfrom the 'Young Men's Christian Associations a'visit their rooms'; from Professor Spencer to 'visitthe eclectic college'; from the Faculty of the Universityof Missouri to 'visit the Museum sad College. May The Assembly have actually introduced resolutionsfavor of temperance and the Maine law; and the Rev.Dr. Wilson made the following report on slavery.— Rev. Dr. WILSON, from the Committee on Bills andOvertures, reported the following minute on Slavery. ILSON The Committee bad received memorials from the Syracuse and of Iowa, of Western Reserve, the Presbyterian ofElyria, St. Joseph, Cincinnati, Ithaca, Peoria andKnox, Wabash, Athens, Maumece, Hamilton, Indianapolis,Geneva, and the Congregational church of Colden—all couched in the most respectful languages, allcomplaining that the orders of the Assembly of 1858 hadnot been complied with, and all of them calling for action on the part of the Assembly. They have also received a memorial from the ThirdPresbytery of Philadelphia, deprecating any action onthe part of this body, out of a simply regard for thepeace, unity, and prosperity of the Church. After protracted, deliberate and prayerful considerationof the whole subject, the Committee are unanimousin recommending to the General Assembly the followingaction: 1. That the General Assembly address a PastoralLetter to all the Churches under their care, reaffirmingthe action of past Assembles in regard to the sinfulnessof the system of slavery, and expressing their deepregret at the intemperateness, of word and action whichhas too often characterized the spirit of those who haveconscientiously aimed at its overthrow. 2. That a Committee be appointed to report to thenext Assembly on the constitutional power of the Assemblyover the subject of slavery in our Churches,and that we recommend this evil be removed from ourChurch as soon as it can be done in a Christian andconstitutional manner. Even this is more than could have been expectedhere. When was that 'Jerry Sneak, the Rev. Mr.Saced? Can there be no means devised, by whichsuch scoundrels can be made to feel the curse they areso willing to continue on others, in their own peoplepersons? If I could hold the lash over Mr. Sneed'sback; if his wife and daughter could be compelled tobreed children from promiscuous fathers for market, tobe raised as brutes are raised and sold as cattle are;would be desire to see an effort made for their emancipation 'pes is silence'? And yet, what better isthin, 'eloquent and educated' villain's wife and daughter then an honest black man's? If the religion of thiscountry was not tree, it could not exist a year undermuch concentrated in humanity, injustice and rascality.But religion is true, and it is radial for the time beingwith this villany.  radial for the time beingwith this villany.

 In the Massachusetts House of Representatives,On the Question of adopting the following as and Amendment tothe Consultation:— 'No person shall be entitled to vote, or be eligible toany office in this Commonwealth unless he shall havebeen born with jurisdiction of the United States.Mr. Speaker: The proposition submitted by the gentlemanfrom Ipswich, (Mr. Carey,) and which we havepreviously had before us in another form, I do not feelprepared to adopt. I dislike the idea of making suchan acidental circumstance as the mere geographical the turning point of his eligibilityof a man's birth, for all his after life; so that, howeveruseful he may be as a member of the community wherehe resides; however upright, intelligent and publicspirited; however much he may have at stake in thebusiness and pecuniary transactions of the Commonwealth;however patriotic and deeply republican hemay be in his sympathies; he must be absolutely excluded fromever holding any office whatever, merelybecause he happended to open his eyes for the first timesomewhere outside the boundary line of the UnitedStates! And this, too although he may have come tothis country when he was only five, three years, orone year, or even only six months old! Yes, eventhough he was born on board a vessel sailing under aforeign flag when within a single day's sail of the Americans.Though he might not have the faintest recollectionof any other country than our own, thoughhe might cherish a hearty love for our country and itsinstitutions, and nurture in the minds of his children astrong attachment to republicanism, yet the simple factthat he himself, by a mere chance, did not arrive hereuntil after he began to breathe, must determine thepoint whether he shall or shall not participate, in thesmallest degree, in the government to which he, withall the property he may accumulate, is made subject.This seems to me to be too narrowly and childishly proscriptive. geographical  merely even only six months old! The precise locality of a man's birth is a circumstanceover which he has no control; neither merit nordemerit accrues to him in consequence of it. We arenone of us consulted as to where we shall first beholdthe light. It would puzzle many to ascertain wherethey were born. Indeed, none of us know anything inthis respect, save what is told us. Many lose theirparents in early childhood, in that period of life whichin manhood is totally forgotten, or but faintly recalledin dim and misty recollection. Thousands of familieskeep no record of the birth-places of their children;and especially is this the case with the emigrant populationoverspreading many portions of our country. Thechildren of such, in many cases, after arriving at manhood,would be unable to prove anything with certaintyon this point; they would even be unable to satisfythemselves as to whether they were by birth either'American' or 'foreign.' But they would know, andcould demoonstrate to others, whether they were 'Americanin feeling and sympathy, whether they were mentallyqualified for public office, whether they were menof reliable character or not, and whether they had residedhere the term of time we might properly deem requisite-whether seven, ten fourteen, or twenty-oneyears; and this, I think, would be sufficient. Ourhands should not be tied be constitutional provision, sothat we cannot in any case whatsoever, legally vote forsuch person, even for the most subordinate office. ascertain birth Birth, complexion, physical stature and conformation,are arranged and determined without regard to ourwish or preference. For instance, could I have beenconsulted, I might have chosen for myself the tall form,breadth of shoulders and muscular strength of myfriend, the member from Upton, instead of my presentdiminutive proportions. [Laughter.] But the fatesordered otherwise, and, I have no complaint to make:—on the whole, Iam glad of it as a matter of convenience.The locality of a man's birth being equally accidental,I hope we shall not attempt to carry the 'native Americanidea to the extreme of a absurdity, but act rationallyand within bounds. The American party,' in thisvery 'American' city, elected, last November, a foreigner'by birth to a seat on this floor!—thus showingthat they did not intend to adhere rigidly to any suchrule as is involved in the proposition now before us.Dr. Bigelow, at present a member of this House fromBoston, was (as appears from Poole's Statistical Register)born in Canada! Yet who of us thinks the less ofhim on that account? Who of us has felt, for a moment,that that highly respected gentleman is an interloperhere, because he happened to be born outside ofthe line of the United States jurisdiction? carry foreigner' birth 'None but Americans should rule America,' is themotto of the party now in power in this State; and thishas been many times and emphatically reiterated hereduring this discussion. I accept it as expressive ofsound doctrine. But what is it to be an 'American,'in the sense of a qualification or fitness to rule? Is itmerely to be born on the soil designated by the geographicalname of 'America', and so narrowed downin interpretation as to signify just what is now included,neither more nor less, within the United States ofAmerica? I know some persons born in Massachusetts,who are far from being 'American' in feeling and character,if by 'American' you mean anything akin tosympathy for freedom, justice, republicanism, or faithin human improvement. Some 'natives' of our ownState are ingrained aristocrats,—downright monarchists,to all intents and purposes,—having little sympathyfor mankind, and little trust in the capacity ofthe people for self-government. I would not vote forsuch 'Americans' to legislate or administer, either inour Commonwealth or anywhere else By an 'American,'I mean one who is such in character—one who is'American' or republican in principle, feeling, sympathy,and impulse. A man's birth-place cannot determineanything in this respect. You have doubtlessheard, Mr. Speaker, of the English gentleman who advertisedfor a coach-driver, and in a postscript addedthat no Irishman need apply. An applicant for thestation soon presented himself, and was asked where hewas born; when he replied, 'In Ireland,' 'But,' saidthe gentleman, 'did you not see by the advertisementthat I did not wish to employ an Irishman?' To this,the other rejoined by saying that, though born in Ireland,he was no Irishman; and he added, with some indignation,'Suppose, sir, a man was born in a stable, isthat any reason that he is a horse?' [Laughter.]Though man be born in America, it does not necessarilyfollow that he is characteristically an American.Neither is a man necessarily a monarchist or anti-republicanin theory or in feeling, because he was born inEurope, or elsewhere outside the limits of a republic.Kossuth, Mazzini, and hundreds of men the other sideof the Atlantic, are every whit better republicans thansome prominent leading men in our own country at thismoment, who are loud-mouthed in their professions ofdemocracy. What kind of 'Americanism' is it that influencessuch men as Mason of Virginia, the author ofthe Fugitive Slave Bill, or Senator Butler, or StephenA. Douglas, or Franklin Pierce? Such 'Americans'have 'ruled America' too long! United States principle stable horse? Such We might with as much propriety render ineligibleall those born in Virginia, South Carolina, and someother portions of the United States, as hundreds whoare born in England or Germany. Many who are nativesof the last-named countries and who emigratehither, are from their youth upward genuine, heartyrepublicans; while many who were born and reared inthe Southern States, in the midst of the blighting socialand political influences of chattel slavery, are in sympathydespotic, unfit to hold office in Massachusetts.What sort of republican training and education wouldbe derived from the political and social atmosphere ofVirginia, where Mrs. Douglas was imprisoned for Keepinga school to teach free colored children to read; andthis, too, when she was laboring 'all for love and nothingfor reward'? One great complaint against RomanCatholics, (a complaint repeated on this floor severaltimes this session, and which we have expressed throughsome laws passed here,) is that they aim to keep thepeople is ignorance, and are for this reason hostile to free common schools. Romanists are bad enough inthis respect, without doubt; but when and where havethey ever attempted anything worse than has been realizedin Virginia and other portions of the south? So far republican fitness for office may be concerned,of what advantage would it be for a man to be born,educated and disciplined in Missouri? Events of recentoccurrence in the Territory of Kansas may serveto illustrate the sort of 'republicanism' which actuatessome of the people of, Missouri, who went over the Kansasboundary line, line, fraudulently assumed the right tovote in the organization of the Territory, threatened tohang Governor Reeder if he should interpose any barrierto their villany, overawed overawed the civil officers generally,and thus trampled upon decency, law, order andjustice! And all for the purposes of subjugating thatregion of country of the dominion of chattel slavery! The following I have clipped from a telegraphic report,in the newspapers, of the speech of Gov, Reeder,of Kansas, on his late visit to Pennsylvania. What apicture dose it present as of the principles and practicesof natives of one potion of our country; Howmuch republicanism would a person be likely to breatheinto his soul in consequence of being born in a communityof such rowdies as are herein described? He referred to the reports of frauds and outageupon the part of slavery men in the Kansas election,and emphatically confirmed the very worst statements ofthem, which had preceded his arrival. He said hisopinions on the subject of popular sovereignty had undergoneno change, but that the conduct of the peopleof the border counties of the north of Missouri had astonishedand amazed him by their reckless disregard ofall laws, compacts and constitutions; that the territoryof Kansas in her late election had been invaded by aregular organized army, armed to the teeth, who tookpossession of the ballot-boxes, and made a Legislatureto suit the purpose of the pro-slavery party.KansasWas subdued, subjugated and conquered by armed menfrom Missouri, but her citizens were resolved never togive up the fight for their freedom, and the independenceof their soil from foreign control or interference. emphatically confirmed the very worst statements ofthem reckless disregard ofall laws, compacts and constitutions; invaded by aregular organized army, armed to the teeth, who tookpossession of the ballot-boxes I think, Mr. Speaker, that there are some evils inthis country besides those resulting from foreign emigration—some equally great, and as likely to sap thefoundations of our republican institutions. When have the naturalized foreigners in any partof our country been guilty of any thing equal in enormityto the recent conduct of the Missourians? Inthis case it should be observed, the persons of whomI complain were in the strictest sense the aggressors. aggressors. What sort of a republican education would one receiveif brought up at the feet of the civil authoritiesand teachers of law and politics in Georgia—the Statewhich offered, through its Legislature, $1000 rewardfor the head of a 'Native American'—a son of Massachusettsby birth, (Wm. Lloyd Garrison,)—who all hislife bas been battling in behalf of universal freedom?What kind of 'republicanism' was inculcated by Gov.Hammond, George McDuffie, and Calhoun, when theydeclared that slavery existed by divine right, that itWas of 'patriarchal' origin and authority, and that itWas even the 'corner-stone' of the American government? How much better would any man be, for havingbeen born and reared in the midst of such teachers,than if born in England or Germany, or even in Austria? One of the members from Boston (Mr. Farwell) has,during this discussion, quoted the saying attributed toWashington, 'put none but Americans on guard!'His application of it is, that we should electelect none butAmericans to office, under any circumstances. Allowme as I have said before, to define what makes an American, and I do not object of to the doctrine. But Ithink there is not a little cant in this frequent reiterationof the alleged danger of giving any other persons'on guard' than those born on American soil, who,let me ask' sought to betray the cause of freedom duringthe American Revolution? Was it Lafayette, thenative Frenchman? Or Kosciuezco, the native of Poland?or Baran de Kalb, the native German? or RichardMontgomery, the native Englishman? No! it wasa 'Native American'—Benedict Arnold—who wasborn in the wooden-nutmeg State of Connecticut! Notruer patriot or more devoted soldier participated inthe struggle of the colonies against Great Britain, thanwas Baron de Steuben, the native Prussian, who cast inhis lot with our Revolutionary sires, and but for the timely aid of the State of New York in the grant ofland, and a generous pension from Congress, wouldhave died in poverty. He sought not to secure evenposthumous distinction or homage, but made an earnestrequest that his body might not be buried with pompand display, but wrapped in a cloak, and deposited inan obscure place, with no monument to mark the spot.Not one of his contemporaries was more shocked andgrieved than he at the treachery and perfidious characterof Arnold. Says a historian of the time, 'So greatwas his abhorrence of every thing mean and contemptible,that he could never endure the name of GeneralArnold, after that dishonorable officer proved a traitorto his country. While reviewing a regiment of lighthorse, the name of Arnold happened to strike his ear,The man who bore it was ordered to the front. He was a fine-looking fellow, with horse and equipments in excellentorder,—'Change your name, brother Soldier,'said the Baron, 'you are too respectable to bear thename of a traitor!' Verily, there is considerable nonsensein the implied assumption of a necessity that oneshould prove himself native-born, before be can betrusted out of sight! makes cant To be consistent, and legitimately extend the ultra'native' idea, those gentlemen who pertinaciouslyurge the proposition now before us, should seek furtherto amend the Constitution by providing that no oneshould be eligible to office in our State unless bornwithin the limits of Massachusetts; and still further,that no one should be a County Commissioner, Treasurer,Register of Deeds, or Register of Probate, unlessborn within the County; and further yet, that noone should be a Representative in any town in the Legislatureunless a 'native' of that town. In case of theadoption of such amendments, our friend from IpswichWould be disfranchised in this Commonwealth; for heis a 'foreigner' to Massachusetts, being a native ofNow Hampshire, which has usually been reckoned, inits political characteristics, one of the Southern States—although she has recently gives signs of regeneration. to Massachusetts Southern Some of the most  advocates of the birthrightqualification we are considering feel, perhaps, like Mr.Dombey's sister, Mrs. Chick, that they must 'makean effort'—an effort to show the intensity of theirAmericanism. In this, I think they do not accuratelyrepresent the entire American party,—to say nothingof the rest of the peoples of this Commonwealth. Howeverthis may be. I do not sympathies with any 'rawhead and bloody bones' warfare upon foreigners, merelyas such. I do not adopt as my political motto therapacious song of the grim giant, in the nursery storybook:  'Fee in, fo, fum,I smell the blood of an Irishman—Dead or alive, I will have Some.'[Laughter.]   I admit that there are evils arising from the multitudinousemigration of foreigners to our country.These, however have been exaggerated, and they maybe corrected without a resort to such policy as is involvedin the proposed amendment to our fundamentallaw. To obviate the evils complained of, it would bemore proper to begin at the fountain-head—the federalgovernment Let whatever legislation is demandedcommence at Washington—lot the naturalization lawsbe revised or reconstructed, if need be, so as effectuallyto preclude, if possible, the perpetration of fraud inthe procural of naturalization papers That gravefrauds and impositions is regard to voting have beenpracticed, especially in the great states of NewYork and Pennsylvania, and in some portions of theWest, I do not doubt. It has been erted, withmuch plausibility, that was Presidential election wasdecided by the votes of men who had not resided in thecountry so long as the naturalization laws require—New York having  the  by a  of afew hundred votes, and it being evident that moneyhundreds of ballots were  by foreigners then recentlyarrived. In Massachusetts, we have never sufferedfrom this species of political corruption,—at least,not upon a  sufficiently extended to attract attention.And if we had so suffered, how would the proposedamendment prevent the recurrence of the evil?if a man can now fraudulently procure naturalizationpapers, by swearing to a lie concerning the term of hisresidence in the country, (being aided by the falseswearing of interested native citizens,) could be notwith equal facility swear that he was born within thejurisdiction of the United states? And in such case,who could gainsay his word, especially if he be removedhither from a remote part of our country? If weadopt this amendment, shall we have any thing like aneffectual safeguard against the contingency of foreignersbeing occasionally choose to office, under the suppositionthat they were native born? And supposethat, now and then, by hook or by crook, one suchforeigner should slip into some office of no great consequence,although we should deplore the fraud, shouldwe be much more disgraced or injured then we havebeen by the election of some 'natives'?      this  had some As for as our own State is concerned, the stringentproposition we are dising in entirely uncalled for.Comparatively few foreigners have ever held State officesin Massachusetts According to Poole's StatisticalRegister, the whole number of persons of foreign birthwho have I can elected as members of the GeneralCourt, including both the Senate and House, for thelast eight years, and including also the ConstitutionalConvention, is but thirty-three. The aggregate numberof all the members during that period was 64. Itthus appears that the members of foreign birth constitutedbut a very small fraction of the whole—less thanone per-cent. Only thirty-three, during nine differentLegislatures, in a State containing a million of inhabitants!Where, then, is the urgent necessity for theconstitutional change here proposed? Besides, if themajority of the people of the State really wish to electmen of foreign birth to office, would it be democratic toseek to prevent them from so doing by Constitutionalenactment? Is it not a fundamental ides of a republicantheory of government that the majority shallrule? If the majority of the people do not wish tochoose persons of foreign birth, then let them ballot fornatives only, and the matter is settled without more ado!  thirty-three.  not We ought to be discriminating and just in speakingof foreigners, and not launch forth wholesale, rantingdenunciations of them. Many of them are in principle and character truly republican—fit to be citizens assoon as they arrive here, so far as regards their sympathiesand intentions, All that is needed in their caseis, the adoption of a uniform rule prescribing a reasonableterm of residence here, so that they may becomeaffiliated with as, before exercising the elective franchiseand sharing the responsibilities of legislation.Thousands of intelligent Protestants are continuallyemigrating to our shores; and from their influence,we can have nothing to fear, but much to hope for andrejoice in. It is, doubtless, equally true, that manyare constantly coming hither, who (like some natives)are, when they arrive, unfit to be citizens any where.This class we may seek to Americanize,' in a decentsense of that term; and if they themselves are notimmediately improved, we have no occasion for beingdismayed or hallucinated by morbid fears. Their childrenwill be likely to prove intelligent, virtuous, andqualified for republican citizenship, unlessspoiled bythe bad principles and evil influences of their 'native'associates. Our foes are less from without than within. If our whole country were itself consistently republican,from North to South and from East to West,we should need to have no apprehensions of coming tonought, but could cherish a rational confidence in ourabiding security as a nation, and be a 'name and apraise' all round the globe.

 MOUNT ZION, May 19, 1855.FRIEND GARRISON:The following paragraph in copied from The LIBERATORof last week, under the head of 'Western Anti-SlaveryConvention': OUNT ION RIEND ARRISON IBERATOR Col. Ross K Price race to speak. He boasted thathe had not a drop of democratic bleed in his veins.He advocated first a constitutional republican governmentand there a theocracy, but was called to order bythe Chair, when he declared he was not an Abolitionist,and not a Member of the Convention, and sat down.' I offer explanation. I was offended at the connectionof words in one of the resolutions:—' true democracy'are the words. I believe the word 'true' improperlyconnected with democracy. Democracy, with the helpof Constitutional Republicanism for the establishment of justice,has been tried by the nation, and provedfalse to justice and righteous liberty. The fault is inthe element. The vile and the ignorant outnumber thevirtuous and the wise. The dogma that all men arecreated (politically) equal is one of the last delusionsof 'the man of sin.' Political rights are acquired 'bypatient continuance in well-doing,' and no two men acquireprecisely the same rights. true false Governments derive their just powers from GOD.The Confederacy will be broken to pieces like a potter'svessel, because the Federal Government is unjust. TheAmerican institution of slavery has been tolerated bythe HIGHER POWER (more than a quarter of a centurysince thy inspiration began the cry, 'undo the heavyburdens and let the oppressed go free') to prose democracywhere democracy is most intelligent and free—inthe free States,—and where democracy in power is led bymen sworn 'to establish justice.' OD. tolerated IGHER OWER The democratic element, subjected to the good influencesof the Bible, Abolitionism, Liberty, and Free-SoilRepublicanism, loveth not the truth, for it hathpleasure in unrighteousness. Its body-politic is dead,and 'Know-Nothing' is the result. Its national head(Federal Government) it damned; and I have, in thegallery of the House of Representatives, May 27, 1852,and in the Supreme Court room, March 2, 1853, with aloud cry made proclamation thereof. damned with aloud cry made proclamation thereof. The principles of democracy are beastly. The bodyassumes the sovereign, and the wicked "head assumes itlawful to yield obedience to its impulses; and thus theFederal head yielded or gave power unto a beast untilthe purposes of GOD are fulfilled in the experiment;for, be assured, the beastly principles of the democraticage will peas away with the elements of the man of sin,and no place be found for them. OD A Constitutional Republican Government, electedfrom above, and guided by Theocracy, is practicable,and will succeed and supplant the democratic federalgovernment in two of the three pieces of the broken confederacy.The other fragment may continue democratic long enough for a contrast You are the standard of Abolitionism, and as such, Iam in duty bound to pay you high honor. You are asecond John the Baptist. Your work is done, and welldone. You have shaken the Confederacy to its centre,and nude its heart quake with fear of a dissolution,(preceding the enactment of the peace measures of thedamned,) and there is nothing more to do under thename of Abolitionist. I would enlist thee in the kingdomof GOD—a kingdom that shall break in pieces confederatedoppressors, establish justice and judgment in the earth, and stand for over.I honor the name of Abolitionist. You are the Abolitionist—I am the Theocrat. OD You are the Abolitionist In conclusion, let me say, the Convention alluded toin the foregoing acted by democratic rules; therefore,I was ruled out. I intend no disrespect to the Convention. therefore With high regard for thee, I have the honor to be, Thy fellow-servant, REES E. PRICE.
