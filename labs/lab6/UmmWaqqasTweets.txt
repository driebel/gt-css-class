_UmmWaqqas	The test in our struggles is our ability to stay patient in times of hardships. Allah says in the Quran "Allah Loves those who are PATIENT"Nothing is impossible for Allah, & if something is meant for you it will happen. Regardless of how it does it eventually willIn life we face so many hardships & think there's no way out of them yet forget that Allah is Wali Al-Hamid. He will make a way out for youAllah says "I will make a way for you from sources you could not imagine"When you think your back is against the wall, & you feel like there is no way out for you PLACE your trust in Allah & watch things go smooth3. Alhamdulilah she made it to Ash-Shaam.  She is a sister whom I love dearly & admire, now the lesson in all of this is...2. She placed her trust in Allah & tied her camel & set out to make Hijrah. Though the path was tough & though there were obstacles2. One BIG PROBELM she was under watch by the government & was being tracked by her every move.1. Bismillah.... 

There was a sister who wanted to make Hijrah & be in a place where she can practice her deenSo I will narrate a story to you that happen to a sister, & the lesson I want you lot to take from it."Say: Verily, my prayers, my sacrifice, my life, and my death are for Allah, the Lord of All the Worlds."--Surah An'am Ayah 162I wanted to become a journalist, but looking at how bad that field has gotten ima stick with being a teacher@Maxabbes Someone leaked it.

The word "ir7ab" is actually mentioned in the Quran...Terrorists = Mujahideen

Terrorism = Jihad

They changed the words so you hate that which you are meant to love"You have to have the determination & the ability to walk alone."- Sheikh Anwar Awlaki Rahimullah

I honestly love this man Feesaabilillah!5. Some times you have to be willing to walk the road alone and situations may occur &no one is willing to stand by you."

That's it for now4. Today is a time when the ummah is at a center stage so whatever is happening in the world is sure to influence you one way or another.3. Start preparing yourself spiritually most importantly for what is yet to come. Because even if your are not going to witness these events2. He said "Dear Brother and sisters get ready, prepare yourself,  don't take anything for granted.Don't continue to live this daily routine1. I end this with an advice from Sheikh Anwar Awlaki Rahimullah.Tadkhiyah means the willingness to sacrifice.

You have to be prepared to sacrifice whatever Allah wants from you.Thabaat means steadfastness

You will need to be steadfast and firm like a mountain, so that nothing changes you. Your iman has to be STRONG2. Yet the Sahaba never turned their back, they sacrificed their limbs & with their blood established this Deen.1. What made the Sahaba Special? 

The were not only a nation That established islam but they also had the whole world against themSubhanAllah look at us now, nations have gathered to destroy Iraq & Ash-Shaam. 

Allahu MustaanDid you know? 

During the invasion of Iraq back the Ulema predicted that this could be the stepping stone for Al-Malhama...Points from this hadith: 

- Al-Ajam-referrs to Non-Arabs & also Non - Muslims (Errm UN did that) 
- The heart of Ash-Shaam is Al Quds4. "There will be a Khalifah in my Ummah who will give out money without counting."3. So the Sahaba said "who would do this" he Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam replied "Ar-Ruum" And then he said "there will be a khalifah in my2. He Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said "Al-Ajam" & then Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said "Then Ash-Shaam will go through an embargo1. An interesting hadith

Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said "A time will come when Iraq will be in a siege." He was asked "by who?"Lessons from this Hadith: 

3. Istanbul will once again come into the hand of the Muslims.Lessons from this Hadith: 

1. Running away from the Battle field is a MAJOR SIN in Islam - Hadith is in Bukhari
2. Al-A'maq is in Shaam7. They will continue till they open Constantinople." (present day Istanbul)6. Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam adds "This 1/3 who will win this battle will not be harmed by fitnah nor will they get discouraged5. 1/3 of that army will be killed & they are the best Shuhada in the eyes of Allah, & the last third will be victorious."4. 1/3 of that (muslim) army will be defeated & run away & Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam says "Allah will NEVER accept their tawbah"3. The Muslims will reply back "we will never hand over our brothers." So they will fight.2. Will go out & meet them, they are the BEST of believers at that time. And they will line up & the Romans will say "Hand over our people"1. Hadith- Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said "The Romans will attack you until they camp in Al-A'maq, so an army from Madina will3. Who became Muslim & in which we will reply "we will NEVER hand over our BROTHERS."

Not exact hadith,but it can be found in Kitab Al-Fitn2. Also there is a hadith that states whilst we Muslims are Fighting the Romans they will ask us to hand over those "Romans" who have become1. Note: this is not saying that ALL the Romans are our enemies, because we know that in the west islam is the fastest growing religionNote:

During this time there are great trails of Fitnah & it is during this time that the Dijjal will emerge & Isa Alayhi Sallam will come2. During that time the "Romans" were Europeans therefore it will carry on in that meaning. So the Romans are Europe & it's offshoot...1. During Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam's time the word "Romans" wasn't referring to a political entity rather to an ethnic group.Question: who are the Romans?
Answer: Europe & it's extensions (North America & Australia)Question: who will take part in Al-Malhama?

Answer: Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said "Al-Malhama is between the Muslims & Romans"Question: What is Al-Malhama?
Answer: Al-Malhama is a series of battles (a long conflict)Class is in session.

(Tryina spread the Khayr & ilm as I go along, any Khayr is solely from Allah & Allah alone)

I hope you lot take notesI'm In tears this is the interview with Shafi'i... 

Wallah comedy  http://t.co/lQxSsODWbkRT @YouDontKnowMee_: How can they attack a place of worship. Throw bombs & shoot bullets in a place where they bow down to their Creator? h…Israel is a terror state, they're terrorists that terrorize.Israel gets away with EVERYTHING. Hell they even got away with shooting a father & son on live TV...

bet they thought we forgot about that@Shxnkaron I was listening to a lecture & the sheikh pointed it out, also if you study in depth the history of the life after the KhalifahSo should we delay for even a moment in rejoicing upon its return?"

(Lol I added my own flavor to the original speech only at the end.)We drank all sorts of bitterness, dreaming of the day when the khalifah would return.We were patient for years in the face of being killed, imprisoned, having OUR bones broken & OUR limbs severed."We spilled rivers of OUR blood to water the seeds of the Khalifah,Laid it's foundation with OUR skulls &built it's towers over OUR corpsesHow relevant are those PRTs to our time today Adunyaaa5. But they refer instead to opinions, desires & customs that people themselves have invented ALL of which have NO basis in Allah's Deen."4. Which include every type of righteous good thing & forbid every type of evil.....3. In the Tasfeer Ibn Kathir says " in this ayah Allah is criticizing those who ignore Allah's commandments.....2.Allah says"then is it the judgment of ignorance they desire? But who is better than Allah in Judgment for people who are certain in faith"1. In the Tasfeer of Ibn Kathir Rahimullah 

Volume 3, page 67 he explains the ayahs of Allah in Surah Ma'idah Ayah 50@ShamBreaking3: Women in Somalia give Bayah to Amīrul Muminīn Abu Bakr al-Baghdādī" 

Oi @NickiManhaj look... 

http://t.co/pZ0oUWuRDI"Let's get up & pray Janazah over the ummah. We have just killed this ummah." 

Deep init! Well that's it for Islamic History stay tuned!Did you know when the Ulema of that time couldn't come together unified to quickly select a Khalif Muhammad Zawahiri said this....Did you know that the head leader for this council was none other than the Grandfather of Ayman Zawahiri?Did you know, in 1924 after the fall of the Khalifah world scholars came together in Mecca & held a Shura meeting to elect a new khalifah?Islamic History time: 

Did you know.....???? 

I found this to be lowkey shocking not gonna lie!This Deen isn't something to be played with learn ALL aspects before deciding to speak like a scholar & even then keep your mouth closed.And before speaking ill about ANY ASPECT OF THE SHARIA OR THE HUDUD OF ALLAH keep in mind that your Islam is at stake.@abdihalimsalad majority of the scholars have denounced Salahuddin in his time@abdihalimsalad pls get educated on this issue before talking. Not trying to sound arrogant but we should be fully educated in these topics@abdihalimsalad "Muslims" that go against the establishment of Sharia of Allah?And before bad mouthing any Mujahid also keep in mind that Allah Choose them over you (sitting comfortable at home)Blind sheep only follow the herd. The media only shows you what they want you to see keep that in mindThe were the nation Allah honored by sending them the most Anbiya. They also witness many miracles@abdihalimsalad You are a blind sheep who hate on those who strive in the cause of Allah. Sorry Bud Allah choose the Mujahideen > laymen@abdihalimsalad Lol, a fan girl in what sense? Don't make a fool out of yourself you only hate Dawlah because the media tells you too.Bani Israel were the chosen people by Allah. & through there story we learn many lessonsWe need more women Scholars Previous Tweet"@Pearl_of_islam1: In front of the Islamic university in #Mosul #IslamicState http://t.co/hV8s2JCCmr"

This is so amazing@abdihalimsalad Lol K... 1. I'm from Holland & 2. Don't irritate me pls@HumzMufasa @TheAbFro 

He (ﷺ) said, "Whoever obeys me, shall enter Jannah, and whosoever disobeys me, refuses to (enter Jannah)". - Bukhari@HumzMufasa @TheAbFro 

"Everyone of my Ummah will enter Jannah except those who refuse". He was asked: "Who will refuse?"@TheAbFro lol interesting huh. You should read the hadith... you'd be shocked to hear that some people actually get dragged to Jannah.It's one thing to disagree with Dawlah but another to full out go against the Sharia of Allah.Sorry fam you're just on borderline Kufr therePeople hate Dawlah for establishing the REAL sharia & the Hudud of Allah. Like you folks (Muslims) are walking on very thin ice ya knowI came across Anti-Dawlah tweets & wallah majority of them if NOT ALL OF THEM were more like haterd for the Sharia."@tahsinaaa: Load of shia's on campus with shirky posters everywhere handing out tea :( #areyounotfastingdoe"

Loool I'm deadJannah is a place made specially for you but like Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said "there will be people who will refuse Jannah"& then there is Jannah, that when you ask Allah "O Allah enter me into Jannah" 3 times it (Jannah) asks Allah for you.God forbid but some of us (me) should give it more though & learn about Jahanam... it's a reality many of us turn a blind eye toIt's actually crazy how many us of don't give Jahanam a send thought Like reality is majority of us due to our own actions may land up thereYou know Jahanam is a scary place when it seeks refuge from Allah against own itself.. 

May Allah protect usWhy did everyone change their Avis to cats? Ya3ni am I missing something hereIt sucks because the person you are arguing with doesn't think you are serious which irritates me even more :( 

Adunya 

Sabr Ya Umm Waqqasim emotionally challenged. 

It's sad whenever I'm mad I can't keep a straight face & whenever I'm seriously i always end up laughing UGH@BintWater @ghazi_dimashqi  Sorry ukht this is incorrect from the little amount of knowledge I have he freed her & then married her.In short we from among Ahlul Sunnah are different from both the Jews & the Shias.5. This day/month also marks the day Hussain Radi Allahu Anhu's Martyrdom in which was tragic but that's not why us Muslims fast on Ashura.4. Who also fasts on this day? 

The Jews also fast on this day so be different from the Disbelievers we add 2 extra days 9th & 11th3. Why do we fast? 

We fast because today marks the day that Allah saved Musa Alayhi Sallam from Firuon & his army.2. Which is incorrect, Ashura was celebrated by the Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam himself who instructed us to fast.1. Today is Ashura as many of u may be fasting (keep me in ur duas before u break fast pls) and some of us tend to tie Ashura with the shiaOne day the struggles & hardships will be all worth it.RT @aiisha_k: You are nothing but your deeds

And your deeds are nothing without pure intentions

So constantly ask Allāh to place sincerit…@Usongo4life It's still practiced till today Alhamdulilah."A believer never satisfies doing good until he reaches Jannah."-TirmidhiImagine sitting back with the Hoor Al Ayn in your yard sipping on a cup of wine from Jannah... 

Gasp... A girl can dream inniAnyways these pastries are amazing http://t.co/13p1h4ZnzN@Usongo4life It's in Seerah books & also there is a dua one makes only for those who have concubines which in Arabi is called sabayaThey skip so many aspects of his life just to highlight what they want SubhanAllah.The ignore the Jihad that Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam made & his harshness towards the enemy only to highlight his merciful sideThe Seerah in its true essence is beautiful & so amazing, I hate that watered down crap they feed us now ...Matter fact 2 wives of the wives of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam were Ghanimah until he freed them & married them...Concubines are apart of Islam it's halal for the men to have them... Even Sulayman AS had them so did Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam.The Haqq is so clear people just decide to ignore it. May Allah guide us all onto the straight path"To know who is on the Haqq look at who the arrows of the Kufar are all pointed" 

Need I say who those arrowsare pointed toward?Lol keep me in your duas so that the angel's make the same duas for you & we both benefitAnyways Ana Bint Dawlah :PAll praise is to Allah aloneThings you once held valuable or even important seem to no longer matter considering the obstacles you have to come across each dayWallahi "Reminders benefit the Believers"Use twitter to benefit from those who remind you of Allah.4. Why? Because real happiness, true contentment can ONLY be found in the hereafter alone, it comes when we are in Jannah3. You can have all the cars, houses & everything that this dunya could offer but you will never be content, You will still find a void2. Nothing you desire will EVER make you happy, it will all in the end bring you misery.

In this world you will never truly be happy1. So know if you have Allah you have everything you desire, but if you don't have Allah WALLAHI you have NOTHING

Nothing"Upon those people are the blessings and prayers of Allah, and indeed those are the ones who are truly guided."-Surah Baqarah Ayah 157"Those when they are tested they say "To Allah we Belong & to Him shall we return."-Surah Baqarah Ayah 1561. Pain & suffering only becomes negative if it creates a barrier between you and Allah. If you distance yourself from AllahAllah says "Surely we shall test you with a loss of wealth, Life, profit and trade. So give glad tidings to those who are patient."- 2:1552. But pain can also be turned into a positive, a form of motivation for you, when you decide to utilize it to get you closer to Allah.Anyways may Allah bless Ameerul Mu'mineen & grant him Jannah, unite him with the Anbiya, Shuhada the righteous predecessors...

Ameen ♡It's amazing to see the Kufar so scared & terrified at the mere site of the Mujahideen.

Allahu Akbar!

Feels like Wahn has left our hearts2. & I just watching how Dawla took over Tabqa Airport for the 20th time &wallah Allah has disgraced these Kufar by the hands of the Muslims1. In the Quran Allah says "fight them & I will disgrace them by your hands""اخي أبلغ هنا الأصحاب أني راحل مدير"

A very touching Nasheed... May Allah unite us all with our Sahabis & Sahabiyats!Tumblr worthy http://t.co/ujX9rEkbXEI think I've met 10% of my twitter followers already :D may Allah persevere you lot, it's truly amazingOne of the Salaf said:

Then i came across this Ayah in the Quran that changed it all for me ... it's in Surah Nisaa Ayah 841. I use to wonder why brothers would come back on social media to announce their Hijrah & them going out to fight FeesaabilillahThat hadith makes u seriously ponder on where u stand with Allah, seeing as people from ALL OVER THE WORLD young & old are flocking to Shaam"The hour will not be established untill Allah gathers all His Believing servants to the land of Ash-Shaam."-Abdullah Ibn Masood

These Hadiths should make you think as to why you are still in the west SubhanAllah...Alright that's it for me & my mini class lol 

I hope you enjoyed my notes, may Allah make us among those who establish His Deen firmlyPlease note that everything I talked about can be found in the SEERAH of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam taught by Ustadh Anwar AwlakiEstablishing the Army:

The 3rd Ghazwah was called "Asheerah"

But Badr was the only Ghazwah that resulted in the armies actually meetingEstablishing the Army:

1st Ghazwah was called "Ghazwatul Al-Adwab" but the Muslims did not meet its enemies

2nd Ghazwah was "Duwad"Establishing the Army:

Ghazwah is an army that was led by Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam himself for example "Ghazwatul Badr"Please Note that all these Sarayahs happened in the first 2 years before the battle of BadrObjective for a Sarayah: 

1. To establish a military presences
2. Economical reasons
3. To establish allies
4. Training for the Sahaba1. The Sarayah led by Ubaydah RA is important because it was in this Sarayah that the FIRST arrow for the sake of Allah was shot2. The Sarayah led by Ubaydah RA had in its ranks men like Hamzah, Sa'ad Ibn Abi Waqqas 

May Allah be pleased with them ALLEstablishing the Army:

1st Sarayah was led by Ubaydah ibn Harith... The 2nd led by Hamzah, a Sarayah was led by Sa'ad Ibn Abi WaqqasEstablishing the Army: 

Before the battle of Badr the Muslims engaged in something called "Sarayah" though none resulted in blood shedEstablishing the Army:

Sarayah refers to armies that were set out by Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam though he was not among themEstablishing the Army:

Sarayah linguistically means "An Army" 

Ghazwah linguistically means "The army of Conquest"Basically this covenant was established as an agreement for all the communities from Muhajiroon & Ansar, Muslim & Jew etcEstablishing the covenant

3.We will unite against anyone who practices evil, seek to bring harm, sin, aggression even if he be from our ownEstablishing the covenant:

2. Yathrib (Medina)shall be a safe place except for those who transgress their limits & become of the wrongdoersEstablishing the covenant:

Some of the agreements were 

1. No believer shall kill any believer for any NON-BELIEVER nor should they help3. Establishing the covenant:

The made objective to this is to set up role grounds & have a common understand that "THEY are ONE nation"2. Establishing a brotherhood:

To strengthen the ties between the Muhajiroon&Ansar.

Now history shows us the type of connect that was made1. Building a Masjid: 

The masjid was & STILL IS the center point for Muslims

A masjid plays many roles within our societyThe 4 projects:

1. Building a masjid
2. Establishing a brotherhood
3. A covenant to govern the communities of Madina
4. Establishing a Army1. Upon Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam's arrival to Madina he set up 4 projects to establish...2. 

3. Playing with your wife
4. Learning how to swim."

- This hadith is authentic & can be found in various hadith books.1. Everything that is not in the remembrance of Allah is a waste of time except 4 things:

1. Walking between targets
2. Training your horse2.

To punish&humiliate the enemies of Allah
Exposing the Hypocrites
A defense against aggression from the enemies that transgress the ummah1. The 7 objectives of Jihad:

The promotion of Islam
To protect worship places
Protect the world from corruption
To test mankind (a trail)5 requirements for Jihad:

Must be Muslim
Age of Puberty
Sanity
To be free from disabilities
Financial stable

-Requiments set by RasulullahSpending in the way of Allah... 

Allah has promised, whatever you spend (in terms of wealth) Feesaabilillah will be brought back to you.Who was the 1st nation to establish Jihad?

Answer: Bani Israel (The Ummah of Musa Alayhi Sallam)What does Jihad also do? 

Answer: Through Jihad Allah separates those on the truth from those who have Nifaq within them.What's the purpose for Jihad?

To free the people from servitude of one another & becoming servants of Allah & the Hukum be for AllahThe only WAR allowed in Islam is fighting in the Path of Allah other wars are NOT recognized or accepted. Evidence is in Surah Nisaa ayah 763. But then Islam gave it a new meaning to the word Jihad which is "To fight against the Enemies of Allah"<---- Agreed upon by the 4 Madhabs2. The same for the word "Jihad" the Arabic term for this originally was "to struggle or strive"1. Salah in the Arabic language means "Submission" but after islam came it gave it a new meaning "prayer"Okay let me educate the masses... 

(The student within me is coming out lol)Class is in session..

May Allah bless Sheikh Ahmad Musa Jibril for providing us with these Tawheed classes!! http://t.co/Q8nZIPC3ovWith that I conclude this rant with this... 

"This religion is Nasheeha." 

Use twitter wisely because you will be questioned about it ...May Allah bless Muslim twitter because through here I have met some amazing people.... 

May Allah unite us either in Dunya or in Jannah.And don't ruin ur intentions for a few followers u may gain along the way, because ur followers will either be a witness for or against uDon't ruin an opportunity to gain Ajar by constantly worrying about how many retweets you got.Twitter can be an amazing dawah source but one must constantly check & recheck their intentions.Everything we do should be only for Allah, & that's something that we should always remind ourselves...May Allah keep our hearts firm upon His Deen and make us of those people who remind others for "Verily, reminders benefit the believers. "Pretty much that's what twitter has become lol but Instagram is on some other level of ridiculous tbh... 

Let me not talk about itFan Girls need to be taught what Hayaah is, it's getting way too disgusting tbh. & the brothers that feed off of it need to be slapped hardFree mixing has become an all time high, & what annoys me the most are those Mujahideen "Groupies" AdunyaaaI hardly see reminders whenever I come on twitter, honestly all I see is junk tweets or sisters getting cozy with the opposite sex 

ADUNYAAIt seems as if people only tweet to please others & the trend in doing so is calling Dawlah "khawarij" K 

Whatever flows your boat mateThis side of twitter has honestly lost its plot. Idk where to even start tbh, it was fun while things lasted but everything comes to an endEven peeking over to the dark side isn't the same, there's way to much annoyance & stupidity that has entered their realm.Old school twitter was the golden era, now half of the people have either become Shuhada (iA), Made Hijrah, sadly got locked up, or left...I even prefer the old school jihadi "analysts" over the new ones sorry folks... Old school twitter had everything tbh, now it's just BLAAHEspecially bios of people who have disclaimers.. Lool people are getting more creative & funny if I may add

But Old school twitter > newAnother favorite pass time hobby of mine on twitter is reading people's Bios LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL people are helluh creative...Whenever I find a small pass time I go on Sheikh Assim Al-Hakim's account & read his replies tbh...

Legit i think he's funnyAssalaamu alaykum, any news on Tuhin& Mustaqim yet?Hi, can we be friends @FlamessOfwar? 

LooolRT @FlamessOfwar: @_UmmWaqqas hijab is fardh, niqāb is fardh.I laughed so hard reading that article, like he's helluh funny. Not only that but he has all these kufar so scared, wallah I'm in tearsLoool the funniest article I've read in years..

Erm the Sahaba did beheading etc ya3ni this is history@BananaAndRiceP2 legit there on some different level type of stuff, perhaps it's to safeguard their visas@BananaAndRiceP2 Al-Maghrib has lost the plot, epically now. Fam they're beyond watering down the Deen they're straight lyingRT @BananaAndRiceP2: @_UmmWaqqas al maghrib used to be the bomb. Oh wait I can't use the B word. I mean wicked. Now its too much. They doin…Loool @ the Al-Maghrib Institute, it's crazy how much people will lie just to water down the deen erm. K

You and another person lolOi I know Hijab is Fardh "wajib" just got tweeted instead lolIf only us sisters truly understood the beauty of Hijab.RT @Ayesh2008: @_UmmWaqqas hijab is fard though and niqab is wajibRT @FatimaTaughtYou: @_UmmWaqqas #TweetOfTheYear 👏👏👏👏This is not to look down on sisters who don't wear Hijab, but let's not cover up sin by making excuses...Allah made the Hijab wajib, the case is closed.Regardless of what propaganda you try to use, you can NEVER justify not wearing Hijab. Sorry, you just can'tSorry but.
1. Hijab is Wajib & you're openly sinning if you don't wear it 
2. Those who wear Hijab & those who don't are different ...Lool why do people feel the need to put Niqaabis on blast just to make an excuse for those who don't wear Hijab?This Masjid is stunning...

My heart ♡Jk I'm nothing, I'm just a simple Servant of Allah whose mission in life is to please Him.Anyways, before my mentions blow up again let me do a disclaimer.

Hi my tweets are "not" an endorsement. I'm just an "analyst"

LOLI always "Lol" when I come across bios that say " RT =/= Endorsements" Errm the Kufar still think you're a supporter though.

Nice try :-)Sitting on my kitchen counter whilst I drink milk lol just strolling through twitter don't mind me :*Banana retweet him on my TL & bruv I haven't laughed so hard in ages tbhLike the way he replies to us is beyond jokes & the funniest part is that he's so serious in his sarcasmLol I was trolling last night & seen a tweet/reply from Sheikh Assim Al-Hakim & laughed so hard. He's mad funny inni 

Like he got jokes3. & who is truer to his promise than Allāh? So, rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success."-Tawbah 1112.They fight in Allāh's cause. So, they kill & are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Torah, Gospel & the Quran1 "Verily, Allāh has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for the price that Paradise will be theirs.RT @_1Imran: Get used to a rough life, for luxury does not last forever.

You have to put your whole trust solely in Allah & take that jump."2. For those who don't get to complete their hijrah know that you will get all its Ajar but if ONLY your Niyaah was solely for Allah's sake.1. Should you die on your path of making Hijrah know that with Allah is your reward.But Allah has promised those who leave their homes SOLELY for His sake two things: 

1. Protection in the Land
2. ProvisionMajority of the time people avoid making Hijrah for two reasons

1. Fear for Safety
2. Fear for their RizqGiving up ur comfortable life for the sake of Allah isn't easy, but the reward Allah gives u in return is proven to be worth the hardships.Glad Tidings to those who made the ultimate exchange with Allah. 

May their abode be Jannah underneath which rivers flow.@bintdad__ follow me pleaseJannah is all I yarn for May Allah permit is to enter it.May Allah grant us all what we seek both in this life & in the next...I give bayaah to Allah, His Rasul & His DeenAnd I have no desire to live in this dunya, for my aspirations is for the hereafter.@IzaSheikha nahh not if I pass off their husband lol

Ya3ni I'm maskeenRT @_abumunira: @nikkimanhaj You have indeed slandered, Please to refrain. @_UmmWaqqas@KalthumMohamed ukht there is no compulsion in Islam, don't believe everything on TVRT @nikkimanhaj: Open supporter of ISIS, calls for people to go to Syria, glorifies terrorism: @_UmmWaqqas@AmeenOutspoken @umm_muthanna No disrespect but you should read more into this even the scholars of the 4 madhabs agree to this@KalthumMohamed what about the Muslims killed by the Kufar? Do we not have a right to defend ourselves?You lot are making me reckless, Errm can I go back to tweeting about daisies and flowers lol

I don't want to be on the "No Flight" list :PHijrah will continue & the caravan will move on, and the dog will keep barking!I honestly believe things are better done with a Mahram thoughDon't get things mixed up, I'm not telling sisters to run away from home but just saying.Just like you don't need a "Mahram" for Siyaam and Salaah if believe Hijrah is Fardh Ayn upon you then you DONT need a mahram..@Intr8vert If you believe hijrah is Fardh upon you, then you don't need a Mahram.Lol did you lot miss the Hadith that Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said "Hijrah will CONTINUE till the day of Judgment"If those sisters did indeed leave for Shaam they are more of a man then you are! 

Yes, I said it! Sue meYou lot always clamp down on sisters who make Hijrah in your cozy homes. HELLO BUT Hijrah is fardh on ALL of us, not just the women ya know.I think the regime of Saudi Arabia & Gulf states should reread & study the Seerah again... Allahu Mustaan2. In the covenant it stated "NO BELIEVER SHALL KILL FOR ANY NON-BELIEVER NOR SHALL HE HELP ANY NON-BELIEVER AGAINST A BELIEVER"1. Anyways I was studying the Seerah of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam & came across a covenant that the people of Medina all signedAny who may Allah protect Umm Yasir & grant her what she seeks! Keep her in your duas pleaseThese kufar plot day & night & attack us from the skies only to have an American plane shot down by a 16 year old Mujahid Allahu Akbar!Just like the west needs to wake up and realize that the sleeping Muslims have finally woken up from their slumber alhamdulilahWe Muslims need to wake up and realize that the Khalifah is here & it's NOT GOING ANY WHERE Bi ithnillah...

Baqiyyah innitPeople with disabilities from all parts of the world have flocked to live under the Khalifah, then there is us....

Allah chooses the peopleSo many people along with their entire families have made Hijrah to the Islamic State yet some of us stay in the west though we have means.So many Somalis & have made Hijrah to Shaam I'm so shocked & they all happen to be under the age of 30 alhamdulilahPretty much in UK you're a terrorist until proven a coconut. .. SubhanAllah May allah help the Muslims in UKAnyways duty calls! 

Baqiyyah Bi ithnillah! 

Assalaamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh!  

Keep me in your duas please :-)Brothers take this advice from Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen: 

"Marry a religious woman. She will neither abuse your right nor reveal your secrets."My last retweet is on point tbh. A man with deen is like a diamond in the rough. Super hard to find, especially one with the correct aqeedah@flurriana please don't I'm currently starving!RT @yasminqanas: Trust me sisters having a good pious brother is better than having a man that has money.Anyways that tuna & bread lifestyle isn't that bad tbh it actually tastes good... 

If you know then you know....Our victories lie in this Deen not some nationalistic flag that these Kufar came up with to separate us2. But until then this ummah will live in humiliation and be disgraced begging these Kufars for basic rights...

 Allahu Mustaan1. The moment us Muslims put down those nationalistic flags & pick up the Rayyat At-Tawheed is when we will become successful@_Knt28_ awh I've missed you too errm DM me so I can give you my KIKPalestine will ONLY be free the way it was freed in the past, through Jihad Feesaabilillah!  

Whether you like it or not this realityAs bait as this may be ima say it..

Wallahi Palestine will NEVER be free through those pathetic "peace talks" or get freedom through the UNAllah says: "Remind, for reminders benefit the believers."

[51:56]When you turn to Allah don't worry about the means, guidance will come.You don't want to spend one second regretting things expecially in a world that will only last a short term.Sometimes life can get so overwhelming but sitting back and thinking about your blessing can honestly balance things out.Allah tests those whom He loves, may Allah give us patience to deal with our Qadr in the best manner & to accept it whole heartedlyJust heard sad news, people do me a favor and keep my dear ones in your duas.RT @jabirzaan: @_UmmWaqqas @ShamiWitness @isisnews01 @Nameless_ukhti @MuslimPrisoners http://t.co/6XJgidBD2TAll you Bint & Umm Jihadis need full on tazkiyyah, plus a honest sister who is about the manhaj wouldn't waste her time chatting up guys tbhBrothers don't fall for the traps of women ya3ni take it from me, WOMEN ARE FITNAH!!!!This is another reason why I don't trust over the top bait fan girls.

Allahu MustaanFear Allah in ALL matters of the Deen. & fear Allah concerning your AkhriahBrothers remember why you left in the first place, it was to escape the fitnah. SubhanAllah don't fall for the fitnah of NisaaBrothers my sincerest advice 1. don't accumulate sins for some sister who isn't even ready to give up free mixing 2. Don't waste ur timeIf marriage is what you brothers seek with these sisters MAKE IT KNOWN and allow it with the free mixing. Wallah Allah is watching youFEAR ALLAHAnd brothers, you are in the land of Ribaat why are you chatting up with sisters under the pretenses of "helping" them SubhanAllahYou sisters need to refresh your intentions and be truthful to yourselves and STOP using this as a way to get close to these brothersWallah it's disgusting seeing how sisters freely act on social media, and this isn't anything new it's been going on for awhile4. You lot can't even give up free mixing yet you want to give up "everything" for the sake of Allah? Khayr 

Reevaluate your life3. You catch them chatting up with many brothers and getting cozy via Twitter and Instagram.  

No Hayaah2. But you still find them stuck in the same position for over a year regardless if they have the resources.... Allahu Mustaan.1. Sisters this one is for you, lately you find sisters who seem to be on the Manhaj & say they want Hijrah etc but....Sorry but ima go on a rant about something that has been bothering me for some time.... 

Bismillah.

This life is nothing but pure deception4- no matter how much you want to stay, the truth of hijrah and sham is indeed true &when the time of Mahdi comes there is nothing u can do3- when you actually sit down & open your heart &read what's in the books of Hadith on what the Rasullallah SAW said abt Sham. You will run2-Sooner rather than later. And those of you who are stuck in worrying about whether or not ISIS is the truth or hijrah for women is bad1- It's doesn't matter if dawlah is a legit khalifah or not, the truth of the matter is Sham will be the land of lailallaha illallahAm I the only one that gets marriage proposals via mentions? 😭 😭 😭Awh my followers are the best tbh, I get messages from people saying "I love you feesaabilillah." 

Made my day"The best of Deeds are those kept secret."Don't ruin the great reward of Hijrah or even Jihad just to receive fame, compliments, recognition from the creation.Rewards are according to ur intentions by the way, don't think u will be rewarded if ur intentions were only for fame or to gain somethingTypos Fi Ded.Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam once said "Be discrete with your intentions to avoid ayn" <-- not exact words but pretty muchIf you live in the west you should be bait on social media & express your desires to make Hijrah etc but don't sugarcoat your Deen either.What Allah has prepared for us in Jannah is better than we would ever imagine.This is so amazing.

Not my business doeLoool alhamdulilah I stopped taking their classes a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL TIME AGO, too much watering down the Deen.Lol sorry but Al-Maghrib Institute had their instructor telling Muslims to vote for Obama, now they want to talk about "Un-Islamic"Something that I always try to remind myself. http://t.co/r5r6ELwrsqاخي أبلغ هنا الأصحاب أني راحل مدير@panadriam what you may think is wrong may actually be right... the Fiqh of Jihad isn't all black and white as some people like to point it@panadriam it was to make a statement that yes Sahaba even did beheadings, and the similarity is to strike fear into their hearts...I love you @bintladen1Anyways I need to stop getting brave via Twitter, I can't be on a "no flight" list ya know... Like im a frequent flyerWe know that the BIG battle will take place in Shaam... Khayr Bi ithnillahAla Kulli haal Obama saying he's about to enter Syria is actually him acting out the Hadith of Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam.You lot should read Sheikh Yusuf Uraydi's book titled "Constants of Jihad" SubhanAllah the way he breaks down things is amazing ya know...Yet Muslims cry about the status the ummah is in and make comments like " we need a Khalid Ibn Waleed"

It's the same old song tbh.2. But the moment Muslims decide to retaliate in any way shape of form, we Muslims are the first to condemn.1. Not to sound heartless or anything, but I honestly don't understand when it's Muslims being oppressed everyone is mute.Where is all this out cry when Muslims are being oppressed? SubhanAllah it's like OUR blood don't matter.Why because America is spilling it?Ibn Masood beheaded Abu Jahl & brought his head to Rasulullah SAW & Rasulullah SAW screamed with Takbeers... 

Daleel is in Bukhariكيف أحزن و الله ربي؟ 

How can I be sad if Allah is my Lord?Muslim twitter is differently the most watched and analyzed.Hi I'm a coconut, can you lot stop harassing me please? Like, I don't want 10000000000000x notifications on my phone a day.Watching the new episode of the Light Series titled "Lies against Dawla"

Honestly it brings you closer to AllahI wanted a lot of things but Alhamdulilah Allah granted me what I truly wanted.

Text me thoughHe was so cute, he would always come and sit on my lap & tell me he loves me. Awh I miss him tbhSpeaking of husbands, I found a Tunisian husband by the name of Baraa. But here is the downside 

1. He's only 4 
2. He moved out my blockIma remind him of the type of husband Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam was. Ya3ni he held his own when it came to houseworkLol my husband will pamper me ya3ni I'm too prestige to clean and cook all the time. Just sayingI agree with ikran, my husband should be the one to give me foot massages. It's the 21st century ya3ni loooooolYou lot want to real brave but stay mute when I'm around Loool...Slandering me for what? K, btw I know 100% who you are so no need for anonymous accounts. You're still a coward beyond the computer screenLol at these females that want to get brave via social media, your 15 minutes of fame is over ya3ni... 

Thanxs for the Deeds though :)@muslimah4321 Lol you're some off brand that thinks they know me, calm yourself don't let twitter fool ya.RT @NickiManhaj: Every man should always meet their wives at the door when they get home with a plate of hot food and a foot massage.May Allah bless our Mujahideen in Dawlatul Islam. May Allah grant them victory over their enemies, & bless the Islamic State!Lool at those people calling dawla khawarij... They're still Mujahideen whom Allah preferred over you! 

SORRY NOT SORRYIt's sad to see people bash Mujahideen from the comfort of their homes, but at the end Allah prefers them over you.Think twice before belittling something that had to do with you Deen, don't leave the fold of Islam just to impress a bunch of KufarsLike Allah said "They will NEVER be pleased with you till you forsake your religion."And as far as Jihad goes, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said "Jihad will continue till the day of Judgment."Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam was a lion, don't be fooled by these coconut sheikhs LEARN YOUR DEEN...You forget that Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam was the man that stood in front of the Quraysh & said "I've come to slaughter you"1. Did you know Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi spent all his life in Jihad? 2. He took part in only 1 Hajj & 1 umrah..1.

One of the lectures which changed my life. 

May Allah reward him and increase his rank in Jannah!!!RT @Ukht_Muwaahida: Jannah is not cheapMany of us claim we want Jannah, but not a lot of us are willing to make sacrifices for it.Many of us are blinded by the glitter of this world & forget about the beauty of Jannah.We all want happiness, sadly many of us are trying to seek it in this Dunya & forget that there is life waiting for us after we die.Jannah is the aim for many of us, but not everyone is willing to work for it.The path to Jannah isn't easy but wallahi it's worth it. http://t.co/zTyVNvF8QYMay Allah grant us all what we are seeking both in this life and the next!

What better izzah is there than that?Victory was PROMISED to the ummah of Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam 1400 years ago & Bi ithnillah we will successThe ummah isn't what it was 5 years ago & these kufar governments know it, we are gaining our Izzah back.The Hikmah of Allah is something amazing, the "Arab spring" was a tool by to awaken the sleeping ummah. 

Our lions have fully awakenHonestly boggles my mind how sisters go on Instagram & write certain comments on a brother's profile... Allahu MustaanAll of these Mujahideen groupies need to have the Hayaah slapped back into them.

💖3. He was endowed with great wisdom and a sense of dignity and self esteem"

He was the definition of Tall dark and Handsome <32. A fine nose and bright skin. He was also gifted with a deep, melodious, resonant voice. He wore a beard which was thin on both cheeks.1. The description of Bilal Radi Allahu Anhu ... 

"He was of a handsome and impressive stature, dark brown complexion with sparkling eyesHow Bilal Radi Allahu Anhu became a slave is interesting. His family was captured during the Amul-Fil and sold as slaves..Anyways... 

Did you guys know that Bilal Ibn Rabah Radi Allahu Anhu's mother the princess of Abysinna?

He was royalty!

His life though >>May Allah make us of people who actually take the Salaf as their role models through our actions, not through the keyboards!

1. Fear Allah
2. Deactivate
3. Reevaluate your life
4. Personally i think you're a wasteWallah they stay making 70+ excuses to their leaders who openly sin, but when it comes to their brothers its automatic "Khawarij" "Takfeeri"The dark side depresses me, how can you be so hateful towards your own muslim brother?

"There can be no Islam in the person who does not perform salah." Umar Ibn Khattab"When one’s intention is sincere, Allah will suffice his needs, protect him, and guide him in his dealings."-Umar Ibn KhattabUmar replied, “we are people who have been given respect because of Islam & therefore do not wish any substitute.”If you ride a Turkish horse and wear some other clothing, it would command more respect in the eyes of the Romans.1. When Palestine was conquered, a priest said to Umar, “u are the leader of the Muslims, it is not befitting that u ride a camel in here.لَمَّا قَضَى اللَّهُ الْخَلْقَ كَتَبَ فِي كِتَابِهِ فَهُوَ عِنْدَهُ فَوْقَ الْعَرْشِ إِنَّ رَحْمَتِي غَلَبَتْ غَضَبِيThere are those who simply read the Quran, & then there are those who live it.Another one who i make dua gets Hidayaah is Dr. Mads Gilbert SubhanAllah, May Allah bless him with Islam & Jannah@Muawiyaaa I like the work she's been doing especially the away she helps the muslims, she seems sincere tbh.May Allah Guide Angelina Jolie to Islam, I pray Allah gives her the Hidayaah & opens her heart to the truth...Anyways i leave you with the Advice of Rasululilah Salallahu Alayhi Wasallam 

"Safeguard your relationship with Allah"The way Allah loved Bani Israel is something to look closely into as well, even though they were the chosen people Allah sealed their heartsMusa Alayhi Sallam was the only Boss that punched The angel of death in the Eye lol he's top DON ! ❤️Musa Alayhi Sallam is honestly one of my favorite people. His story brings about so much emotions & has so much hidden gems!@laafemmefatale Yeah, SubhanAllah i think that hadith just highlights the mercy of Allah.@laafemmefatale Have you ever come across the hadith about what Jibril AS did to firaun?Goes to show us you may plan but at the end Allah is the best of planners@laafemmefatale He out did Iblees on that one tbh. AuthobililahNahh but look how Allah plans. Musa Alayhi Sallam was raised by Firaun himself, though he was a males & he belonged to Bani Israel.& How he easily said "im your Lord most high" LIKE he was so arrogant & beyond self centered.For instance when the Magicians said "We believe in the Lord of Musa & Haroon" this guy had the audacity to say "Did i give you permission"Looking closely at the story of Musa Alayhi Salaam you will realize that Firaun was beyond arrogant.There is a phrase that is constantly on the tongues of the Fuqaha

"ʹRepelling something is easier than removing it.""Some people have passed away, but their character has kept them alive, others are alive, but their character has killed them." Imam Shafi’iRT @DesertSecrets: @_UmmWaqqas 
"O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do?"

[Al-Saff; 61:2]RT @DesertSecrets: @_UmmWaqqas 

"Most hateful it is with Allah that you say that which you do not do."

[Al-Saff; 61:3]& with that i end my mini rant. May Allah rectify our condition & make us steadfast on His Deen!@idiopathically Lol BYE i didnt do anything...Before advising others MAKE SURE you are acting accordingly concerning what you are giving Nasheeha to.We should all Fear Allah & remember this Ayah in Surah Saf, Allah says:

 "O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do?Manners is key, hence why the Salaf spent years learning basic manners before any knowledge..And how do you expect people to take your Naseeha seriously when you ridicule people?What good are your good deeds when you are freely giving handing them out with such ease... Wallah its actually astonishing@idiopathically Lol i can't bait the person out like thatYou can have all the khayr and reminders you want, but what good is it when all you're doing is slandering & belittling the masses?And in the following ayah Allah says "Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive it not."4. In Surah Baqarah Allah says "And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption on the earth," they say, "We are but reformers."3. Because they feel like they're "warning" people from a certain person or path. & Wallah all that was replaying in my head were two ayats2. Then i came across tweets full of disrespect, slander, all out backbiting. And what shocks me is that they feel its okay ....1. I came across a twitter account which is seemingly full of reminders & khayr"O people who take pleasure in a life that will vanish; falling in love with a fading shadow is sheer stupidity."-Ibn QayyimThe more you learn about the Deen of Allah the more you realize how much of a Jahl you really are.To listen & listen carefully to his words. He is Saadiq Al-Amin he doesn't need to swear, but he did so, so that we may listen attentivelyAlso many times we find hadiths where Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam is swearing by Allah's name, it's a warning towards us to listenThe process of declaring a hadith Fabricated or even weak is so long, wallah scholars of Hadith spend months analyzing one simple hadith.RT @Ansariyya: @_UmmWaqqas @UmmEmotionLess well he might know those 3 
But if he doesnt fear Allah then ur in trouble plenty hav ilm very f…My advice for you is

Expect bare minimum from rest. Don't listen to rowdah and read Fiqh…@BananaAndRiceP2 Regardless if people follow them or not, they were there so that we know whats acceptable or not.@BananaAndRiceP2 There's more to marriage rights then a guy not beating you ukht.People don't even know their rights let alone their spouses but constantly want to speak about marriage... 

Ummm K@BananaAndRiceP2 Kitabul Nikkah is a must for people to know in my opinion..I think people should study the Fiqh of Nikkah before even considering marriage, educate yourself on your rights sweetheartRT @ForeverHayatii: Yep....

Ramadan is the month where you learn about the REAL YOU!Today you have no one to blame for your sins but yourself, i think we should reevaluate ourselves on just that...Theres never a better time to change than Ramadan, you have 3 weeks left make the best of it in hopes of changing...Aren't you tired of always sinning? Isn't your heart empty & always feeling a void? Wallah its because you lack a connection with Allah..First week of ramadan has passed, have you made the attempts to even change?

Moutasem Al-Hameedi

Recitations like theirs pls >@Nadera__ Sad thing is they have no Shaytaan to blame for their disgusting behavior2. He actually breaks down & weeps, like its so hard for him to read those ayats, so he chokes trying to hold back tears..1. SubhanAllah i find it amazing that whenever Moutasem Al-Hameedi comes to ayats talking about how the people accused Allah of having a son@Nadera__ LOOOL its only for retweets which is disgusting, no type of hayaah tbh@ThatRevert Lol trust me i have many faults & people have been quick to correct me on them, perks of Muslim twitter tbh@ThatRevert No problem, hopefully you correct me when im wrong In Shaa Allah@Nadera__ yeah thats a huge red line. unless they're an ailm & they've studied taharah throughly & have the ijazaah to prove it@ThatRevert i know but still we should hide the faults of others even those unknown to the majority@ThatRevert you shouldn't bait her out like that salmanIt truly has all the answers we seek. Its just that sometimes we just don't look hard enough, which is sad & a loss on our end.There are so many lessons & gems can be picked up in all throughout the Quran,"Indeed this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me."-Surah Anbiya Ayah 92Amazing Ayats to read to give you an iman boost about who we shouldn't doubt Allah concerning our duasFrom Nuh Alayhi Sallam to Zakriya Alayhi Sallam Allah tell us their duas & describes to us their state they were in whilst making those duas2. Those ayats are showing that nothing is too big for Allah to grant, No dua is impossible for Allah. The key is truthfulness & yakeen1. Surah Anbiya Ayahs 75-92 are incredible, one of the reasons being how Allah mentions certain duas of each Nabi & how He accepted them"Whoever does not intend to fast from the night before, there is no fast for him." 

[صحيح الترمذي (٥٧٣)، حسنه الألباني]@ZumarulJannah Lol FGS he's amazing, i only like Ghamdis when he's reciting the 40 hadiths tbhim such a huge fan of Salah Bukhtir's reaction but Moutasem Al-Hameedi is slowly growing on me...@ZumarulJannah Nah im a huge fan of Bukhatir but Moutasem is growing on me@ZumarulJannah SubhanAllah its sad you should listen to Moutasem Al-Hameedi recite it...The last couple of ayats in Surah Maryam is heavy on my heart..

"Whoever fasts and does not pray, his fast is not accepted by Allah"  

[Noor ala darab no. 26]Especially when you understand the Ayahs the Imam is reading & what is leading him to cry... Ya Rabb so much raw emotionsWallah when you understand the Ayahs you are reading or that are being recited in Taraweeh its that much powerful, Emotional & iman boostingI understand the pain that is not spoken but seen through the eyes.10. Our Dhikr - Wasted, because it does not affect us or our hearts9. Our Service - Wasted in service of someone who will not bring us closer to Allaah, or benefit in dunyaa8. Our Intellect - Wasted on things that are not beneficial, that are detrimental to society &individual, not in contemplation or reflection7. Our Time - Wasted, not used properly, to compensate for that which has passed, by doing what is righteous to make up for past deeds6. Our Love - Our emotional love is misdirected, not towards Allah, but towards something/someone else...5. Our Bodies - Wasted because we don’t use them in ibadah & service of Allah4. And  a feeling of peace and contentment. In its place, our hearts are filled with something or someone else 

Part 24. Our Hearts - Wasted because they are empty from the love of Allah, & the feeling of longing to go to Him

Part 13.
3. Our Wealth- Wasted by using on things that will not bring us reward. We waste our money,our status,our authority,which have no benefit2. 

1. Our Knowledge - Wasted by not taking action with it 

2. Our Actions - Wasted by committing them with out sincerity1. 10 Things we Waste

You should read more, you'll love itI could go on & on About the miracles that were granted to the Prophets. That mini list gives no type of Justice tbh3.

Sulayman commanded the Jinns, & could hear animals 
Adam was given an insight to all things (except that which Allah kept hidden)2.

Musa Split the sea & could speak to Allah directly
Ibrahim was thrown in fire & did not Burn 
Muhammed split the Moon1. Each Prophet was given a special blessing from the mercy of Allah... 

Example:

Isa healed the blind & sick
Yusuf interpreted dream 100%@Al_Muhajiroun That was Musa ukht... @UmmUmar_I love all the Prophets to only name one... Each one of them have life lessons you could learn from not to mention their iman & sacrifices..Ibn Kathir's book Al Bidayaah is so detailed & in-depth SubhanAllah@zauq Ibn Kathir2. Hawa was sent down on a land which today is recognized as Mecca   & Adam was sent down on a land which is now recognized as India1. When Adam & Hawa were taken to earth they were spilt up, Adam traveled the ends of the earth to be with his wife..

315 Messengers sent down
24,000 Nabis sent down

From that we were only told about 25 by name...There is a difference between a Nabi & a Rasul.. For instance every Nabi is not a Rasul but every Rasul is a Nabi2.

2. Rasululilah SAW's duas are alway accepted1.

But seems like people have fallen so deep into his trap that even after he's locked up they still do his bidding..2. One thats the whole point of Ramadan, as stated in Surah Baqarah.

Their mind frame on those allegations make no sense to me.And to keep it frank the difference between a Hijabi & a Non Hijabi is that one decided to obey the commandment of her Lord.Everyone has flaws & weakness,but lets not exploit that for personal reasons to make yourself feel better as to why you don't wear the HijabNo one is perfect regardless of what act of ibadaah you are doing. But at least you are trying & your reward is with Allah..im only saying this because im tired of seeing pictures of what they view the difference of a hijabi & non Hijabi is to justify things..Kindly refrain from using a hijabi's "mannerisms" to justify why you don't wear the Hijab.. That argument will be invalid in front of Allah.People are constantly out to prove Hijabis aren't perfect... Ummm we never claimed we were!

Back then there was no "don't judge him" or "you don't know what's in their heart" Muslims were known by their actions2. Those lands were conquered by the sword, but people converted to Islam through the actions they've witness from Muslims...1.

But its still awks how they know more about a women physical issue than most women.I use to find studying women fiqh from a man awkward especially when he talks about certain topics, but now its completely normal...@SalafiQueenOfNW @TheAbFro Are you 100% sure?Why do somalis hate on bantus?

swerve you stole their land from them...I was dead & now im alive.. i attempted to catch up on my lost sleep, im such a failRT @BananaAndRiceP2: “@Lathanay: “@BoyOfTheHorn: You just do what you gotta do https://t.co/co5AFM4GES”😩😩😩😩😩😩” this is why I dislike Somali…RT @hussain_mIj: Few more days left and Muslims be like http://t.co/6cXGsddAYt2.

Fear Allah & 2. Get some Hayaa 

sorry not sorryThat's the beauty about Islam irregardless if you achieve your goals if your intentions are correct Allah will reward you for your effortsSabr is knowing that no matter the outcome Allah will reward you for your efforts.Tawakkul is like climbing on top of a mountain & jumping without knowing what is at the bottom.Ikhlas & tawakkul are two peas in a pond, without one you can't have the other.Tawakkul isn't leaned by reading books, it's taught when you're placed in certain situations. It brings about calmness & real true reliance.Patience is always rewarded http://t.co/Q6VSm7wQ9XThe Quran was revealed to the whole of mankind but it addresses you as an independent individual...

Take heed in the ayahs & to understandWhen Allah says "Oh you who believe" He taking directly to U. When the stories of Prophets are addressed it's to remind U of their struggleWhat better encouragement do we have then the Quran itself? Surly the words of Allah was sent to YOU as an INDIVIDUAL..Verily His promise is true!Those advises Allah leaves us throughout the Quran >>> 

Its an iman booster knowing Allah is talking directly to you.Surah Rum Ayah 60 http://t.co/KOUPpjNHMyFor example if you're a Muhsin you are both a Muslim & a Mumin.

It's completely wrong to bring up anyone's family in any case & 2. How do you know they don't gave Nasheeha?I've seen this many times where people cracked down on a brother/sister who reminds them of certain sins. SubhanAllah Fear Allah pls3. But what irritates me is when other people drop that "your family isn't even practicing, preach to them" line on you2. They doubt you even before you picked yourself up from the ground. Which is actually sad1. The hardest thing to do is to give proper Nasheeha to close family or even friends... because in a way there your biggest critics.@_pearlism Yeah, anything to get praise it seems like tbh@_pearlism I think that's so rude & egoisticim hungry@Shahzaib_A94 the list is too many to say especially with twitter's 140 limitA way to test a "pro polygamist" is to ask her if she's willing to be the 3rd or 4th wife if she flat out denies then just straight flexing."@ummharith_: @_UmmWaqqas im going holland soon in shaa Allah ill see you there ;)"

Or have neglected to make Tawabah, hence why people in Jahanam begg Allah to be sent back & given another chance2. I think that applies perfectly with some of Jahanam's populations.
